				"title": "In Rough Justice, a Crown Court judge looks at how we treat crime committed by, or against, women",
				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780857529671\">Rough Justice</a> by Wendy Joseph.</p>\n<p>This a sort of sequel to Joseph&rsquo;s previous book, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781473597778\">Unlawful Killings</a>, which I <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/04/21/unlawful-killings-insights.html\">read last year</a>, although you could happily read them in either order.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s organised in a very similar way to her former offering. Wendy Joseph was a Crown Court judge. She takes us through a set of cases that are technically fictional but based on an amalgam of real trials, detailing what happens in the court room. So we get a mix of law-and-order but trueish-crime style stories along with information about court procedures and points of law that it behoves us to know about our justice system.</p>\n<p>This time we have two themes that she focuses on via her selection of cases.</p>\n<p>The first is the topic of justice itself. She notes that our approach to punishment has softened over time; no more do we legally disembowel, behead or hang perceived wrongdoers. But in terms of establishing the guilty/not guilty verdicts themselves, of bringing criminals to justice - whatever that means -  she asks whether we&rsquo;ve actually become all that more just over time or not.</p>\n<p>On that, her conclusion is distressingly unsure. Some attempts at progress have certainly been made, but was it all that we could have done, and are they given adequate priority?</p>\n<p>Some of the evidence for or against the proposition comes from comparisons of her modern-day cases with ones from the Old Bailey&rsquo;s extensive archives which often have distinct parallels.</p>\n<p>Her other focus is on cases involving women. Women commit less crime than men, and when they do so it tends to be more minor, less violent crime. There are of course exceptions. There&rsquo;s more than enough to construct some interesting cases to consider. Lawyers, jurors and other court staff can also of course be women. Society of course has dynamics we should consider that make all of these roles more challenging than they are for the typical man. The author herself witnessed and was subject to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61757147\">plenty of sexual harassment</a>.</p>\n<p>The book starts off with a case involving a man accused of sexually abusing a young girl.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [Rough Justice](https://micro.blog/books/9780857529671) by Wendy Joseph.\r\n\r\nThis a sort of sequel to Joseph's previous book, [Unlawful Killings](https://micro.blog/books/9781473597778), which I [read last year](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/04/21/unlawful-killings-insights.html), although you could happily read them in either order.\r\n\r\nIt's organised in a very similar way to her former offering. Wendy Joseph was a Crown Court judge. She takes us through a set of cases that are technically fictional but based on an amalgam of real trials, detailing what happens in the court room. So we get a mix of law-and-order but trueish-crime style stories along with information about court procedures and points of law that it behoves us to know about our justice system.\r\n\r\nThis time we have two themes that she focuses on via her selection of cases.\r\n\r\nThe first is the topic of justice itself. She notes that our approach to punishment has softened over time; no more do we legally disembowel, behead or hang perceived wrongdoers. But in terms of establishing the guilty/not guilty verdicts themselves, of bringing criminals to justice - whatever that means -  she asks whether we've actually become all that more just over time or not.\r\n\r\nOn that, her conclusion is distressingly unsure. Some attempts at progress have certainly been made, but was it all that we could have done, and are they given adequate priority?\r\n\r\nSome of the evidence for or against the proposition comes from comparisons of her modern-day cases with ones from the Old Bailey's extensive archives which often have distinct parallels.\r\n\r\nHer other focus is on cases involving women. Women commit less crime than men, and when they do so it tends to be more minor, less violent crime. There are of course exceptions. There's more than enough to construct some interesting cases to consider. Lawyers, jurors and other court staff can also of course be women. Society of course has dynamics we should consider that make all of these roles more challenging than they are for the typical man. The author herself witnessed and was subject to [plenty of sexual harassment](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61757147).\r\n\r\nThe book starts off with a case involving a man accused of sexually abusing a young girl. The next is a young lady accused of murdering, dismembering and disposing of the remains of an older lady. Then a wife who kills her husband after years of abuse. And finally, a grandmother, who together with her son, is in the dock for harbouring a weapon that led to tragedy in the hands of her grandson\r\n\r\nIn several of these cases there's not really much ambiguity as to whether at least part of the violent act was committed. But, even when we can figure out who did it, committing an act of violence isn't the same as committing the criminal offence of violence.\r\n\r\nKilling someone, for instance, has at least 6 potential defences one might consider.\r\n\r\n- The alibi: It wasn't me.\r\n- Accident: I didn't mean to do it.\r\n- Lack of intent: I wanted to hit him but not intending to do great harm.\r\n- Self-defence: I only hurt him to stop him hurting me.\r\n- Diminished responsibility: My mental condition reduces my responsibility for what I did.\r\n- Loss of control: He did or said something that would have made any reasonable person in my position snap.\r\n\r\nPart of Joseph's conclusion is that whilst reforming court practice is absolutely necessary and should be prioritised, there are places in the journey well before a case gets to the attention of a judge that must also be addressed.\r\n\r\nWe might ask why so much sexual violence, typically (but not always) committed against women of course, is not reported. And why so little of that which is reported is dropped before ever getting as far as to result a criminal charge, let alone a court case.\r\n\r\nAnd even earlier in the process; it's surely far preferable to stop a crime being committed in the first place than to have it considered after the fact by even the fairest of trials. Why then, in this case, do women commit crime? And why is crime committed against women? Is there anything in the understand of that could be used to prevent it in the first place?\r\n\r\nThe causes of crime are extensive and multifaceted - nature, nurture, lifestyle et al. But there are surely, for instance, social determinants of these matters, some of which society consistently fails to address.\r\n\r\nWhilst the court system must be dramatically improved - which involves committing substantial resources to it - we can ease the burden on it and, far more importantly, the horrific impact of crime on people's lives, by reducing the number of occasions where people feel compelled to commit crime in the first place.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/rj.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"615\" alt=\"Book cover for Rough Justice\">\n",

Granted it isn&rsquo;t under the same jurisdiction as the two aforementioned institutions, and it also<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Media_Group\"> isn&rsquo;t owned by a a cowardly tech billionaire</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>America’s moment of reckoning has arrived. On Tuesday, the nation will hold a presidential election like none before, poised between the historic candidacy of a Black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2024/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-presidential-election-2024-a-democratic-government-is-the-one-we-need\">Their formal endorsement</a>came a couple of weeks ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Defeating Mr Trump protects <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/washington-dc-role-play-second-trump-term\">democracy</a> from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A surprisingly (to me, perhaps it should not have been) good effort from a US based publication came from <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kamala-harris-but-a-donald-trump-win-would-be-catastrophic\">Teen Vogue&rsquo;s Harris endorsement</a>. They made the very valid point that even if you don&rsquo;t like Harris' policies - specifically in their case the actions taken on the Israel/Gaza conflict - Trump would be so much worse on the same things, and furthermore make it hard to organise against it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Donald Trump cannot win this election. Full stop.</p>\n<p>Right now, we have the power to make sure that doesn’t happen.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Autocrats thrive on overwhelming people. President Trump overwhelmed us every single day.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not enough to beat a fascist with razor-thin margins; ideally, we need to run up the margin of victory so high it becomes that much harder for Trump and his cronies to claim they represent the will of the American people.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Right now, we have the power to stop Trump. Should he win, we may not have these tools at our disposal again. Trump is on the record telling conservative Christians he just needs them to vote this year and then they won’t have to vote again. “Four more years, it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,” he said this summer, one of many comments that should have set off a weeks-long scandalous news cycle but got subsumed by, well, everything else. He has an army of election deniers ready to do his corrupt, anti-democratic bidding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In being censored by their owners from making an endorsement, the Washington Post and LA Times appear to have lost a lot of their subscribers. Semafor reports, in an article wonderfully titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business\">The Washington Post sold Democracy. Now it needs a new line of business</a>&rdquo; that the WaPo lost at least 200,000 of them - a cost <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/jeff-bezos-washington-post-endorsement-decision-cost-8-million-dollars/\">thought to represent</a> a possible $20 million in revenue. The LA Times lost at least 18,000, with both figures potentially still growing.</p>\n<p>This, <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business?ref=platformer.news\">in their view</a> is at least in part down to many subscribers to newspapers doing so as part of an effort to support &ldquo;capital-J journalism&rdquo; rather than merely improved access to a specific product&rsquo;s content.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans didn’t necessarily feel they needed the Post’s journalism or its service products, but they did want Journalism with a capital J, a force willing to take Trump on directly and to absorb his wrath when other institutions weren’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That feels right to me. Whenever I have subscribed to a newspaper it wasn&rsquo;t usually for the content.

				"content_text": "Unlike [the enfeebled Washington Post and LA Time](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/11/03/cowardly-tech-billionaires.html)s, the Guardian isn't pulling many punches on [its front page](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/white-house-race-armageddon-election). Granted it isn't under the same jurisdiction as the two aforementioned institutions, and it also[ isn't owned by a a cowardly tech billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Media_Group).\n\n>America’s moment of reckoning has arrived. On Tuesday, the nation will hold a presidential election like none before, poised between the historic candidacy of a Black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials.\n\n[Their formal endorsement](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2024/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-presidential-election-2024-a-democratic-government-is-the-one-we-need)came a couple of weeks ago:\n\n>It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Defeating Mr Trump protects [democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/washington-dc-role-play-second-trump-term) from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.\n\nA surprisingly (to me, perhaps it should not have been) good effort from a US based publication came from [Teen Vogue's Harris endorsement](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kamala-harris-but-a-donald-trump-win-would-be-catastrophic). They made the very valid point that even if you don't like Harris' policies - specifically in their case the actions taken on the Israel/Gaza conflict - Trump would be so much worse on the same things, and furthermore make it hard to organise against it.\n\n>Donald Trump cannot win this election. Full stop.\n>\n>Right now, we have the power to make sure that doesn’t happen.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Autocrats thrive on overwhelming people. President Trump overwhelmed us every single day.\n>\n>...\n\n>It’s not enough to beat a fascist with razor-thin margins; ideally, we need to run up the margin of victory so high it becomes that much harder for Trump and his cronies to claim they represent the will of the American people.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Right now, we have the power to stop Trump. Should he win, we may not have these tools at our disposal again. Trump is on the record telling conservative Christians he just needs them to vote this year and then they won’t have to vote again. “Four more years, it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,” he said this summer, one of many comments that should have set off a weeks-long scandalous news cycle but got subsumed by, well, everything else. He has an army of election deniers ready to do his corrupt, anti-democratic bidding.\n\nIn being censored by their owners from making an endorsement, the Washington Post and LA Times appear to have lost a lot of their subscribers. Semafor reports, in an article wonderfully titled \"[The Washington Post sold Democracy. Now it needs a new line of business](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business)\" that the WaPo lost at least 200,000 of them - a cost [thought to represent](https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/jeff-bezos-washington-post-endorsement-decision-cost-8-million-dollars/) a possible $20 million in revenue. The LA Times lost at least 18,000, with both figures potentially still growing.\n\nThis, [in their view](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business?ref=platformer.news) is at least in part down to many subscribers to newspapers doing so as part of an effort to support \"capital-J journalism\" rather than merely improved access to a specific product's content.\n\n>Hundreds of thousands of Americans didn’t necessarily feel they needed the Post’s journalism or its service products, but they did want Journalism with a capital J, a force willing to take Trump on directly and to absorb his wrath when other institutions weren’t.\n\nThat feels right to me. Whenever I have subscribed to a newspaper it wasn't usually for the content. There's[ more than enough information of interest](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/23/two-types-of.html) floating around the internet \"for free\" - free if you disregard the payment taken via the [secretive harvesting of your personal data](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/04/the-age-of.html) at least.\n\nIt was because I supported the process and the people that created that content; supported the effort to go out there, do the no doubt often grueling work that stands some chance of informing us about reality, and critically, to expose and challenge the powerful when they lie to or otherwise abuse us.\n\nNot that this should be the point, but endorsing Harris certainly didn't cost the Guardian much in terms of subscriber or direct revenue. Rather it apparently let to a big increase in donations - around $2 million - making it, [according to the Press Gazette](https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/betsy-reed-guardian-us/):\n\n>...one of the most successful subscription marketing messages in the history of online news.\n",

For example, they&rsquo;ve both been repeatedly taken to court over various violations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He gets very enthusiastic, and sometimes he might exaggerate,” Hentz said. “He can embellish a little.” Outcomes for his diabetes treatment were disappointing, and one case ended tragically.</p>\n<p>While pursuing this therapy, he also began researching chemotherapy. At the center of his fortune is a cancer treatment that costs more than a hundred times as much as another drug, available as a generic, that is prescribed for some of the same conditions.</p>\n<p>Soon-Shiong has been repeatedly accused of financial misrepresentation, self-dealing, price gouging, and fraud. He has been sued by former investors and business partners; he has been sued by other doctors; he has been sued by his own brother, twice; he has been sued by Cher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s not even get started on Elon Musk - the richest master-performer of self-cringe that ever lived - who is now acting as Trump&rsquo;s pet, literally (but awkwardly) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html\">jumping for joy</a>, or whatever the Musk form of that emotion may be, on a public stage during his campaigning. As it happens, in between occurrences of this &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/06/musk-i-m-dark-maga-am\">I&rsquo;m not just MAGA - I&rsquo;m dark Maga</a>&rdquo; buffoon upwardly prostrating his body into some form akin to a broken X-shape for Likes, he&rsquo;s also <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/elon-musk-2024-election-bribing-voters-trump.html\">quite possibly breaking voter bribery laws</a>.</p>\n<p>These people - each of whom has more access to power and resources than any human should ever have, and have vastly benefited from so many aspects of the very systems of governance that Trump threatens to derail - are each presumably somewhere on the scale between MAGA-pilled ideologue true believers and selfish, spiteful, cowards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/tech-ceos-trump-election-bezos-zuckerberg\">Casey Newton sums it up</a> well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is not, of course, a moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. There is no moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. Trump is an openly corrupt 78-year-old fascist, twice impeached and on 34 felony counts convicted, who attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power in 2021 and now promises to further undermine the democracy of the United States if he manages to assume power again.</p>\n<p>But a democratic emergency like the one we are now living through is not necessarily a business emergency. In the billionaires’ view, it could actually be an opportunity — to bring an end to the antitrust cases, to block further regulation of Big Tech in Congress, and to pursue their dreams of superintelligence in peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Rather, he is - can you guess? - a (bio)tech billionaire who in the past has been seen \"[palling around](https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/21/trump-soon-shiong/)\" with Donald Trump, begging him for a job. \n\nHe may be the [richest doctor in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/09/10/medicines-manhattan-project-can-the-worlds-richest-doctor-fix-health-care/#1421f5714c36), but is nonetheless a man so delusional that following one such dinner with the president-at-the=time he [publicly shared](https://x.com/DrPatSoonShiong/status/800457388801171456) that it was an:\n\n>Incredible honor dining w/Pres-elect [@realDonaldTrump](https://micro.blog/realDonaldTrump)  last night. He truly wants to advance healthcare for all.\n\n\"For all\". Hmm.\n\nThat said, the [New Yorker profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/01/how-patrick-soon-shiong-made-his-fortune-before-buying-the-la-times) of the good doctor makes it clear that he does have certain lifestyle similarities to Trump. For example, they've both been repeatedly taken to court over various violations.\n\n>“He gets very enthusiastic, and sometimes he might exaggerate,” Hentz said. “He can embellish a little.” Outcomes for his diabetes treatment were disappointing, and one case ended tragically.\n>\n>While pursuing this therapy, he also began researching chemotherapy. At the center of his fortune is a cancer treatment that costs more than a hundred times as much as another drug, available as a generic, that is prescribed for some of the same conditions. \n>\n>Soon-Shiong has been repeatedly accused of financial misrepresentation, self-dealing, price gouging, and fraud. He has been sued by former investors and business partners; he has been sued by other doctors; he has been sued by his own brother, twice; he has been sued by Cher.\n\nLet's not even get started on Elon Musk - the richest master-performer of self-cringe that ever lived - who is now acting as Trump's pet, literally (but awkwardly) [jumping for joy](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html), or whatever the Musk form of that emotion may be, on a public stage during his campaigning. As it happens, in between occurrences of this \"[I'm not just MAGA - I'm dark Maga](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/06/musk-i-m-dark-maga-am)\" buffoon upwardly prostrating his body into some form akin to a broken X-shape for Likes, he's also [quite possibly breaking voter bribery laws](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/elon-musk-2024-election-bribing-voters-trump.html).\n\nThese people - each of whom has more access to power and resources than any human should ever have, and have vastly benefited from so many aspects of the very systems of governance that Trump threatens to derail - are each presumably somewhere on the scale between MAGA-pilled ideologue true believers and selfish, spiteful, cowards. \n\n[Casey Newton sums it up](https://www.platformer.news/tech-ceos-trump-election-bezos-zuckerberg) well:\n\n>This is not, of course, a moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. There is no moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. Trump is an openly corrupt 78-year-old fascist, twice impeached and on 34 felony counts convicted, who attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power in 2021 and now promises to further undermine the democracy of the United States if he manages to assume power again.\n>\n>But a democratic emergency like the one we are now living through is not necessarily a business emergency. In the billionaires’ view, it could actually be an opportunity — to bring an end to the antitrust cases, to block further regulation of Big Tech in Congress, and to pursue their dreams of superintelligence in peace.\n",

There are 1,794 articles saved in my read-later app. There appear to be 2,241 episodes in my podcasts &ldquo;to listen to&rdquo; queue. The knowledge of hundreds of pending unread journal articles put me off ever even opening my collection of them to check.</p>\n<p>Then on the other side of the equation there&rsquo;s the collection of hundred of read items I want to blog about, and several half-written posts about a fraction of them.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat ashamed to say I even started a new RSS reader account on the basis that my collection of feeds felt somewhat unmanageable when all in one place.

				"content_text": "I have an information problem. There are 278 books on my \"Want to read list\". There are 1,794 articles saved in my read-later app. There appear to be 2,241 episodes in my podcasts \"to listen to\" queue. The knowledge of hundreds of pending unread journal articles put me off ever even opening my collection of them to check.\n\nThen on the other side of the equation there's the collection of hundred of read items I want to blog about, and several half-written posts about a fraction of them.\n\nI'm somewhat ashamed to say I even started a new RSS reader account on the basis that my collection of feeds felt somewhat unmanageable when all in one place. I guess I'm going to have to stop teasing my colleague for starting a new Google mail account because their previous one filled up.\n\nIt's absurd. I've only got one lifetime, as far as I know. And it's not like these numbers don't grow every single day.\n\nI know I'm not alone in this. [Nicholas Carr writes](https://www.newcartographies.com/p/haystacks-of-needles) about two forms of information overload, only one of which is solvable by the standard solution of improving the information filters, search and prioritisation algorithms that are available to us.\n\nOne can intuitively feel this to be true.

But who feels like they have *less* information overload now than in the past?\n\nIn Carr's view, that's because these filtering systems only solve \"situational overload\"\n\n>Situational overload is the needle-in-the-haystack problem: You need a particular piece of information — in order to answer a question of one sort or another — and that piece of information is buried in a bunch of other pieces of information.\n\nMany information-sorting technologies, from the introduction of indexes, catalogues and the Dewey Decimal system onwards, have made inroads into this.\n\nBut these systems don't help with \"ambient overload\".\n\n>Ambient overload doesn’t involve needles in haystacks.

In those cases I picked a single one based on either which title it seemed they were implicitly or explicitly sales-pitching the most in their talk, or if not applicable, then perhaps their most recent or, just the one that caught my eye. \n\n{{< bookshelf shelf=\"newscientistlive2024speakers\" variant=\"grid\" >}}\n",

				"title": "'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' explains why Big Tech does what it does, and why it's dangerous",
				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781610395700\">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had this book on my top priority reading list ever since it came out in 2018. It still somehow took me five years to get to it. But I&rsquo;m glad I did - I wasn&rsquo;t at all disappointed with my belated reading of it. I&rsquo;ve come away thinking that something along these lines should be essential reading for almost everyone who has to navigate today&rsquo;s technological society.</p>\n<p>This particular book is rather wordy and academic-sounding. Its style might not be accessible or interesting to everyone trying to make their way through today&rsquo;s chaotic and busy world. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for someone to bring out a shorter and simpler version. Or to communicate its message via a different media. The Netflix documentary on Facebook - &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/\">The Social Dilemma</a>&rdquo; - contained a small subset of similar ideas for instance and was surely a lot more accessible to a lot more people. But also, necessarily, that much shallower. This book is for anyone who is interested in digging deeper into what&rsquo;s happening, why, and why it matters.</p>\n<p>In any case, I feel that the ideas within this book very important to understand if you want to know what&rsquo;s being done to you and why, each time you use the internet. Or, for that matter, an increasing amount of the time when you aren&rsquo;t aware that you&rsquo;re anywhere near the internet.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I think you&rsquo;d get a decent summary from reading just the introduction if the full thing is too heavy going.</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, I&rsquo;ll note that the content plays heavily into my pre-existing biases as to the perils of big tech, particularly the mainstream social media companies. So perhaps some of my enthusiasm comes from the comfortable feeling one gets when reading something you already heavily agree with in many ways. But whilst one might fairly accuse it of over-hyping the current impact of surveillance capitalism I do think many of the basic ideas, the theories behind the system, are fairly indisputable and critical to document and publicise. It&rsquo;s important to know what the surveillance capitalists want to do to us and why - even if you don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re actually all that effective at doing it just yet. They&rsquo;re unlikely to get any <em>worse</em> at what they do over time, unless we intervene.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the general premise is that, as we know capitalism changes and adapts over time. The current version we&rsquo;re heavily enmeshed within can be described as the titular &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Living in an the era of surveillance capitalism, the digital realm has permeated very heavily into our lives. It has redefined how things work and what things are acceptable far faster than we&rsquo;ve had a chance to think about whether these changes are desirable or not. Famously, the big tech companies like to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/move-fast-break-things-facebook-motto/\">move fast and break things</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>This is of course a problem if the &ldquo;things&rdquo; they are breaking include you as an individual and society as a whole.  Without a swift re-evaluation and consequent serious action, Zuboff claims that our emerging &ldquo;information civilisation&rdquo; poses a substantial threat to some of our most fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>The mechanism by which this plays out can be swiftly summarised via this quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;our lives are unilaterally rendered as data, expropriated, and repurposed in new forms of social control, all of it in the service of others’ interests and in the absence of our awareness or means of combat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Digging deeper here - but not nearly as deep as the book does - the underlying philosophy starts with the claim by surveillance capitalists that they have the right to surveil and ingest our human experience in service of converting it into behavioural data.</p>\n<p>Some of this data might be used to improve the products they sell. This is perhaps fair enough, maybe even a net positive for us, and is how things <em>used</em> to work. But ever since Google discovered how profitable this data can be in the marketplace, the rest of our surveilled and datafied human experience is translated into a &ldquo;behavioural surplus&rdquo;, to be used exclusively in the interests of the company who snaffled it up in the first place.</p>\n<p>The companies concerned then use machine intelligence processes to manufacture a &ldquo;prediction product&rdquo; from our behavioural data. The prediction product aims, on the basis of knowing what you&rsquo;re doing, thinking or feeling right now, to be able to predict what you&rsquo;ll do in the future.</p>\n<p>These prediction products are traded in an entirely separate and new marketplace - the &ldquo;behavioural futures market&rdquo;. Selling this information about what we&rsquo;ve done, what we&rsquo;re doing and what we&rsquo;ll do in the future is extremely profitable for the companies that extracted it.</p>\n<p>The author reports that it was Google that first discovered the economic value in this. Soon afterwards Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and the rest of big tech followed. It&rsquo;s now become the default way that companies offering online services are funded now, everything from tiny start ups to mega corporations. Consequently, if we want to lead an effective life, we often have no reasonable alternative but to participate, to allow this to be done to us.</p>\n<p>The accuracy of the predictions the companies make about us is what makes them valuable. Increased accuracy means increased profits, for which the drive is, naturally under capitalism, insatiable. Thus these companies feel compelled to acquire and infer more and more data about us, which now includes our voices, our emotions and our personalities.</p>\n<p>Harrowing as that might be, it&rsquo;s not where the danger ends. There was a realisation that the most accurate predictive behavioural data is that which is created when the organisations concerned directly alter our behaviour. If they intervene, nudging us to make decisions in line with their interests, then their predictions become more accurate and hence more profitable. Think of how the fun Pokémon Go game ended up sending us to locations that just happened to correspond to restaurants that paid them or how Facebook expropriates a huge amount of data from us and our friends in order to allow its advertisers to more effectively influence us to buy their products.</p>\n<p>In doing this, these companies are exercising &ldquo;instrumentarian power&rdquo;; a power that knows and shapes human behaviour towards other people&rsquo;s goals. The end goal is effectively to automate us. Whilst an earlier time&rsquo;s industrial society was imagined as a well-functioning machine, instrumentarian society can be imagined as a human simulation of a machine learning system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instead of the typical assurances that machines can be designed to be more like human beings and therefore less threatening, Schmidt and Thrun argue just the opposite: it is necessary for people to become more machine-like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original digital dream - that being digitally connected is intrinsically pro-social, inclusive and tends towards the democratisation of knowledge is dead. Capitalism no longer feeds solely on human labour, but has expanded to feed on every aspect of the human experience.</p>\n<p>How was this allowed to happen? Basically because few people understood what was going on. &ldquo;Cyberspace&rdquo;, where it all began, was an uncharted and fairly lawless territory. Google et al. carried out deliberately secretive and misleading activities that were anyway so new, complex and illegible to the vast majority of us that even if we&rsquo;d somehow known what they were up to we wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have realised its implications.</p>\n<p>And all this was sold to us as a freedom, as an emancipation. Who <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> want free access to the entire world&rsquo;s information? Who doesn&rsquo;t desire to connect to their friends upon demand at the click of a button? Who would hate having the ability to publicise their thoughts, worries and concerns to the world at large? Who doesn&rsquo;t want a digital assistant or convenient online tools to help them get through the struggles and torments of modern life?</p>\n<p>At last, herald true personalisation is here to soothe us. Someone - well, something - that recognises us for who were are, acknowledges our interests, never says no, is always available.</p>\n<p>But, inevitably, behind the scenes, solving these issues is not the primary purpose that these products were created.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Surveillance capitalists quickly realized that they could do anything they wanted, and they did. They dressed in the fashions of advocacy and emancipation, appealing to and exploiting contemporary anxieties, while the real action was hidden offstage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To Facebook et al. we are not customers. There&rsquo;s no economic exchange, price or profit directly taking place between us and Google when we do a web search. Contra to a commonly held idea, we are not even the product. We are merely the source of the raw material that the surveillance capitalists need, the behavioural surplus. The real customers of these companies are the organisations that buy our data from them in the behavioural futures markets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;individuals are definitively cast as the means to others’ market ends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These techniques also came to the fore in an era of a neoliberal ideology that resisted the idea of putting controls on businesses. Furthermore, the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US also made the state and its population prioritise the benefits of surveillance over its drawbacks. After all, outside of specific examples like China, most governments often do not have the resources or skills to carry out mass sophisticated surveillance operations of the kind done by the private surveillance capitalists. Instead they&rsquo;re reliant on, and jealous of, big tech. The US government alternates its time between funding Google and begging for bits of their data.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous asymmetry in knowledge and power here. Surveillance capitalists know everything about us but deliberately use methods that mean we cannot know very much about them. Our rights to privacy are not respected. But they&rsquo;re not destroyed; just redistributed. Surveillance capitalism claims the right to privacy whilst depriving us of ours.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information.</p>\n<p>One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with the information concealed in its networks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The dynamics of power under industrial capitalism are shifted from past eras.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the twenty-first century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As are the fundamental risks to our very existence as we know it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and now threatens to cost us the Earth, an information civilization shaped by surveillance capitalism and its new instrumentarian power will thrive at the expense of human nature and will threaten to cost us our humanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not of course that surveillance capitalism doesn&rsquo;t <em>also</em> flourish at the expense of nature. The incredible power consumption of, for instance, modern day artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/\">makes that clear</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This “seventh extinction” will not be of nature but of what has been held most precious in human nature: the will to will, the sanctity of the individual, the ties of intimacy, the sociality that binds us together in promises, and the trust they breed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nothing about this was inevitable. The technology didn&rsquo;t create the system. The problem comes from the very logic of surveillance capitalism, which directs where the technology goes. The nefarious processes we&rsquo;re talking about were deliberately created to promote the commercial ends of the companies that foist them upon us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology can never be isolated from economics and society; they&rsquo;re always economic means to an end, not ends in themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise these attempts to surveil and automate us are not to be explained by individual &ldquo;bad people&rdquo; or a conspiracy. Firing Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mark-zuckerberg-cant-be-fired-as-meta-facebook-ceo-2022-11\">even if it wasn&rsquo;t impossible</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t fix the system. The actions taken by surveillance capitalists and the resulting harms are an obvious and inevitable consequence of the logic of accumulation under surveillance capitalism.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that US society was appalled at the idea of mass behaviour modification techniques. Admittedly they were generally envisaged as being carried out by the state. There haven&rsquo;t been an equivalent reaction in more modern times to the same practices being used by private companies who simply seek to get ever more rich, ever more powerful.</p>\n<p>This remains true, despite the intent of these companies to deprive us of various rights we previously claimed as inviolable. These include essentially any that require our individual autonomy and agency to be respected. Zuboff terms these as being challenges to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sanctity of the individual.</li>\n<li>the right to individual sovereignty.</li>\n<li>the right to the future tense.</li>\n<li>the right to sanctuary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The loss of these rights mean democracy is also under threat. Democratic engagement requires individuals to be able to exercise autonomous moral judgement and self-determination. If we lose the latter then we lose the former.</p>\n<p>There are at least 3 fundamental differences between surveillance capitalism and the capitalisms that came before.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Surveillance capitalists insist that they, and only they, should have unfettered freedom and knowledge. The theory of capitalism was built by its theorists on the back of 2 assumptions: firstly that markets are unknowable, and secondly that it&rsquo;s this unsurmountable ignorance that means market actors must be given freedom of action. This is Adam Smith&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand\">invisible hand</a> at play - the butcher cannot possibly know everything about every potential customer and their relationship to the market and society. But by having the freedom to work in their own interest they end up contributing, unknowingly, to the efficient allocation of resources; a positive result for society. This fundamental assumption breaks down as one side of any transaction - the Google side - gains ever more perfect knowledge but refuses to give up any of its freedoms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Traditionally capitalism has involved reciprocities. The author seems to me perhaps a little forgiving of prior power dynamics at times, although they mention the shareholder value movement as partly disrupting this. But it&rsquo;s true that ideas around reciprocation were fundamental to the origin of capitalism, such as Adam Smith&rsquo;s argument that price increases must be balanced with wage increases. However, today&rsquo;s hyperscale surveillance capitalists don&rsquo;t need or want to feel any obligation around reciprocities. As individuals, we are neither their customers, nor do they rely on very many of us as workers. These companies tend to have relatively small numbers of staff, all of which are drawn from very exclusive strata of population.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historically capitalism has been greatly in favour of an individualistic vision of the world, insisting on sanctity of individual liberties - often to a problematic level in my view. Traditional capitalism&rsquo;s vision of society is a set of individual agents freely transacting according to their will. In particular it loathed the idea of a collectivist society; one where planning and control is used to produce a result previously ordained by someone or something, which would necessarily come at the expense of an individual&rsquo;s freedom to do exactly as they choose. However, surveillance capitalism&rsquo;s desire is in fact for a collectivist society, one that they organise, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;radically indifferent&rdquo; to our own personal interests and predilections. It&rsquo;s a world where each of us is tuned and nudged to behave in line with previously ordained plans - plans that are solely in the interest of the surveillance capitalists.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The wealth of these companies means they can plough vast resources into recruiting the finest minds of our times and investing in infrastructure at levels that one would have thought would be more appropriate to efforts to solving world hunger and the in-progress environmental catastrophe. But no, in the real world, the most incredible rewards are given to the few people who have the privilege, education and ability to use of this data to make us&hellip;click on more adverts.</p>\n<p>So, for those of us who aren&rsquo;t keen on being surveilled and subconsciously coerced to do things we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have done, what can we do?</p>\n<p>Opting out seems the obvious thing at a glance. Don&rsquo;t use services that surveil and seek to modify your behaviour. However, in reality, that&rsquo;s nigh on impossible to do without dramatically affecting our lives. The internet is truly rife with this technology and using the internet is fairly critical for leading an effective life these days. And that&rsquo;s before we get to all the surveillance architecture that&rsquo;s hidden in physical public spaces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The prediction imperative transforms the things that we have into things that have us in order that it might render the range and richness of our world, our homes, and our bodies as behaving objects for its calculations and fabrications on the path to profit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was a time when you searched Google, but now Google searches you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This tension between a sense of knowing surveillance capitalism should be resisted but finding it almost impossible to do so if we want to have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life tends to result in us becoming cynical, resigned, and just learning to put up with it.</p>\n<p>We can of course attempt to hide. I myself use a wide range of tools that aim to preserve a certain degree of privacy on the internet - tracker blockers, ad blockers, VPNs, special browsers, encryption, all that kind of stuff. A <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/3201/ad-blocking/\">surprisingly high</a> (to me) number of people also take these precautions.</p>\n<p>There also exist physical items of relevance, such as clothes that aim to interfere with the ability of outdoor cameras to apply facial recognition to track where you go, what you do.</p>\n<p>But these whilst these solutions, or &ldquo;counter-declarations&rdquo; can help some individual people with their individual situations, they unfairly and impracticably put the onus to act on us as individuals. These efforts can sometimes can feel as exhausting to do as surveillance capitalism is to endure. Instead we need action at a society level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the individual alone cannot shoulder the burden of justice, any more than an individual worker in the first years of the twentieth century could bear the burden of fighting for fair wages and working conditions. Those twentieth-century challenges required collective action, and so do our own.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These actions would include changes in public opinion leading to legislation and jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s already been attempts to use monopoly or privacy legislation to address some of the harms. Whilst acknowledging that these are important facets of the issue, the author feels these efforts miss the primary point. The real harm here originates from the practice of the &ldquo;rendering of our lives as data&rdquo; in order to increase the control others have over us in the first place. What they argue for is legislation but far more widely scoped and interpreted. Something that&rsquo;s a much more fundamental challenge to what surveillance capitalists do.</p>\n<p>Zuboff refers to this as being a &lsquo;synthetic declaration&rsquo;, meaning something that imposes a new framework, redefining the facts of the matter, spelling out what we want our future to be.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://micro.blog/books/9781610395700) by Shoshana Zuboff.\r\n\r\nI've had this book on my top priority reading list ever since it came out in 2018. It still somehow took me five years to get to it. But I'm glad I did - I wasn't at all disappointed with my belated reading of it. I've come away thinking that something along these lines should be essential reading for almost everyone who has to navigate today's technological society.\r\n\r\nThis particular book is rather wordy and academic-sounding. Its style might not be accessible or interesting to everyone trying to make their way through today's chaotic and busy world. There's plenty of room for someone to bring out a shorter and simpler version. Or to communicate its message via a different media. The Netflix documentary on Facebook - \"[The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/)\" - contained a small subset of similar ideas for instance and was surely a lot more accessible to a lot more people. But also, necessarily, that much shallower. This book is for anyone who is interested in digging deeper into what's happening, why, and why it matters.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I feel that the ideas within this book very important to understand if you want to know what's being done to you and why, each time you use the internet. Or, for that matter, an increasing amount of the time when you aren't aware that you're anywhere near the internet. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I think you'd get a decent summary from reading just the introduction if the full thing is too heavy going.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, I'll note that the content plays heavily into my pre-existing biases as to the perils of big tech, particularly the mainstream social media companies. So perhaps some of my enthusiasm comes from the comfortable feeling one gets when reading something you already heavily agree with in many ways. But whilst one might fairly accuse it of over-hyping the current impact of surveillance capitalism I do think many of the basic ideas, the theories behind the system, are fairly indisputable and critical to document and publicise. It's important to know what the surveillance capitalists want to do to us and why - even if you don't believe they're actually all that effective at doing it just yet. They're unlikely to get any *worse* at what they do over time, unless we intervene.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the general premise is that, as we know capitalism changes and adapts over time. The current version we're heavily enmeshed within can be described as the titular \"surveillance capitalism\".\r\n\r\nLiving in an the era of surveillance capitalism, the digital realm has permeated very heavily into our lives. It has redefined how things work and what things are acceptable far faster than we've had a chance to think about whether these changes are desirable or not. Famously, the big tech companies like to \"[move fast and break things](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/move-fast-break-things-facebook-motto/)\".\r\n\r\nThis is of course a problem if the \"things\" they are breaking include you as an individual and society as a whole.  Without a swift re-evaluation and consequent serious action, Zuboff claims that our emerging \"information civilisation\" poses a substantial threat to some of our most fundamental rights.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which this plays out can be swiftly summarised via this quote:\r\n\r\n>...our lives are unilaterally rendered as data, expropriated, and repurposed in new forms of social control, all of it in the service of others’ interests and in the absence of our awareness or means of combat.\r\n\r\nDigging deeper here - but not nearly as deep as the book does - the underlying philosophy starts with the claim by surveillance capitalists that they have the right to surveil and ingest our human experience in service of converting it into behavioural data.\r\n\r\nSome of this data might be used to improve the products they sell. This is perhaps fair enough, maybe even a net positive for us, and is how things *used* to work. But ever since Google discovered how profitable this data can be in the marketplace, the rest of our surveilled and datafied human experience is translated into a \"behavioural surplus\", to be used exclusively in the interests of the company who snaffled it up in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe companies concerned then use machine intelligence processes to manufacture a \"prediction product\" from our behavioural data. The prediction product aims, on the basis of knowing what you're doing, thinking or feeling right now, to be able to predict what you'll do in the future.\r\n\r\nThese prediction products are traded in an entirely separate and new marketplace - the \"behavioural futures market\". Selling this information about what we've done, what we're doing and what we'll do in the future is extremely profitable for the companies that extracted it.\r\n\r\nThe author reports that it was Google that first discovered the economic value in this. Soon afterwards Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and the rest of big tech followed. It's now become the default way that companies offering online services are funded now, everything from tiny start ups to mega corporations. Consequently, if we want to lead an effective life, we often have no reasonable alternative but to participate, to allow this to be done to us.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the predictions the companies make about us is what makes them valuable. Increased accuracy means increased profits, for which the drive is, naturally under capitalism, insatiable. Thus these companies feel compelled to acquire and infer more and more data about us, which now includes our voices, our emotions and our personalities.\r\n\r\nHarrowing as that might be, it's not where the danger ends. There was a realisation that the most accurate predictive behavioural data is that which is created when the organisations concerned directly alter our behaviour. If they intervene, nudging us to make decisions in line with their interests, then their predictions become more accurate and hence more profitable. Think of how the fun Pokémon Go game ended up sending us to locations that just happened to correspond to restaurants that paid them or how Facebook expropriates a huge amount of data from us and our friends in order to allow its advertisers to more effectively influence us to buy their products.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, these companies are exercising \"instrumentarian power\"; a power that knows and shapes human behaviour towards other people's goals. The end goal is effectively to automate us. Whilst an earlier time's industrial society was imagined as a well-functioning machine, instrumentarian society can be imagined as a human simulation of a machine learning system.\r\n\r\n>Instead of the typical assurances that machines can be designed to be more like human beings and therefore less threatening, Schmidt and Thrun argue just the opposite: it is necessary for people to become more machine-like.\r\n\r\nThe original digital dream - that being digitally connected is intrinsically pro-social, inclusive and tends towards the democratisation of knowledge is dead. Capitalism no longer feeds solely on human labour, but has expanded to feed on every aspect of the human experience.\r\n\r\nHow was this allowed to happen? Basically because few people understood what was going on. \"Cyberspace\", where it all began, was an uncharted and fairly lawless territory. Google et al. carried out deliberately secretive and misleading activities that were anyway so new, complex and illegible to the vast majority of us that even if we'd somehow known what they were up to we wouldn't necessarily have realised its implications.\r\n\r\nAnd all this was sold to us as a freedom, as an emancipation. Who *wouldn't* want free access to the entire world's information? Who doesn't desire to connect to their friends upon demand at the click of a button? Who would hate having the ability to publicise their thoughts, worries and concerns to the world at large? Who doesn't want a digital assistant or convenient online tools to help them get through the struggles and torments of modern life? \r\n\r\nAt last, herald true personalisation is here to soothe us. Someone - well, something - that recognises us for who were are, acknowledges our interests, never says no, is always available. \r\n\r\nBut, inevitably, behind the scenes, solving these issues is not the primary purpose that these products were created.\r\n\r\n>Surveillance capitalists quickly realized that they could do anything they wanted, and they did. They dressed in the fashions of advocacy and emancipation, appealing to and exploiting contemporary anxieties, while the real action was hidden offstage.\r\n\r\nTo Facebook et al. we are not customers. There's no economic exchange, price or profit directly taking place between us and Google when we do a web search. Contra to a commonly held idea, we are not even the product. We are merely the source of the raw material that the surveillance capitalists need, the behavioural surplus. The real customers of these companies are the organisations that buy our data from them in the behavioural futures markets.\r\n\r\n> ...individuals are definitively cast as the means to others’ market ends.\r\n\r\nThese techniques also came to the fore in an era of a neoliberal ideology that resisted the idea of putting controls on businesses. Furthermore, the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US also made the state and its population prioritise the benefits of surveillance over its drawbacks. After all, outside of specific examples like China, most governments often do not have the resources or skills to carry out mass sophisticated surveillance operations of the kind done by the private surveillance capitalists. Instead they're reliant on, and jealous of, big tech. The US government alternates its time between funding Google and begging for bits of their data. \r\n\r\nThere's a tremendous asymmetry in knowledge and power here. Surveillance capitalists know everything about us but deliberately use methods that mean we cannot know very much about them. Our rights to privacy are not respected. But they're not destroyed; just redistributed. Surveillance capitalism claims the right to privacy whilst depriving us of ours.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day:\r\n\r\n> Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information.\r\n> \r\n> One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with the information concealed in its networks.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of power under industrial capitalism are shifted from past eras.\r\n\r\n>...ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nAs are the fundamental risks to our very existence as we know it:\r\n\r\n>Just as industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and now threatens to cost us the Earth, an information civilization shaped by surveillance capitalism and its new instrumentarian power will thrive at the expense of human nature and will threaten to cost us our humanity. \r\n\r\nNot of course that surveillance capitalism doesn't *also* flourish at the expense of nature. The incredible power consumption of, for instance, modern day artificial intelligence [makes that clear](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/).\r\n\r\n>This “seventh extinction” will not be of nature but of what has been held most precious in human nature: the will to will, the sanctity of the individual, the ties of intimacy, the sociality that binds us together in promises, and the trust they breed. \r\n\r\nNothing about this was inevitable. The technology didn't create the system. The problem comes from the very logic of surveillance capitalism, which directs where the technology goes. The nefarious processes we're talking about were deliberately created to promote the commercial ends of the companies that foist them upon us.\r\n\r\n>Technology can never be isolated from economics and society; they're always economic means to an end, not ends in themselves.\r\n\r\nLikewise these attempts to surveil and automate us are not to be explained by individual \"bad people\" or a conspiracy. Firing Zuckerberg, [even if it wasn't impossible](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mark-zuckerberg-cant-be-fired-as-meta-facebook-ceo-2022-11), wouldn't fix the system. The actions taken by surveillance capitalists and the resulting harms are an obvious and inevitable consequence of the logic of accumulation under surveillance capitalism.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't so long ago that US society was appalled at the idea of mass behaviour modification techniques. Admittedly they were generally envisaged as being carried out by the state. There haven't been an equivalent reaction in more modern times to the same practices being used by private companies who simply seek to get ever more rich, ever more powerful. \r\n\r\nThis remains true, despite the intent of these companies to deprive us of various rights we previously claimed as inviolable. These include essentially any that require our individual autonomy and agency to be respected. Zuboff terms these as being challenges to:\r\n\r\n- the sanctity of the individual.\r\n- the right to individual sovereignty.\r\n- the right to the future tense.\r\n- the right to sanctuary. \r\n\r\nThe loss of these rights mean democracy is also under threat. Democratic engagement requires individuals to be able to exercise autonomous moral judgement and self-determination. If we lose the latter then we lose the former.\r\n\r\nThere are at least 3 fundamental differences between surveillance capitalism and the capitalisms that came before.\r\n\r\n1. Surveillance capitalists insist that they, and only they, should have unfettered freedom and knowledge. The theory of capitalism was built by its theorists on the back of 2 assumptions: firstly that markets are unknowable, and secondly that it's this unsurmountable ignorance that means market actors must be given freedom of action. This is Adam Smith's [invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) at play - the butcher cannot possibly know everything about every potential customer and their relationship to the market and society. But by having the freedom to work in their own interest they end up contributing, unknowingly, to the efficient allocation of resources; a positive result for society. This fundamental assumption breaks down as one side of any transaction - the Google side - gains ever more perfect knowledge but refuses to give up any of its freedoms.\r\n   \r\n2. Traditionally capitalism has involved reciprocities. The author seems to me perhaps a little forgiving of prior power dynamics at times, although they mention the shareholder value movement as partly disrupting this. But it's true that ideas around reciprocation were fundamental to the origin of capitalism, such as Adam Smith's argument that price increases must be balanced with wage increases. However, today's hyperscale surveillance capitalists don't need or want to feel any obligation around reciprocities. As individuals, we are neither their customers, nor do they rely on very many of us as workers. These companies tend to have relatively small numbers of staff, all of which are drawn from very exclusive strata of population. \r\n   \r\n4. Historically capitalism has been greatly in favour of an individualistic vision of the world, insisting on sanctity of individual liberties - often to a problematic level in my view. Traditional capitalism's vision of society is a set of individual agents freely transacting according to their will. In particular it loathed the idea of a collectivist society; one where planning and control is used to produce a result previously ordained by someone or something, which would necessarily come at the expense of an individual's freedom to do exactly as they choose. However, surveillance capitalism's desire is in fact for a collectivist society, one that they organise, that's \"radically indifferent\" to our own personal interests and predilections. It's a world where each of us is tuned and nudged to behave in line with previously ordained plans - plans that are solely in the interest of the surveillance capitalists. \r\n \r\nThe wealth of these companies means they can plough vast resources into recruiting the finest minds of our times and investing in infrastructure at levels that one would have thought would be more appropriate to efforts to solving world hunger and the in-progress environmental catastrophe. But no, in the real world, the most incredible rewards are given to the few people who have the privilege, education and ability to use of this data to make us...click on more adverts.\r\n\r\nSo, for those of us who aren't keen on being surveilled and subconsciously coerced to do things we otherwise wouldn't have done, what can we do?\r\n\r\nOpting out seems the obvious thing at a glance. Don't use services that surveil and seek to modify your behaviour. However, in reality, that's nigh on impossible to do without dramatically affecting our lives. The internet is truly rife with this technology and using the internet is fairly critical for leading an effective life these days. And that's before we get to all the surveillance architecture that's hidden in physical public spaces.\r\n\r\n>The prediction imperative transforms the things that we have into things that have us in order that it might render the range and richness of our world, our homes, and our bodies as behaving objects for its calculations and fabrications on the path to profit.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n>There was a time when you searched Google, but now Google searches you. \r\n\r\nThis tension between a sense of knowing surveillance capitalism should be resisted but finding it almost impossible to do so if we want to have a \"normal\" life tends to result in us becoming cynical, resigned, and just learning to put up with it.\r\n\r\nWe can of course attempt to hide. I myself use a wide range of tools that aim to preserve a certain degree of privacy on the internet - tracker blockers, ad blockers, VPNs, special browsers, encryption, all that kind of stuff. A [surprisingly high](https://www.statista.com/topics/3201/ad-blocking/) (to me) number of people also take these precautions.\r\n\r\nThere also exist physical items of relevance, such as clothes that aim to interfere with the ability of outdoor cameras to apply facial recognition to track where you go, what you do.\r\n\r\nBut these whilst these solutions, or \"counter-declarations\" can help some individual people with their individual situations, they unfairly and impracticably put the onus to act on us as individuals. These efforts can sometimes can feel as exhausting to do as surveillance capitalism is to endure. Instead we need action at a society level.\r\n\r\n> ...the individual alone cannot shoulder the burden of justice, any more than an individual worker in the first years of the twentieth century could bear the burden of fighting for fair wages and working conditions. Those twentieth-century challenges required collective action, and so do our own.\r\n\r\nThese actions would include changes in public opinion leading to legislation and jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThere's already been attempts to use monopoly or privacy legislation to address some of the harms. Whilst acknowledging that these are important facets of the issue, the author feels these efforts miss the primary point. The real harm here originates from the practice of the \"rendering of our lives as data\" in order to increase the control others have over us in the first place. What they argue for is legislation but far more widely scoped and interpreted. Something that's a much more fundamental challenge to what surveillance capitalists do.\r\n\r\nZuboff refers to this as being a 'synthetic declaration', meaning something that imposes a new framework, redefining the facts of the matter, spelling out what we want our future to be. Likely components would include:\r\n\r\n- strengthening our democratic institutions.\r\n- constructing a [double movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_movement).\r\n- harnessing digital technologies in ways that help us to live an effective life and maintain a democratic social order.\r\n\r\n[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) might one day be seen as green shoots to move in this direction with its requirement that companies justify their data activities. But at the time of the book being written it remained to be seen what its real impact would be. Notably, Zuboff argues that this would be dependent how it's interpreted by society and the law, which is more important than the specific text of the legislation.\r\n\r\nNow it's been place for a few years and, hey, surveillance capitalism still does what it does, flourishing to an astonishing degree, albeit with slightly reduced rights (that it's battling to regain) [in Europe](https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/meta-faces-new-limits-on-ad-targeting-court-of-justice-cjeu-schrems/).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Zuboff concludes that:\r\n\r\n>It is not OK to have to hide in your own life; it is not normal.\r\n>...\r\n> It is not OK for every move, emotion, utterance, and desire to be catalogued, manipulated, and then used to surreptitiously herd us through the future tense for the sake of someone else’s profit\r\n...\r\n>\r\n>...it is up to us to use our knowledge, to regain our bearings, to stir others to do the same, and to found a new beginning\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/sc.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"612\" alt=\"Book cover for The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\">\n",

Musk claimed that the judge who made this demand was making &ldquo;illegal orders to censor his political opponents&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/06/elon-musk-free-speech-twitter-will-treat-cisgender-slur\">self-proclaimed &ldquo;free-speech-absolutist&rdquo;</a> Musk presumably decided personal wealth was more important than his claimed &ldquo;principles&rdquo;, or someone over at X has managed to make him to so - or maybe he just woke up in a different mood.

Oh and you&rsquo;re not supposed to use the words &ldquo;cis&rdquo; or &ldquo;cisgender&rdquo; on his platform.</p>\n<p>And neither has X under his leadership been sanctuary for all content, untouched by moderator hand.

				"title": "Recent research provides some (weak) evidence that labelling menu items with calories might cause harm to some",
				"content_html": "<p>Something I feel myself gradually changing my mind on is the ubiquitous labelling of how many calories each food contains on restaurant menus.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1893542\">basic idea</a> there is that if consumers see that some restaurant food choices options have a very large amount of calories in them then they might be less likely to pick them and, as such, consume fewer calories. This would add up so in the long term they&rsquo;d be less likely put on excess weight with all the concomitant difficulties and <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks\">associated conditions</a> which that can entail for some.</p>\n<p>There might also be some side-effect benefits too, such as restaurants or food producers providing less calorific meals because they don&rsquo;t want to have a menu full of dishes that exceed the average person&rsquo;s recommended calorie intake in one ago.</p>\n<p>I never felt there was much likelihood that the labelling initiative would actually have a big effect on behaviour, let alone health. It always seemed a bit &ldquo;this seems like common sense so let&rsquo;s assume it works&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;we have evidence it works so let&rsquo;s do it&rdquo;. Intuition over evidence; something that unfortunately rife and occasionally dangerous in the world of weight loss amongst others.</p>\n<p>Another potential defect came from its seeming centring of the issue of overweight and obesity on the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/eclinm/PIIS2589-5370(22)00138-9.pdf\">incorrect</a>,  <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/weight-stigma-is-a-burden-around-the-world-and-has-negative-consequences-everywhere-155215\">stigmatising</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z\">counterproductive</a> idea that the large increase in the proportion of people living at higher weights reveals something about the people concerned being ignorant or making &ldquo;bad&rdquo; choices; as though in recent years some evil wizard cast a magical spell over us all that made most of us into foolish greedy gluttons.</p>\n<p>This way of thinking is harmful nonsense. It also puts all the &ldquo;blame&rdquo;, for want of a better word, on us as individuals and lets us ignore the structural factors - the things that are harder to think about, more complicated to act on and often less favourable to the profits of associated  businesses - that are so clearly at play.</p>\n<p>Since then <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/10/1088\">most of the research</a> I&rsquo;ve seen about the various labelling initiatives seems to have confirmed that indeed we&rsquo;re not going to reduce the rate of obesity meaningfully by making it clear how many calories a Big Mac has at the point of sale. It may even be a entirely ineffectual intervention in terms of clinical significance in the long term.</p>\n<p>But, my scepticism on its likely efficacy aside, I saw no significant harm in trying it out as a policy - plus have a personal bias towards always wanting more information, more data, to be made available. It felt like it may even have shifted my own eating behaviour a tiny amount.</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m privileged enough that I&rsquo;m not someone the policy was ever likely to harm. However, critically, those people may well exist.  And if so, well, calorie labelling <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/calorie-labelling-on-menus-to-be-introduced-in-cafes-restaurants-and-takeaways\">is now mandatory in the UK</a>,  a policy that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3\">most of the population</a> seems to have been in favour of, so it&rsquo;s a potential concern we should look to mitigate.</p>\n<p>The evidence on the harms side is scant so far to be fair, so caveat emptor, but there are hints of adverse effects showing up in some recent research.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3\">recent paper by Brealey et al</a> reviewed some of the literature on the impact of food labelling on people that have eating disorders (ED).</p>\n<p>They found four studies - listed and summarised as part of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3/tables/1\">this table</a> - that use qualitative methods to end up suggesting some potential for harm.</p>\n<p>The researchers summarise the results as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recurrent themes describe how calories on menus: can lead to a hyper-fixation on calories, restrict food freedom (meals are chosen for their calorific value rather than what was actually wanted or appropriate for hunger levels), reduce eating out opportunities, increase feelings of anxiety, guilt and shame around food choices, and inhibit ED recovery.</p>\n<p>Some participants in these studies expressed anger over the messaging from ‘trusted’ public health authorities on the normalisation of calorie counting, because calorie counting had played a pivotal role in the development of their ED</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, the feelings on labelling weren&rsquo;t all negative for the participants concerned. Some saw benefits. Many of them also felt that calorie labelling may overall be a net good thing even if it might put them themselves at risk.</p>\n<p>The researchers found only <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350615001201?via%3Dihub\">a single study</a> that looked at more objective changes to the symptoms of eating disorders themselves, carried out in a university café.

				"content_text": "Something I feel myself gradually changing my mind on is the ubiquitous labelling of how many calories each food contains on restaurant menus.\n\nThe [basic idea](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1893542) there is that if consumers see that some restaurant food choices options have a very large amount of calories in them then they might be less likely to pick them and, as such, consume fewer calories. This would add up so in the long term they'd be less likely put on excess weight with all the concomitant difficulties and [associated conditions](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks) which that can entail for some. \n\nThere might also be some side-effect benefits too, such as restaurants or food producers providing less calorific meals because they don't want to have a menu full of dishes that exceed the average person's recommended calorie intake in one ago.\n\nI never felt there was much likelihood that the labelling initiative would actually have a big effect on behaviour, let alone health. It always seemed a bit \"this seems like common sense so let's assume it works\" rather than \"we have evidence it works so let's do it\". Intuition over evidence; something that unfortunately rife and occasionally dangerous in the world of weight loss amongst others. \n\nAnother potential defect came from its seeming centring of the issue of overweight and obesity on the [incorrect](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/eclinm/PIIS2589-5370(22)00138-9.pdf),  [stigmatising](https://theconversation.com/weight-stigma-is-a-burden-around-the-world-and-has-negative-consequences-everywhere-155215) and [counterproductive](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z) idea that the large increase in the proportion of people living at higher weights reveals something about the people concerned being ignorant or making \"bad\" choices; as though in recent years some evil wizard cast a magical spell over us all that made most of us into foolish greedy gluttons. \n\nThis way of thinking is harmful nonsense. It also puts all the \"blame\", for want of a better word, on us as individuals and lets us ignore the structural factors - the things that are harder to think about, more complicated to act on and often less favourable to the profits of associated  businesses - that are so clearly at play.\n\nSince then [most of the research](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/10/1088) I've seen about the various labelling initiatives seems to have confirmed that indeed we're not going to reduce the rate of obesity meaningfully by making it clear how many calories a Big Mac has at the point of sale. It may even be a entirely ineffectual intervention in terms of clinical significance in the long term. \n\nBut, my scepticism on its likely efficacy aside, I saw no significant harm in trying it out as a policy - plus have a personal bias towards always wanting more information, more data, to be made available. It felt like it may even have shifted my own eating behaviour a tiny amount.\n\nBut I'm privileged enough that I'm not someone the policy was ever likely to harm. However, critically, those people may well exist.  And if so, well, calorie labelling [is now mandatory in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/calorie-labelling-on-menus-to-be-introduced-in-cafes-restaurants-and-takeaways),  a policy that [most of the population](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3) seems to have been in favour of, so it's a potential concern we should look to mitigate.\n\nThe evidence on the harms side is scant so far to be fair, so caveat emptor, but there are hints of adverse effects showing up in some recent research.\n\nA [recent paper by Brealey et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3) reviewed some of the literature on the impact of food labelling on people that have eating disorders (ED).\n\nThey found four studies - listed and summarised as part of [this table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3/tables/1) - that use qualitative methods to end up suggesting some potential for harm.\n\nThe researchers summarise the results as:\n\n>Recurrent themes describe how calories on menus: can lead to a hyper-fixation on calories, restrict food freedom (meals are chosen for their calorific value rather than what was actually wanted or appropriate for hunger levels), reduce eating out opportunities, increase feelings of anxiety, guilt and shame around food choices, and inhibit ED recovery.\n>\n>Some participants in these studies expressed anger over the messaging from ‘trusted’ public health authorities on the normalisation of calorie counting, because calorie counting had played a pivotal role in the development of their ED\n\nTo be clear, the feelings on labelling weren't all negative for the participants concerned. Some saw benefits. Many of them also felt that calorie labelling may overall be a net good thing even if it might put them themselves at risk.\n\nThe researchers found only [a single study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350615001201?via%3Dihub) that looked at more objective changes to the symptoms of eating disorders themselves, carried out in a university café. That work found no significant effects of labelling on some symptoms associated with eating disorder, but also came with a large number of limitations - not least that the participants hadn't been formally diagnosed as having a ED.\n\nSo honestly the evidence base for harms also seems pretty weak at present. There's simply not enough research out there to form much of a strong conclusion. And almost none that looks at objective rather than subjective harm in terms of ED symptoms - not to suggest that any types of harm should be disregarded. \n\nBut on the other hand, given the dearth of evidence that labelling actually leads to much of a relevant change in peoples' behaviour, let alone any positive change in their health, the risk equation shifts someway in the anti-labelling direction when any evidence, even if it's weak, for the potential for harm comes to light.\n\nWithout wanting to be a cliché, this is one are where \"more research is needed\".\n",

				"content_text": "More events in what is starting to feel something like a global backlash against some of the big social media companies. \r\n\r\nWe've previously seen [the arrest of Telegram's founder](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/01/telegram-is-only.html), Pavel Durov. Now, elsewhere, [Brazil has totally banned the use of Twitter](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/30/elon-musk-x-could-face-ban-in-brazil-after-failure-to-appoint-legal-representative) (OK, \"X\") for anyone who lives there. on the basis that they're refusing to appoint a legal representative in Brazil. This is something all foreign companies that operate in Brazil are required to do.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I know far too little about the situation to judge the rights and wrongs of the ban. Or for that matter its enforceability. Although, at least in theory, X is to be cut off at the ISP level, and hefty fines await any Brazilian users who use VPNs to evade the ban.\r\n\r\nIt might be noted that this follows Elon Musk, owner of X, becoming upset one of Brazil's judges asked him to suspend the accounts of users he claimed were spreading disinformation. Elon is of course not known for maintaining his cool when someone does anything other than agree wholeheartedly with him. X is [now claiming](https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281) that the Brazillian judge was making \"illegal orders to censor his political opponents.\".\r\n\r\nWhatever the ins and outs of the situation, it seems a good amount of Brazil's ex-X users aren't all that disheartened by the news, or at least not to disheartened they can't muster the energy to post through it. They just went somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThese events have apparently caused [a huge wave](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232561/brazil-x-ban-sending-people-bluesky) of signups to X-rival [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) - setting an [all-time-high record](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/bluesky-tops-app-charts-and-sees-all-time-highs-after-brazil-bans-x/) for activity on that platform, plus a substantially lower but above zero number to Mastodon.\r\n\r\nFrom the [recent reporting](https://fediversereport.com/last-week-in-fediverse-ep-82/) by \"[Last Week in Fediverse](https://fediversereport.com/)\", it sounds the Brazillian users have also made Bluesky a lot more of a fun place to be.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I haven&rsquo;t looked into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/26/telegram-founder-suspected-allowing-criminal-activity-pavel-durov-prosecutors\">the arrest</a> of message-app <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\">Telegram&rsquo;s</a> founder Pavel Durov enough to form an opinion, but one thing I did learn from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/27/what-does-the-telegram-founders-arrest-mean-for-the-regulation-of-social-media-companies-pavel-durov?CMP=techtonic_email\"> a recent Guardian newsletter on the subject</a> was that Telegram is a lot less private and secure than I&rsquo;d imagined.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d imagined it as an alternative to fully encrypted messaging services like <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a> that I just hadn&rsquo;t had any reason to use much so far. But despite its home page promoting it as being privacy oriented - &ldquo;Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct&rdquo;, in reality the service is not end-to-end encrypted for the most part.</p>\n<p>Whilst all messages are &ldquo;basic-encrypted&rdquo; such that your internet provider or anyone intercepting communications between your phone and your Wifi router <a href=\"https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-telegram-protect-me-against-everything\">couldn&rsquo;t read them</a>, only DMs sent via the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats\">secret chats</a>&rdquo; feature - an opt-in feature that you have to discover and enable yourself - are end-to-end encrypted. Everything outside of that, including all messages in group chats and broadcast channels, is not end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>A lack of end-to-end encryption means that in theory anyone with the correct access - legitimately acquired or not -  to Telegram&rsquo;s systems could in theory read your messages. In addition, Telegram would be able to hand your correspondence over to any authority that requests them.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/security-technology/encryption.cfm\">ongoing debate</a> as to whether this is a net good or net bad thing of course. But if you came to Telegram for its privacy, well, you have to go to some effort and also stop yourself using most of its features if you want to be absolutely certain that no-one other than your intended recipient can read your message.</p>\n<p>All in all, if you want truly private messaging that not even the service&rsquo;s CEO - or a hacker using their account - could see, then from an encryption point of view it turns off you&rsquo;re likely better off using <a href=\"https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private\">Signal</a> or even, believe it or not, Meta&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543\">WhatsApp</a> (! A cynic might say that this is a sign that it wasn&rsquo;t Meta that invented WhatsApp, they just bought it).

				"content_text": "I haven't looked into [the arrest](https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/26/telegram-founder-suspected-allowing-criminal-activity-pavel-durov-prosecutors) of message-app [Telegram's](https://telegram.org/) founder Pavel Durov enough to form an opinion, but one thing I did learn from[ a recent Guardian newsletter on the subject](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/27/what-does-the-telegram-founders-arrest-mean-for-the-regulation-of-social-media-companies-pavel-durov?CMP=techtonic_email) was that Telegram is a lot less private and secure than I'd imagined.\n\nI'd imagined it as an alternative to fully encrypted messaging services like [Signal](https://signal.org/) that I just hadn't had any reason to use much so far. But despite its home page promoting it as being privacy oriented - \"Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct\", in reality the service is not end-to-end encrypted for the most part.\n\nWhilst all messages are \"basic-encrypted\" such that your internet provider or anyone intercepting communications between your phone and your Wifi router [couldn't read them](https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-telegram-protect-me-against-everything), only DMs sent via the \"[secret chats](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats)\" feature - an opt-in feature that you have to discover and enable yourself - are end-to-end encrypted. Everything outside of that, including all messages in group chats and broadcast channels, is not end-to-end encrypted.\n\nA lack of end-to-end encryption means that in theory anyone with the correct access - legitimately acquired or not -  to Telegram's systems could in theory read your messages. In addition, Telegram would be able to hand your correspondence over to any authority that requests them. \n\nIt's an [ongoing debate](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/security-technology/encryption.cfm) as to whether this is a net good or net bad thing of course. But if you came to Telegram for its privacy, well, you have to go to some effort and also stop yourself using most of its features if you want to be absolutely certain that no-one other than your intended recipient can read your message.\n\nAll in all, if you want truly private messaging that not even the service's CEO - or a hacker using their account - could see, then from an encryption point of view it turns off you're likely better off using [Signal](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private) or even, believe it or not, Meta's [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543) (! A cynic might say that this is a sign that it wasn't Meta that invented WhatsApp, they just bought it). Both Signal and WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default.\n\nThat's not to say even those two services know *nothing* about you. It just means they don't know the content of your messages, which is often people's first concern - even though metadata can on occasion give away rather more information about you that you might expect. \n\nSignal makes [a big deal](https://signal.org/bigbrother/santaclara/) about how little it stores even on the metadata front. They basically know when your account was created and when it was last used, so that's all they can give to the authorities when legally compelled to do so. WhatsApp on the other hand [may apparently know](https://archive.is/H4cW6) when and where you were when you used the app, the names of your group chats, and has the ability to record which phone numbers your number chats too if legally required to do so.\n\niMessage or Google's message apps are also apparently contenders for end-to-end encryption fans but only [if you're absolutely sure that everyone you talk to is using the same type of phone](https://archive.is/H4cW6) and same chat app. Any convo that involves an iMessage green bubbler for instance isn't end-to-end encrypted.

For all the right-wing concern about some loony left shadowy elites trying to control the world and generally being up to no good, I think it&rsquo;s a few of the mega rich and powerful folk who are clearly on the right - even if they occasionally decide they&rsquo;re godlike being who operate at levels above such pathetic human ideologies - we might worry about in the immediate term.</p>\n<p>A few months ago the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In April, Musk co-hosted a secret dinner of around a dozen business leaders in Los Angeles. The guests included Peltz; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, chairman emeritus of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This took place at David Sacks' massive house. Sacks and Musk worked together back in the early days of Paypal.

A few government types, including Steven Mnuchin, scored invites. There were also some less politically active titans of industry, such as Uber co-founder and former C.E.O. Travis Kalanick</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why are all these distasteful people taking the time to go party at each other&rsquo;s houses? Basically in the service of political corruption via wealth.</p>\n<p>Back to the WSJ&rsquo;s reporting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The discussion at times centered on how attendees could give money to Trump outside of public view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, how best to funnel huge amounts of money into defeating the Democrats as a whole, given even America has <em>some</em> limits on this kind of thing. Plus, believe it or not, there was a time that giving millionaires to a uniquely unsuitable and unstable presidential candidate out of at best sheer personal greed, was something a few of even this posse might feel some shame about.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the gatherings spread. Real <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_Smoking_Man\">X-Files smoking man</a> stuff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Peltz and Musk also told Trump of an influence campaign in elite circles that is already under way, in which Musk and his political allies host gatherings of powerful business leaders across the country to try to convince them not to support President Biden’s re-election campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst Puck&rsquo;s reporting suggested that the gathering they wrote about was supposedly more anti-Democrat than pro-Trump as a person, we do now know that some of those folk are very invested in supporting Trump as a person; in fact as the most qualified person in the whole of the US to exercise increasingly absolute power over its citizenry.</p>\n<p>In more recent times, particularly since the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump\">assassination attempt</a> on their preferred leader, Donald Trump, the whole shadowy billionaires having secret meetings about corrupting the political process in favour of Trump with their vast wealth has become less of an amateur secret conspiracy and more a very public stating of preferences and pumping of vast sums of money in order to try and buy the election result that they want, alongside currying favour with the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/donald-trumps-consistent-unreliability-on-covid-and-everything-else\">famously unreliable</a> but perfectly able-to-be-bribed potential future president that they believe can make all their unhinged dreams come true.</p>\n<p>David Sacks went from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-murdoch-biden-dinner-b2538718.html\">saying in 2021</a> that Trump had &ldquo;disqualified himself from being a candidate at the national level again&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/business/dealbook/silicon-valley-trump.html\">a public endorsement in 2024</a>. Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen are amongst other public supporters and money shovellers.</p>\n<p>Musk is one of the larger donors, having recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823\">pledged to donate $45 million <em>a month</em></a> to a pro-Trump <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee#Super_PACs\">Super PAC</a> (for the non-Americans amongst us, the relevance of a Super PAC here as far as I understand it is that it&rsquo;s a workaround so very rich people can give way more money to political campaigns than they would technically be allowed to directly). The same PAC is receiving hefty donations from Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale and the Winklevoss twins, who it turns out are now heavily into cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>So what does one get for $45 million? Well, outside of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3\">a formal role in Trump&rsquo;s government</a>, it seems that you probably get to choose who the US Vice President is going to be. Unless it was a perfect coincidence that the day after Musk committed that money <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-vice-president-vance-rubio-burgum-rnc-6cc438a8370a21b2631f5a53b06b71d0\">Trump announced</a> that his pick was the multi-millionaire JD Vance, who happens to be someone these weird tech billionaires really like.</p>\n<p>Despite being famous in the past for having written a book about the travails of being a poor White man in his memoir, which somehow I still haven&rsquo;t read - <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780062872258?title=Hillbilly+Elegy&amp;author=J.+D.+Vance&amp;cover_id=172665\">Hillbilly Elegy</a> - Vance actually spent many of his earlier years <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/trumps-vp-candidate-j-d-vance-has-long-ties-to-silicon-valley-and-was-a-vc-himself/?ref=404media.co\">working as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist</a> under the afore-mentioned arch-libertarian Peter Thiel.</p>\n<p>In fact the illogically wealthy tech bros like JD Vance so much that mere hours after Trump named him as his VP pick we saw some more of those kind of VCs,  Marc Andreessen - someone who has convinced himself that regulating artificial intelligence is <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually-actually-guy\">Ackchyually</a> &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.404media.co/marc-andreesen-manifesto-says-ai-regulation-is-a-form-of-murder\">a form of murder</a>&rdquo;, - and his company&rsquo;s cofounder Ben Horowitz, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNclEgQZQ\">publicly express</a> their support for this dangerous fool.</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, substantial motivation for this comes from Trumps likelihood of not getting in the way of whatever the latest cryptocurrency scam they want to run is.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://americanprospect.bluelena.io/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=fa2e8c4385712f9a1d24c363a2cbe5b8.2813&amp;s=e2a6bd41e301af690d8980c64caa4683\">The American Prospect writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;to Musk and Thiel and a growing number of the Valley’s biggest players, any infringement on capitalists’ sovereignty is anathema</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JD Vance very much sups from the same cup.</p>\n<p>And it certainly seems to be buying them the outcome they want. See for example the extremely bizarre section of the <a href=\"https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf\">Republican&rsquo;s 2024 platform</a> whereby they decry any attempts to limit the grift-filled world of cryptocurrency or any attempt to stop AI Hitlers coming to the fore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto\ncrackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency.</p>\n<p>We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the\nright to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from\nGovernment Surveillance and Control.\n&hellip;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will repeal Joe Biden’s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI\nInnovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this\ntechnology.</p>\n<p>Sure. it&rsquo;s written in the style of a particularly unhinged kidnapper sending a ransom note, and maybe the founding fathers didn&rsquo;t <em>technically</em> list the right to <a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/03/cryptocurrency-explained\">solving sudokus whilst the world burns</a> as a fundamental human right as such, but I&rsquo;m sure they would have if they weren&rsquo;t busy with other stuff.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/email/ae79d8cc-a24b-44dc-81d6-f156b12cdbf4\">404 Media notes</a> that of course there&rsquo;s not really any shortage of uncontrolled AI bunkum flying around the world under Biden&rsquo;s administration. Rather:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;Vance and Trump are not uniquely qualified to support the development of AI. They are simply the Republican nominees, and people at the head of AI companies and venture capital firms are excited about them because historically Republican administrations make them pay less taxes and do whatever they want.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The VP nomination happened even though Vance <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html\">didn&rsquo;t really get on well</a> with Trump in the past which would normally disqualify him from taking a seat anywhere near the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trumps-grudges-are-his-agenda/532395/\">famously grudge-bearing</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/02/jimmy-kimmel-roasts-fragile-snowflake-donald-trump-for-allegedly-trying-to-censor-him\">snowflake</a> who <a href=\"https://www.slowboring.com/p/trump-scams-the-people-who-trust\">turns on even the people who truly trust him</a> whenever it suits him.</p>\n<p>Choice phrases Vance used to describe Trump in the past include &ldquo;a moral disaster&rdquo;, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Hitler&rdquo;, &ldquo;a total fraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>But by 2020 this never-Trumper was publicly voting for Trump, whilst arguing that he too at least semi-believes some version of the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html\">Big Lie</a> and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954\">wouldn&rsquo;t have certified the 2020 electoral result</a> but rather kept himself busy by firing every single civil servant instead. Very normal. Definitely not <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/30/republicans-weird/\">weird</a> (or illegal). And in 2024 he&rsquo;s standing as his best-buddy VP.</p>\n<p>The thirst for power at the expense of everything and everyone else is truly a disgusting thing to watch.</p>\n",

Real [X-Files smoking man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_Smoking_Man) stuff.\n\n>Peltz and Musk also told Trump of an influence campaign in elite circles that is already under way, in which Musk and his political allies host gatherings of powerful business leaders across the country to try to convince them not to support President Biden’s re-election campaign.\n\nWhilst Puck's reporting suggested that the gathering they wrote about was supposedly more anti-Democrat than pro-Trump as a person, we do now know that some of those folk are very invested in supporting Trump as a person; in fact as the most qualified person in the whole of the US to exercise increasingly absolute power over its citizenry.\n\nIn more recent times, particularly since the [assassination attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump) on their preferred leader, Donald Trump, the whole shadowy billionaires having secret meetings about corrupting the political process in favour of Trump with their vast wealth has become less of an amateur secret conspiracy and more a very public stating of preferences and pumping of vast sums of money in order to try and buy the election result that they want, alongside currying favour with the [famously unreliable](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/donald-trumps-consistent-unreliability-on-covid-and-everything-else) but perfectly able-to-be-bribed potential future president that they believe can make all their unhinged dreams come true.\n\nDavid Sacks went from [saying in 2021](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-murdoch-biden-dinner-b2538718.html) that Trump had \"disqualified himself from being a candidate at the national level again\" to [a public endorsement in 2024](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/business/dealbook/silicon-valley-trump.html). Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen are amongst other public supporters and money shovellers.\n\nMusk is one of the larger donors, having recently [pledged to donate $45 million _a month_](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823) to a pro-Trump [Super PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee#Super_PACs) (for the non-Americans amongst us, the relevance of a Super PAC here as far as I understand it is that it's a workaround so very rich people can give way more money to political campaigns than they would technically be allowed to directly). The same PAC is receiving hefty donations from Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale and the Winklevoss twins, who it turns out are now heavily into cryptocurrency.\n\nSo what does one get for $45 million? Well, outside of [a formal role in Trump's government](https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3), it seems that you probably get to choose who the US Vice President is going to be. Unless it was a perfect coincidence that the day after Musk committed that money [Trump announced](https://apnews.com/article/trump-vice-president-vance-rubio-burgum-rnc-6cc438a8370a21b2631f5a53b06b71d0) that his pick was the multi-millionaire JD Vance, who happens to be someone these weird tech billionaires really like.\n\nDespite being famous in the past for having written a book about the travails of being a poor White man in his memoir, which somehow I still haven't read - [Hillbilly Elegy](https://micro.blog/books/9780062872258?title=Hillbilly+Elegy&author=J.+D.+Vance&cover_id=172665) - Vance actually spent many of his earlier years [working as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/trumps-vp-candidate-j-d-vance-has-long-ties-to-silicon-valley-and-was-a-vc-himself/?ref=404media.co) under the afore-mentioned arch-libertarian Peter Thiel. \n\nIn fact the illogically wealthy tech bros like JD Vance so much that mere hours after Trump named him as his VP pick we saw some more of those kind of VCs,  Marc Andreessen - someone who has convinced himself that regulating artificial intelligence is [Ackchyually](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually-actually-guy) \"[a form of murder](https://www.404media.co/marc-andreesen-manifesto-says-ai-regulation-is-a-form-of-murder)\", - and his company's cofounder Ben Horowitz, [publicly express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNclEgQZQ) their support for this dangerous fool.\n\nAs far as I can tell, substantial motivation for this comes from Trumps likelihood of not getting in the way of whatever the latest cryptocurrency scam they want to run is.\n\nAs [The American Prospect writes](https://americanprospect.bluelena.io/index.php?action=social&chash=fa2e8c4385712f9a1d24c363a2cbe5b8.2813&s=e2a6bd41e301af690d8980c64caa4683):\n\n>...to Musk and Thiel and a growing number of the Valley’s biggest players, any infringement on capitalists’ sovereignty is anathema\n\nJD Vance very much sups from the same cup.\n\nAnd it certainly seems to be buying them the outcome they want. See for example the extremely bizarre section of the [Republican's 2024 platform](https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf) whereby they decry any attempts to limit the grift-filled world of cryptocurrency or any attempt to stop AI Hitlers coming to the fore:\n\n>Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto\ncrackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency.\n>\n>We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the\nright to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from\nGovernment Surveillance and Control.\n....\n>\nWe will repeal Joe Biden’s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI\nInnovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this\ntechnology. \n\nSure. it's written in the style of a particularly unhinged kidnapper sending a ransom note, and maybe the founding fathers didn't *technically* list the right to [solving sudokus whilst the world burns](https://kottke.org/21/03/cryptocurrency-explained) as a fundamental human right as such, but I'm sure they would have if they weren't busy with other stuff.\n\n[404 Media notes](https://www.404media.co/email/ae79d8cc-a24b-44dc-81d6-f156b12cdbf4) that of course there's not really any shortage of uncontrolled AI bunkum flying around the world under Biden's administration. Rather:\n\n>...Vance and Trump are not uniquely qualified to support the development of AI. They are simply the Republican nominees, and people at the head of AI companies and venture capital firms are excited about them because historically Republican administrations make them pay less taxes and do whatever they want.\n\nThe VP nomination happened even though Vance [didn't really get on well](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html) with Trump in the past which would normally disqualify him from taking a seat anywhere near the [famously grudge-bearing](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trumps-grudges-are-his-agenda/532395/) [snowflake](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/02/jimmy-kimmel-roasts-fragile-snowflake-donald-trump-for-allegedly-trying-to-censor-him) who [turns on even the people who truly trust him](https://www.slowboring.com/p/trump-scams-the-people-who-trust) whenever it suits him.\n\nChoice phrases Vance used to describe Trump in the past include \"a moral disaster\", \"America's Hitler\", \"a total fraud\" and \"reprehensible\".\n\nBut by 2020 this never-Trumper was publicly voting for Trump, whilst arguing that he too at least semi-believes some version of the [Big Lie](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html) and [wouldn't have certified the 2020 electoral result](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954) but rather kept himself busy by firing every single civil servant instead. Very normal. Definitely not [weird](https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/30/republicans-weird/) (or illegal). And in 2024 he's standing as his best-buddy VP.\n\nThe thirst for power at the expense of everything and everyone else is truly a disgusting thing to watch.\n",

Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen seem to regard &ldquo;The Future&rdquo; as a distinct step down from its best-selling award-winning predecessor - not that it is a sequel as such; it stands alone.

One of my fellow countryfolk apparently once opened a continuous sequence of [29 out of 29 double-yolked eggs](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/british-woman-cracks-open-29-doubleyolked-eggs-in-a-row-2304092.html) (not, of course, from guaranteed double-yolk boxes, that would be even more irrelevant news than this post). And as for a single egg, well, the current world record appears to be an egg that contained an astonishing [nine yolks](https://people.howstuffworks.com/why-are-people-superstitious-about-double-yolked-eggs.htm). \n",

For $20 a year.</p>\n<p>For anyone else who has old tech that&rsquo;s too slow for the more mainstream operating systems, yet correctly detests unnecessary e-waste, I strongly advise you give Linux a go. Despite its reputation, these days if things go smoothly it&rsquo;s not an immense technical challenge to install, and it&rsquo;s certainly not hard to use for day-to-day work and play once it is installed. At least if you go for one of the distributions that prioritises ease of use and/or consistency with the computing experiences of other operating systems (<a href=\"https://www.linuxmint.com/\">Linux Mint</a> being one of those, many other options exist). So you&rsquo;ve not got a lot to lose if you alternative is throwing the machine away.</p>\n<p>Plus there&rsquo;s no shortage of high quality Linux software to replace your Windows apps. Much of it is free of charge and it&rsquo;s often extremely easy to install thanks to various pre-installed graphical package managers. And in the case that you do need to run Windows programs, technologies like <a href=\"https://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</a> might get you there.</p>\n<p>I soon learned to enjoy Linux more than Windows. I&rsquo;d set it up as a dual boot system but found that I never actually booted to Windows. Thus I figured that this time I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy a laptop designed for and preinstalled with Linux to replace it. I imagined it might even be a cheaper option give there&rsquo;d be no Windows licensing costs for manufacturers to pay. As much as I&rsquo;d enjoy some £5000 power-beast it&rsquo;s just not going to happen right now short of a lottery win.</p>\n<p>Turns out I was very wrong, unless I just didn&rsquo;t search well enough.</p>\n<p>Not all that many companies seem to sell new machines with Linux pre-installed on. <a href=\"https://system76.com/\">System76</a> seem to be amongst the most famous dedicated providers of Linux offerings. But all are substantially above $1000, even without considering any shipping costs to the UK.  <a href=\"https://junocomputers.com/\">Juno Computers</a> are another option. Their &ldquo;<a href=\"https://junocomputers.com/product-category/laptops/entry-level/\">entry level</a>&rdquo; laptops appear to start from £970.

To be honest I haven&rsquo;t done the research to know the answer to this question, which almost certainly has an an actual answer. But heaven forbid I do my homework. So I&rsquo;m just going to make guesses, that it&rsquo;s one or more of these potential reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux laptops are not at all popular. It&rsquo;s a niche market. It&rsquo;s much more expensive per item to make things fewer people buy.</li>\n<li>Maybe they tend to have better hardware? I guess it&rsquo;s probably nerd types that tend to want them. Perhaps they&rsquo;re more likely than average to care about performance.</li>\n<li>If you&rsquo;re intending to support your customer&rsquo;s usage of your machine then there would presumably be ongoing costs for that. It must be harder (more expensive) to find agents who can help people solve Linux problems than Windows.</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;d also have to make sure that drivers etc. for all the hardware you include exist in Linux - and write and maintain them if not.</li>\n<li>Most Windows PC manufacturers and distributors appear to pre-install a load of truly garbage software that you probably don&rsquo;t want on the system before selling it to you. Clearly this is not for altruistic reasons. Maybe the kickback they get from doing that is so high that it more than makes up for the cost of Windows.</li>\n<li>Perhaps the people that want Linux laptops <em>really</em> want Linux laptops so will pay more? And far be it from any company to not exploit every possible £ of revenue opportunity.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;m sure OEMs don&rsquo;t pay the same for Windows as us mere people do. Perhaps Windows is very cheap for them, or they even receive benefits from Microsoft for ensuring more folk get into their ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nonetheless it seems like a potentially missed opportunity. You can buy (low-performing) Chromebooks for not much more than £100. But I don&rsquo;t think I could live with a Google operating system, and I&rsquo;d assume a lack of software choice from the point of those of us who enjoy tinkering, who love options screens with 100 preferences, who occasionally might want to do our own coding.</p>\n<p>So, despite my philosophical and in-practice preferences, I&rsquo;m opting for some sub-£500 Windows machine. In any case, there&rsquo;s always the option to replace Windows with Linux, which I can totally see myself doing in short order. But I guess I will experiment with Windows 11 for a bit first given I&rsquo;ve never used it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>That decision does mean I&rsquo;ll probably want to dedicate some time to reading and acting on a ton of articles like &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-disable-annoying-ads-on-windows-11\">How to disable annoying ads on Windows 11</a>&rsquo;  and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://uk.pcmag.com/tune-up-utilities/40364/how-to-remove-bloatware-from-your-new-pc\">How to remove bloatware from your new PC</a>&rdquo; to try and minimise the semi-spyware and advertising networks that apparently infuse Microsoft&rsquo;s latest creation, an apparently ever more <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html\">enshittifying</a> iteration.</p>\n<p>Ads in the Start menu, in <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/how-to/block-ads-in-windows-11\">File Explorer</a>, maybe even in <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1814672/microsoft-ads-show-up-in-start-menu-in-early-microsoft-tests.html\">Settings</a> for crying out loud - although perhaps fair to note that most of the latter ads are  likely for Microsoft services that are supposed to improve your experience, such as OneDrive - if you&rsquo;re willing to pay.

It's awkward to say and none are perfect, but some sources do remain inherently more reputable than others. And if only one or two sources are reporting some clearly world-shattering news then you might be extra sceptical that it ever happened. For example, no British newspaper of record is going to forget to mention a complete revolution in, some would say destruction of, the basic principles of how the NHS works\n\nThe whole show seems to be freely available on YouTube - legitimately! - so here we go:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7vXlBZlV7Ks?si=5kWTgSCGS77y3pCK\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781785785061\">Lost in a Good Game</a> by Pete Etchells.</p>\n<p>Since childhood the author, <a href=\"https://www.peteetchells.com/\">Professor Pete Etchells</a>, has deeply enjoyed playing video games. Some now have special meaning to him. And now he&rsquo;s a Professor of Psychology and Science Communication  he&rsquo;s written a book that is an intriguing mix of tales of his personal gaming experience along with a more objective review of what the science so far tells us about the effects of gaming on humans, good or bad.</p>\n<p>Gaming certainly seems to have brought him solace throughout some challenging parts of his life, which he goes into in detail. He lovingly writes about certain games; what they&rsquo;re about, how he participated, who he played with and so on. Anyone who has played many of the mega hits over the past few decades may well identify fondly with these parts. Anyone unfamiliar with, or wary of, videogaming in general might probably learn a lot about the hobby - and perhaps be surprised at the wide range and depth of the full gamut of things we call computer games. It&rsquo;s not all gem-laden Match 3 phone apps.</p>\n<p>On one hand, as he mentions, there&rsquo;s a school of thought that suggests his love of gaming might make it hard for him to research the topic objectively. But the opposing school of thought, to which he belongs, argues that in fact people who are experienced gamers can do better research because they already have the necessary background to understand the nuances of content and context involved within the activity.</p>\n<p>Although not always thought of this way, games are a fairly unique form of art in that we are (often) in control of them rather than passive observers. This can give us a sense of personal investment and immersion that we don&rsquo;t find in other artistic domains. Games might give us a sense of exploration, provide escapism, or connections to other people. It might vary by game, by person, and over time. All in all, they can be a very personal experience that leave us with memories of hopefully good times and on occasion maybe teach us something about ourselves.</p>\n<p>We also learn a lot about the history of video games, which is longer than one might expect. The first computer that was capable of playing a game against a human was apparently &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_(computer)\">Nimrod</a>&rdquo;, which was exhibited in 1951. By the 1960-70s games were starting to move from the computer lab into arcades.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong\">Pong</a>, the first digital arcade game release, came out in 1972.</p>\n<p>He then looks into why we play video games. The upshot is 1) that different people play for different reasons at different times, and 2) it&rsquo;s hard to get an unbiased view on those reasons. This uncertainty and unknowingness is a key theme to which we return to a lot when it comes to evaluating the science of gaming.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most commonly used classifications of why an individual plays games are those based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bartle\">Richard Bartle&rsquo;s work</a> of 1996. Bartle observed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\">four main groups</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Achievers: players who aim to score points, collect treasures, level up their characters.</li>\n<li>Explorers: players who like to find out more about the virtual world.</li>\n<li>Socialisers: Players who aim to communicate with people who they share an interest with.</li>\n<li>Killers: players who like to fight or otherwise annoy other players.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But Bartle makes never claimed that these are particularly scientific. It&rsquo;s just what he picked up after talking to countless players over the years.</p>\n<p>More generally regarding motivations, Etchells touches on <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-determination-theory.html\">self-determination theory</a>.  That&rsquo;s an idea from psychology that suggests our behaviours are driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The intrinsic side of things is probably why we participate in most forms of play and sports, and hence is likely relevant to video games. Three key components of intrinsic motivation emanate from our human desires for competence, autonomy and relatedness - all of which (some) games can provide.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of confusion we need to concern ourselves about in the literature and beyond. Firstly what is the definition of a video game? Call of Duty? Candy Crush? Both? And if both, do we risk conflating too much when we talk about &ldquo;video gaming&rdquo;. Why should one produce the same effects as another? In which case, it&rsquo;s questionable how useful it is to talk about &ldquo;the effects of videogames&rdquo; as a whole.</p>\n<p>Computer games are also a newish form of art. Today&rsquo;s grandparents, and possibly parents, we&rsquo;re unlikely to have grown up playing them. This leads to a very understandable fear of the unknown, exacerbated by media scare stories. I think the author sees this kind of sentiment as the latest in a historical line of &ldquo;these new things are ruining your children&rdquo; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic\">moral panics</a>.</p>\n<p>We then learn about the bad scientific practices that infuse historical video games research - and indeed psychology in general. Conclusions emanating from bad science are rarely useful. This section is worth reading to learn more about what makes for good or bad science even if you have no interest in video games.</p>\n<p>As well as statistical trickery, there&rsquo;s also the fundamental questions of what research questions are asked. The author believes that the vast majority of research has pursued a very limited number of questions, mainly around the harms of video games and in particular their link with violence. A study will never report any positive effects of video gaming if it is not set up to look for them. A habit of critical thinking is to be encouraged.</p>\n<p>In addition to any outright fraud, there&rsquo;s a wide range of what have come to be known as <a href=\"https://ukrio.org/wp-content/uploads/Simon-Kolstoe-Guidance-QRPs-2023.pdf\">questionable research practices </a>to consider, some of which historically are extremely prevalent in psychological research. Here we&rsquo;re talking about both individual-researcher controlled behaviours things like <a href=\"https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/p-hacking/\">p hacking</a> as well as more structural issues such as the <a href=\"https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/filedrawer.html\">file drawer effect</a> and so on.</p>\n<p>So what does Etchells conclude as being the verdict of whether video games harm us, make us violent and so on? What mainly comes across from this book is the sad fact that we just don&rsquo;t know very much. There are certainly studies that claim to show harm. But there are other studies that claim to show no harm, or even some benefit. Many, perhaps almost all, of these studies are suspect, or at least incomplete, in one way or another. It&rsquo;s not even clear that we know how to measure something like aggression in a way that we should actually care about in terms of negative real word outcomes.</p>\n<p>His take, which makes sense to me, is that the mixed messages coming out of this body of work mean that it&rsquo;s unlikely that the games studied so far have a huge effect either way on outcomes such as real-world violence. Certainly there is not nearly the ubiquitous evidence for harm you would assume there is if you read only the moral panic driven newspaper headlines on this topic. But this is of course not evidence that games can&rsquo;t cause any harm to anyone in any circumstance. The author finds it likely that some people are more prone to harm from video games than others, and some more prone to benefit - the same as almost any other such activity humans get up to in life.</p>\n<p>He is particularly concerned about the more recent &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; in gaming which have, necessarily, been studied less. Examples include the added immersion caused by virtual reality and the all-too-present prevalence of what are essentially addictive gambling mechanisms - or indeed actual gambling - that infuse many of today&rsquo;s most popular games, especially on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>In 2018 gaming addiction was classified as a mental health disorder by the WHO, although there is apparently much debate in academia as to whether this is a good thing or not. The author reports that there&rsquo;s certainly no agreement over how prevalent this diagnosis is or where its boundaries should lie, which are problems in themselves when it comes to making sense of or acting on such a potential problem.</p>\n<p>Games usually show up on screens, so one chapter in the book deals with the perils and pleasures of screen time. Sadly the same kind of conclusions on the science show up here as we saw in the critique of gaming science. There&rsquo;s no universally accepted 100% definitive science showing that screen time is bad or good, and little in the way of reliably measuring or classifying it in the first place. Once again, perhaps not all screen time is the same or likely to have the same effect, any more than all videogames are the same.</p>\n<p>He cautions us to think of screens as merely a tool. As with any tool we should learn to use them properly. We control them, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>We later learn about how games can produce data that aids science, leading to more understanding about the human body and brain works. We end a chapter on e-sports, which even 6 years ago was a $900 million industry, and one on loss. That&rsquo;s loss both of the personal type but also in the sense of how we could or should preserve games themselves. This proves to be a much greater challenge than simply putting some 30 year old disk in a safe somewhere and hoping for the best. Apart from any technical issues, there&rsquo;s more to gaming and gaming culture we should want to share and remember than a series of magnetic 0s and 1s.</p>\n<p>His final conclusion is not all that satisfying. But it is what we apparently have and hence should drive how we should think about the topic when we&rsquo;re making our own decisions about gaming. <a href=\"https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/tools/rumsfeld-matrix\">Known unknowns</a> are, after all, better than unknown unknowns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are games good or bad for us? The honest answer is that we don’t convincingly know either way, and it’s probably a bit of both&hellip;</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>As much as they’re a form of entertainment, they’re also a tool: one that must be treated with respect and responsibility, in the full knowledge that if used improperly or without due care and attention, they may cause as much damage as good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

In which case, it's questionable how useful it is to talk about \"the effects of videogames\" as a whole.\r\n\r\nComputer games are also a newish form of art. Today's grandparents, and possibly parents, we're unlikely to have grown up playing them. This leads to a very understandable fear of the unknown, exacerbated by media scare stories. I think the author sees this kind of sentiment as the latest in a historical line of \"these new things are ruining your children\" [moral panics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic).\r\n\r\nWe then learn about the bad scientific practices that infuse historical video games research - and indeed psychology in general. Conclusions emanating from bad science are rarely useful. This section is worth reading to learn more about what makes for good or bad science even if you have no interest in video games.\r\n\r\nAs well as statistical trickery, there's also the fundamental questions of what research questions are asked. The author believes that the vast majority of research has pursued a very limited number of questions, mainly around the harms of video games and in particular their link with violence. A study will never report any positive effects of video gaming if it is not set up to look for them. A habit of critical thinking is to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to any outright fraud, there's a wide range of what have come to be known as [questionable research practices ](https://ukrio.org/wp-content/uploads/Simon-Kolstoe-Guidance-QRPs-2023.pdf)to consider, some of which historically are extremely prevalent in psychological research. Here we're talking about both individual-researcher controlled behaviours things like [p hacking](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/p-hacking/) as well as more structural issues such as the [file drawer effect](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/filedrawer.html) and so on.\r\n\r\nSo what does Etchells conclude as being the verdict of whether video games harm us, make us violent and so on? What mainly comes across from this book is the sad fact that we just don't know very much. There are certainly studies that claim to show harm. But there are other studies that claim to show no harm, or even some benefit. Many, perhaps almost all, of these studies are suspect, or at least incomplete, in one way or another. It's not even clear that we know how to measure something like aggression in a way that we should actually care about in terms of negative real word outcomes.\r\n\r\nHis take, which makes sense to me, is that the mixed messages coming out of this body of work mean that it's unlikely that the games studied so far have a huge effect either way on outcomes such as real-world violence. Certainly there is not nearly the ubiquitous evidence for harm you would assume there is if you read only the moral panic driven newspaper headlines on this topic. But this is of course not evidence that games can't cause any harm to anyone in any circumstance. The author finds it likely that some people are more prone to harm from video games than others, and some more prone to benefit - the same as almost any other such activity humans get up to in life. \r\n\r\nHe is particularly concerned about the more recent \"innovations\" in gaming which have, necessarily, been studied less. Examples include the added immersion caused by virtual reality and the all-too-present prevalence of what are essentially addictive gambling mechanisms - or indeed actual gambling - that infuse many of today's most popular games, especially on mobile devices.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 gaming addiction was classified as a mental health disorder by the WHO, although there is apparently much debate in academia as to whether this is a good thing or not. The author reports that there's certainly no agreement over how prevalent this diagnosis is or where its boundaries should lie, which are problems in themselves when it comes to making sense of or acting on such a potential problem.\r\n\r\nGames usually show up on screens, so one chapter in the book deals with the perils and pleasures of screen time. Sadly the same kind of conclusions on the science show up here as we saw in the critique of gaming science. There's no universally accepted 100% definitive science showing that screen time is bad or good, and little in the way of reliably measuring or classifying it in the first place. Once again, perhaps not all screen time is the same or likely to have the same effect, any more than all videogames are the same.\r\n\r\nHe cautions us to think of screens as merely a tool. As with any tool we should learn to use them properly. We control them, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nWe later learn about how games can produce data that aids science, leading to more understanding about the human body and brain works. We end a chapter on e-sports, which even 6 years ago was a $900 million industry, and one on loss. That's loss both of the personal type but also in the sense of how we could or should preserve games themselves. This proves to be a much greater challenge than simply putting some 30 year old disk in a safe somewhere and hoping for the best. Apart from any technical issues, there's more to gaming and gaming culture we should want to share and remember than a series of magnetic 0s and 1s.\r\n\r\nHis final conclusion is not all that satisfying. But it is what we apparently have and hence should drive how we should think about the topic when we're making our own decisions about gaming. [Known unknowns](https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/tools/rumsfeld-matrix) are, after all, better than unknown unknowns. \r\n\r\n> Are games good or bad for us? The honest answer is that we don’t convincingly know either way, and it’s probably a bit of both...\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n> \r\n> As much as they’re a form of entertainment, they’re also a tool: one that must be treated with respect and responsibility, in the full knowledge that if used improperly or without due care and attention, they may cause as much damage as good.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/liagg.jpeg\" width=\"250\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Lost in a Good Game book cover\">\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📺 Watched <a href=\"https://trakt.tv/shows/pompeii-the-new-dig\">Pompeii: The New Dig</a>.</p>\n<p>The BBC shows us some days in the lives of an Italian archeology team as they continue the 100+ year effort to uncover what&rsquo;s under the horrific mess that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79_AD\">eruption of the Mount Vesuvius volcano</a> caused to be rained down upon the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii\">city of Pompeii</a>. in the the year 79 AD.</p>\n<p>Much of the city, its contents and the physical remains of the poor people who were stuck there at the time has been astonishingly well preserved by virtue of it all being covered by huge layers of ash. There&rsquo;s been various efforts to unearth it over the years - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii#Modern_archaeology\">Wikipedia</a> gives the modern archaeological effort a start date in the 1920s. But the very start of the process could be a lot earlier depending on when you start counting from.</p>\n<p>However, over 100 years later, a surprising-to-me amount of it is still buried under the ash, despite the complex now being a popular tourist site. So this <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001yczx\">new BBC documentary</a> follows a team of Italian archeologists as they excavate a whole new city block.</p>\n<p>Discoveries abound; including potentially the world&rsquo;s first ever known illustration of a pizza no less. Although the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/pompeii-the-new-dig-review-not-exciting-tv-3007544\">i newspaper</a> is not entirely wrong to suggest that, whilst the discoveries themselves are exciting, it is hard at times to translate that thrill to a 3 hour documentary series where most of the work involved in getting to the discoveries consists of people meticulously digging into piles of dirt.

				"content_text": "📺 Watched [Pompeii: The New Dig](https://trakt.tv/shows/pompeii-the-new-dig).\r\n\r\nThe BBC shows us some days in the lives of an Italian archeology team as they continue the 100+ year effort to uncover what's under the horrific mess that the [eruption of the Mount Vesuvius volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79_AD) caused to be rained down upon the [city of Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii). in the the year 79 AD.\r\n\r\nMuch of the city, its contents and the physical remains of the poor people who were stuck there at the time has been astonishingly well preserved by virtue of it all being covered by huge layers of ash. There's been various efforts to unearth it over the years - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii#Modern_archaeology) gives the modern archaeological effort a start date in the 1920s. But the very start of the process could be a lot earlier depending on when you start counting from.\r\n\r\nHowever, over 100 years later, a surprising-to-me amount of it is still buried under the ash, despite the complex now being a popular tourist site. So this [new BBC documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001yczx) follows a team of Italian archeologists as they excavate a whole new city block.\r\n\r\nDiscoveries abound; including potentially the world's first ever known illustration of a pizza no less. Although the [i newspaper](https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/pompeii-the-new-dig-review-not-exciting-tv-3007544) is not entirely wrong to suggest that, whilst the discoveries themselves are exciting, it is hard at times to translate that thrill to a 3 hour documentary series where most of the work involved in getting to the discoveries consists of people meticulously digging into piles of dirt. Nonetheless, the end product certainly seems to make their toil worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to include any more find-spoilers here, but for anyone who is interested enough in the topic to want to see what was unearthed, but not interested enough to spend 3 hours watching the process and commentary, the [History Extra website](https://www.historyextra.com/period/roman/pompeii-the-new-dig-what-we-learned/) lists some of the brightest and best finds.

				"title": "Some services that help transfer your music library and playlists between different music streaming services",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m slowly weaning myself away from the use of the mainstream music streaming service - <a href=\"https://spotify.com/\">Spotify</a> et al - both due to <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html\">the problematic effects</a> they increasingly seem to have on the industry and the now-radical idea that I might want to permanently own my music collection.</p>\n<p>That said, I&rsquo;m not there yet, and perhaps there will always be a role for them when it comes to, for instance, modern-day music discovery. Problematic or not, they do indisputably provide tremendous accessibility to a music library far beyond the ability of most individual humans to cultivate.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, I wanted to reduce the fragility of my situation by replicating my library as far as possible between more than one service.</p>\n<p>If, for instance, I only have my music libraries in the walled garden of <a href=\"https://music.apple.com/\">Apple Music</a>, there&rsquo;s a (possibly paranoid) feeling that should they ever close my account, I feel compelled to close my account, some bug means they lose the details of my collection or I simply can&rsquo;t afford the subscription any more then not only can I obviously no longer listen to my hand-picked collection, I also entirely lose access to what that collection was in the first place. Which albums I added to my libraries, which tracks I liked, the algorithm that suggests new music to me, all gone.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much I can do about the latter, algorithms are virtually never accessible or portable in their current instantiation. But in terms of one&rsquo;s library and playlists, it is possible to try and recreate that in another service, say Spotify.</p>\n<p>This will never work perfectly as another issue with the services is they don&rsquo;t necessarily have the same music. If for instance you switch to Spotify from Apple or vice versa you may simply not have the option to listen to some of your preferred tracks, they&rsquo;re just not on the service. Such is the penalty of not owning your collection. However, realistically, if your collection is vaguely mainstream most of it probably exists in most of the big services.</p>\n<p>However, these wannabe-prison services do not want you to leave, so offer no universal way to export or import a useful list of what is in your collection that I can see. Data portability is probably the last thing they want - and something I&rsquo;d love regulators to enforce one day. But for now by default it&rsquo;d be a manual effort, laboriously going through everything you care about on one service and trying to search for it on the other service, saving to library, liking, whatever.</p>\n<p>This is fairly untenable, or at least very tedious, if you have anything beyond a fairly small collection. But there are third party solutions that attempt to solve this problem by automating the search-and-save operation. You would have to give them access to the accounts you wish to transfer from and to, but if you&rsquo;re comfortable with this then they can attempt to automate copying your libraries and playlists from one service to another.</p>\n<p>In my case, I&rsquo;m a big listen-to-albums fan so I was most concerned in copying my library of albums across to a new service. Let&rsquo;s assume Apple Music to Spotify to take a common example. Importantly. I wanted my album library to appear as actual albums in Spotify, not as playlists containing the album&rsquo;s songs. Some people prefer the latter of course or only use playlists in the first place. There&rsquo;s no right way to do this kind of stuff.</p>\n<p>So below is a list of services that promise to do this kind of thing that I compiled from a few searches for apps and services that can automate this transition, including what at-a-glance appeared to me as being their scope and their costs.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a fairly wide range of pricing and features. Most are subscription based, although if you only want to do this kind of thing once you could just buy one month. You will generally have to pay if you have anything beyond a very small library, although many have a limited free version you could test to see how well it&rsquo;s going to work for you.</p>\n<p>A common feature some have is a continual sync of libraries across services.

				"content_text": "I'm slowly weaning myself away from the use of the mainstream music streaming service - [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) et al - both due to [the problematic effects](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html) they increasingly seem to have on the industry and the now-radical idea that I might want to permanently own my music collection.\n\nThat said, I'm not there yet, and perhaps there will always be a role for them when it comes to, for instance, modern-day music discovery. Problematic or not, they do indisputably provide tremendous accessibility to a music library far beyond the ability of most individual humans to cultivate. \n\nIn the mean time, I wanted to reduce the fragility of my situation by replicating my library as far as possible between more than one service.\n\nIf, for instance, I only have my music libraries in the walled garden of [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/), there's a (possibly paranoid) feeling that should they ever close my account, I feel compelled to close my account, some bug means they lose the details of my collection or I simply can't afford the subscription any more then not only can I obviously no longer listen to my hand-picked collection, I also entirely lose access to what that collection was in the first place. Which albums I added to my libraries, which tracks I liked, the algorithm that suggests new music to me, all gone.\n\nI don't think there's much I can do about the latter, algorithms are virtually never accessible or portable in their current instantiation. But in terms of one's library and playlists, it is possible to try and recreate that in another service, say Spotify.\n\nThis will never work perfectly as another issue with the services is they don't necessarily have the same music. If for instance you switch to Spotify from Apple or vice versa you may simply not have the option to listen to some of your preferred tracks, they're just not on the service. Such is the penalty of not owning your collection. However, realistically, if your collection is vaguely mainstream most of it probably exists in most of the big services.\n\nHowever, these wannabe-prison services do not want you to leave, so offer no universal way to export or import a useful list of what is in your collection that I can see. Data portability is probably the last thing they want - and something I'd love regulators to enforce one day. But for now by default it'd be a manual effort, laboriously going through everything you care about on one service and trying to search for it on the other service, saving to library, liking, whatever. \n\nThis is fairly untenable, or at least very tedious, if you have anything beyond a fairly small collection. But there are third party solutions that attempt to solve this problem by automating the search-and-save operation. You would have to give them access to the accounts you wish to transfer from and to, but if you're comfortable with this then they can attempt to automate copying your libraries and playlists from one service to another.\n\nIn my case, I'm a big listen-to-albums fan so I was most concerned in copying my library of albums across to a new service. Let's assume Apple Music to Spotify to take a common example. Importantly. I wanted my album library to appear as actual albums in Spotify, not as playlists containing the album's songs. Some people prefer the latter of course or only use playlists in the first place. There's no right way to do this kind of stuff.\n\nSo below is a list of services that promise to do this kind of thing that I compiled from a few searches for apps and services that can automate this transition, including what at-a-glance appeared to me as being their scope and their costs.\n\nThere's a fairly wide range of pricing and features. Most are subscription based, although if you only want to do this kind of thing once you could just buy one month. You will generally have to pay if you have anything beyond a very small library, although many have a limited free version you could test to see how well it's going to work for you. \n\nA common feature some have is a continual sync of libraries across services. I was mainly interested just in testing a one-time operation at present but I can imagine use-cases for the latter. \n\nWhilst my examples above all about Apple Music and Spotify, many of these products handle a much wider range of services so don't let that put you off.\n\nNone of these are recommendations as such as I haven't yet tried them.

Season 3 and 4 I haven't yet had the pleasure of.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning though, the show does hit a bit differently in a today's world where [artificially intelligent drink-serving robots already exist](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/figure-is-putting.html), albeit typically less clothed in artificial human skin than their Westworld equivalents are. \r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img  src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/dh.webp\" width=\"472\" height=\"311\" alt=\"A creepy white humanoid android\" />\r\n<figcaption>A creepy 'drone host' from Westworld.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img  src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/figure.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"A silver real-world humanoid android from figure.ai\" />\r\n<figcaption>A creepy robot from our world (from <a href = \"https://www.figure.ai/\">figure.ai</a>).</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't stop there.

				"title": "Tom Hunt's predicament is a perfect example of why voter ID laws are usually bad laws",
				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday the UK saw a swathe of local and other miscellaneous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/england/results\">elections taking place</a>. It&rsquo;s one of the first occasions Britons have been to the polls en masse since the <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/no-id-no-vote-voter-id-comes-to-great-britain/\">introduction of the law</a> requiring you to bring certain types of photo ID with you to the polling station in order to be allowed to vote.</p>\n<p>This policy was introduced via Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Conservative government via the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/37/contents/enacted\">Elections Act 2022</a>. So it was rather darkly hilarious to learn that day before the elections were to run, Conservative <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-mp-voter-id-local-elections-b2538329.html?utm_source=press.coop\">MP Tom Hunt realised that he had no suitable ID</a> and hence wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to vote.</p>\n<p>The reason we know about this is because someone leaked a Whatsapp message (of course!) where he was asking fellow Tory party members to help him out via being his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/voting-by-proxy\">emergency proxy</a>, a facility designed for people who lose their ID amongst other circumstances, that I&rsquo;m certain the vast majority of the UK populous doesn&rsquo;t know about. If they even know about the photo ID requirement in the first place; for such a big change I at least haven&rsquo;t seen any publicity around it recently.</p>\n<p>It later came to light that <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/conservative-mp-tom-hunt-photo-id-elections-dyspraxia-b1155272.html\">he suffers from a medical condition called dyspraxia</a> , which is what he attributes his overweight to. Some of the symptoms of that condition <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder\">include</a> &ldquo;difficulty with organisation and/or problems with attention, working memory and time management&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible and may make the more vicious commentators of a certain type tone down their output, as tempting an opportunity as it is.</p>\n<p>But, as a friend noted, another thing Tom&rsquo;s situation perfectly demonstrates is why voter ID requirements tend to be bad laws that cause unjust disenfranchisement in the first place.</p>\n<p>Back in 2022, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/six-reasons-britains-impending-voter-id-law-is-a-bad-idea-196436\">Toby James</a> shared six reasons why introducing the voter ID law to Britain was a bad idea.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is no evidence of voter fraud.</li>\n<li>Photographic voter ID could deny legitimate voters</li>\n<li>Photo ID discriminates</li>\n<li>Voter identification is expensive</li>\n<li>The change is happening at too short notice</li>\n<li>Other problems need fixing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some of these seem more serious than others to me - but points 2 and 3 exactly describe the situation with Mr. Hunt. There&rsquo;s no question he was a legitimate voter. And had he not known about the proxy workaround, or been unable for any reason to use it, he would have been denied his right to vote.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf\">research for the government</a> carried out in 2021 put the number of people who say they have no recognisable photo ID they could use was 4%. That might sound low, but as James notes it&rsquo;s equivalent to 1.9 million potential voters. And that&rsquo;s just any recognisable photo ID. The proportion of people reporting that they don&rsquo;t have any recognisable photo ID <em>that hasn&rsquo;t expired</em> is more than twice that, 9%.</p>\n<p>In reality, I&rsquo;d wager that the number of people who say that they have usable, in-date, photo ID is somewhat higher than the number of people that can actually locate such a thing and remember to provide it at a polling station.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, having some kind of disability puts Hunt in one of the many groups that have a higher risk of being prevented from voting than others as a result of this law.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf\">same governmental research</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>12% of respondents with a severely limiting disability and eight per cent of those with a somewhat limiting difficulty said that having to present photo ID at the polling station would make voting difficult, compared with four per cent of those with no disability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of that relates to their concurrent finding that people with a disability are less likely to have appropriate photo ID in the first place. Other groups that also had lesser rates of having ID include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older people, especially those who were 85+ years old.</li>\n<li>Unemployed people.</li>\n<li>Those with few educational qualifications.</li>\n<li>Those who haven&rsquo;t previously voted.</li>\n<li>People living in certain regions of the UK, e.g. West Midlands, South West and Yorkshire and the Humber.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As ever, it&rsquo;s perhaps of note that these are different segments of the population that those who typically work in politics or the media.</p>\n<p>Younger people aged 18-29 were actually more likely to report having a photo ID than the rest of the population. Although if they were talking about their travelcards then that would be meaningless giving a strange-on-the-surface decision by the government to allow the Oyster travel card issued to 60+ year olds as valid voter ID, but not the Oyster travel card issued to 18+ year old students or the railcards issued to 16-25 year olds. There is an actual reason for this that relates to the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/oyster-card-voter-id/\">differing application processes</a> for the two types of cards which can certainly be discussed - but the survey I&rsquo;m took the above numbers from certainly didn&rsquo;t include that nuance.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/campaigns/voter-id/\">Electoral Reform Society</a> has similar concerns. As does the <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/political-mindsets/the-government-must-not-disenfranchise-low-income-voters-at-the-polls\">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> who, focusing on the economic dimension of privilege, wrote that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;there is a very real risk that the Government’s Elections Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will disenfranchise around 1.7 million voters living on a low income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And note that making available an option to get a &ldquo;free&rdquo; photo ID is no panacea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s not easy, or necessarily going to be a priority, to apply to your local authority for a free Voter Card if you’re working in an insecure job with irregular, unpredictable and long hours, or juggling multiple jobs to make ends meet while also managing caring responsibilities and health needs.

				"content_text": "Yesterday the UK saw a swathe of local and other miscellaneous [elections taking place](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/england/results). It's one of the first occasions Britons have been to the polls en masse since the [introduction of the law](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/no-id-no-vote-voter-id-comes-to-great-britain/) requiring you to bring certain types of photo ID with you to the polling station in order to be allowed to vote.\n\nThis policy was introduced via Boris Johnson's Conservative government via the [Elections Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/37/contents/enacted). So it was rather darkly hilarious to learn that day before the elections were to run, Conservative [MP Tom Hunt realised that he had no suitable ID](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-mp-voter-id-local-elections-b2538329.html?utm_source=press.coop) and hence wasn't going to be able to vote.\n\nThe reason we know about this is because someone leaked a Whatsapp message (of course!) where he was asking fellow Tory party members to help him out via being his [emergency proxy](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/voting-by-proxy), a facility designed for people who lose their ID amongst other circumstances, that I'm certain the vast majority of the UK populous doesn't know about. If they even know about the photo ID requirement in the first place; for such a big change I at least haven't seen any publicity around it recently.\n\nIt later came to light that [he suffers from a medical condition called dyspraxia](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/conservative-mp-tom-hunt-photo-id-elections-dyspraxia-b1155272.html) , which is what he attributes his overweight to. Some of the symptoms of that condition [include](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder) \"difficulty with organisation and/or problems with attention, working memory and time management\" so it's perfectly plausible and may make the more vicious commentators of a certain type tone down their output, as tempting an opportunity as it is.\n\nBut, as a friend noted, another thing Tom's situation perfectly demonstrates is why voter ID requirements tend to be bad laws that cause unjust disenfranchisement in the first place.\n\nBack in 2022, [Toby James](https://theconversation.com/six-reasons-britains-impending-voter-id-law-is-a-bad-idea-196436) shared six reasons why introducing the voter ID law to Britain was a bad idea.\n\n1. There is no evidence of voter fraud.\n2. Photographic voter ID could deny legitimate voters\n3. Photo ID discriminates\n4. Voter identification is expensive\n5. The change is happening at too short notice\n6. Other problems need fixing\n\nSome of these seem more serious than others to me - but points 2 and 3 exactly describe the situation with Mr. Hunt. There's no question he was a legitimate voter. And had he not known about the proxy workaround, or been unable for any reason to use it, he would have been denied his right to vote.\n\nSome [research for the government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf) carried out in 2021 put the number of people who say they have no recognisable photo ID they could use was 4%. That might sound low, but as James notes it's equivalent to 1.9 million potential voters. And that's just any recognisable photo ID. The proportion of people reporting that they don't have any recognisable photo ID *that hasn't expired* is more than twice that, 9%.\n\nIn reality, I'd wager that the number of people who say that they have usable, in-date, photo ID is somewhat higher than the number of people that can actually locate such a thing and remember to provide it at a polling station.\n\nFurthermore, having some kind of disability puts Hunt in one of the many groups that have a higher risk of being prevented from voting than others as a result of this law. \n\nFrom the [same governmental research](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf):\n\n> 12% of respondents with a severely limiting disability and eight per cent of those with a somewhat limiting difficulty said that having to present photo ID at the polling station would make voting difficult, compared with four per cent of those with no disability.\n\nSome of that relates to their concurrent finding that people with a disability are less likely to have appropriate photo ID in the first place. Other groups that also had lesser rates of having ID include:\n\n- Older people, especially those who were 85+ years old.\n- Unemployed people.\n- Those with few educational qualifications.\n- Those who haven't previously voted.\n- People living in certain regions of the UK, e.g. West Midlands, South West and Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\nAs ever, it's perhaps of note that these are different segments of the population that those who typically work in politics or the media.\n\nYounger people aged 18-29 were actually more likely to report having a photo ID than the rest of the population. Although if they were talking about their travelcards then that would be meaningless giving a strange-on-the-surface decision by the government to allow the Oyster travel card issued to 60+ year olds as valid voter ID, but not the Oyster travel card issued to 18+ year old students or the railcards issued to 16-25 year olds. There is an actual reason for this that relates to the [differing application processes](https://fullfact.org/online/oyster-card-voter-id/) for the two types of cards which can certainly be discussed - but the survey I'm took the above numbers from certainly didn't include that nuance.\n\nThe [Electoral Reform Society](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/campaigns/voter-id/) has similar concerns. As does the [Joseph Rowntree Foundation](https://www.jrf.org.uk/political-mindsets/the-government-must-not-disenfranchise-low-income-voters-at-the-polls) who, focusing on the economic dimension of privilege, wrote that:\n\n>...there is a very real risk that the Government’s Elections Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will disenfranchise around 1.7 million voters living on a low income.\n\nAnd note that making available an option to get a \"free\" photo ID is no panacea:\n\n>It’s not easy, or necessarily going to be a priority, to apply to your local authority for a free Voter Card if you’re working in an insecure job with irregular, unpredictable and long hours, or juggling multiple jobs to make ends meet while also managing caring responsibilities and health needs. It’s also much harder to apply for a free Voter Card if you don’t have access to technology, or if previous interactions with your local council or job centre have created a feeling of fear and mistrust of the system.\n\nThe same article notes that other organisations such as Crisis, Operation Black Vote and The Runnymede Trust have similar concerns.\n\nIn any case, our voter ID law appears to be targeting a basically non-existent problem. Sure, any motivated media organisation will likely be able to find (or conjure up) a handful of individual stories of people that seemingly got away with defrauding the system. But an analysis of elections held in 2019 showed just how rare electoral fraud of the nature this law sets out to reduce seems to be. \n\nAs far as I can see from [the Electoral Commission's figures](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/research-reports-and-data/electoral-fraud-data/2019-electoral-fraud-data) there were a whole 2 people convicted or cautioned for using someone else's identity in order to vote in a way that this kind of voter ID law could potentially have perhaps prevented.

				"content_text": "[Amazon Kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle) provides a popular, easy-to-use, and (sometimes) cheap ecosystem of devices and books for anyone who enjoys reading eBooks. Of course they are also not the most ethical of companies which might make the proposition entirely unattractive to you - which is not a topic I'll deal with here. However their monopolistic ways are such that many folk end up with a stash of Kindle ebooks they bought.\n\nOne problem though is that Kindle books are (usually) encrypted with [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management). This means that whilst they open smoothly on Kindle devices, Kindle apps and the Kindle Reader website they won't work anywhere else. You can't switch to a different ereader device, a different app or read them on an operating system that doesn't have the app (except perhaps via the web). \n\nFurthermore presumably if you lose access to your Amazon account then you've also lost all your books. That's presumably unlikely to happen most of people, but there are [plenty](https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/tpqyap/amazon_blocked_my_account_and_ive_lost_access_to/) of [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13ee4x5/amazon_closed_account_lost_thousands_of_ebooks/) on the internet of people this has apparently happened to.\n\nAnd it's not absolutely unheard of for Amazon to magically make a book you thought you purchased vanish. Famously, people woke up one day to find that the copy of George Orwell's book '[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)' of all things - you know, the one about how the government retrospectively rewrites history by changing the digital records of what happened - [had vanished,](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-secretly-removes-1984-from-the-kindle-5317703) from the Amazon store and their own Kindles.

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781119741763\">Becoming a Data Head</a> by Alex J Gutman and Jordan Goldmeier.</p>\n<p>This book is a nice mix of layperson and a certain amount of technical content, all on the subject of using data. It&rsquo;s primarily focused on the uses of data in the workplace.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not going to teach you the intricacies of statistics - although it does introduce some useful concepts it&rsquo;d be helpful to understand just to navigate one&rsquo;s way through everyday life - nor how to construct cutting-edge AI models. But you probably will come away understanding more about how those things work and their limitations. As well as, probably more importantly for the  target audience of this book - business people, executives, engineers or novice/wannabe data scientists -  when and why you should consider using these kind of techniques, or, if you&rsquo;re managing people or processes, when to permit someone use them on your behalf.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s thus frequently more about the mindset of data work than the technical details of it. When should you use data? What makes a project worth embarking on? When should you abandon it? And how should you react when folk present the results of their data projects to you?</p>\n<p>The book is organised in to 4 sections, which give an idea of the trajectory readers will be following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Thinking like a Data Head</li>\n<li>Speaking like a Data Head</li>\n<li>Understanding the Data Scientist&rsquo;s toolbox</li>\n<li>Ensuring success</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The last one there is mostly referring to success of the data projects you or your colleagues may embark on.</p>\n<p>So what then is a &ldquo;Data Head&rdquo;, that thing they want you to become?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;these are data skeptics, although the skepticism is based on employing their data critical-thinking skills rather than just to be annoying.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [Becoming a Data Head](https://micro.blog/books/9781119741763) by Alex J Gutman and Jordan Goldmeier.\n\nThis book is a nice mix of layperson and a certain amount of technical content, all on the subject of using data. It's primarily focused on the uses of data in the workplace. \n\nIt's not going to teach you the intricacies of statistics - although it does introduce some useful concepts it'd be helpful to understand just to navigate one's way through everyday life - nor how to construct cutting-edge AI models. But you probably will come away understanding more about how those things work and their limitations. As well as, probably more importantly for the  target audience of this book - business people, executives, engineers or novice/wannabe data scientists -  when and why you should consider using these kind of techniques, or, if you're managing people or processes, when to permit someone use them on your behalf. \n\nIt's thus frequently more about the mindset of data work than the technical details of it. When should you use data? What makes a project worth embarking on? When should you abandon it? And how should you react when folk present the results of their data projects to you?\n\nThe book is organised in to 4 sections, which give an idea of the trajectory readers will be following:\n1. Thinking like a Data Head\n2. Speaking like a Data Head\n3. Understanding the Data Scientist's toolbox\n4. Ensuring success\n\nThe last one there is mostly referring to success of the data projects you or your colleagues may embark on.\n\nSo what then is a \"Data Head\", that thing they want you to become?\n\n>...these are data skeptics, although the skepticism is based on employing their data critical-thinking skills rather than just to be annoying. They advocate for data where it's useful, but question what ought to be questioned. Their skepticism comes from having technical knowledge and domain expertise. It's delivered with empathy.\n\nTheir very reasonable claim is that using data for the sake of using data is not a great use of anyone's resources, no matter what the hype says. Rather:\n\n>To be an effective Data Head you must use data to drive change. \n\nAnd some things simply aren't possible no matter how much you want them to be. Let's never forget the famous phrase:\n\n>Garbage in, garbage out\n\nThis, according to the book, is especially the case with some of the fancier data techniques - if you are not a company with the unbelievable amounts of data, skilled personnel and other resources that say Google has, be more than a little cautious about believing that you can produce what they produce.\n\nBut almost certainly there are ways you and your organisation can productively use data. After all, the book proclaims that data may be the most important part of your job, whether or not you want it to be. You just need to distinguish productive avenues of inquiry from red herrings.\n\nThe book is impressively concise, and a pretty easy read if you have any familiarity with the topic. Along the way there are plenty of checklists and lists of good questions to ask at all phases of any data project, from conception to conclusion.\n\nI can see these being useful for more knowledgeable data workers in addition to the target audience - the sort of people who already know their field well in terms of technical details, but also in some cases may risk getting carried away with their urge to spend time and money having fun with the latest and greatest algorithms on a project that never really stood a chance of working in the first place. \n\nAs an example, before starting on a data project the authors implore you to ask:\n\n- Why is this problem important? If your answer focuses on the methodology or the deliverables involved them you're probably missing the point of the question.\n- Who does this problem affect? Can they actually use the results you'll get? How will their job change?\n- What if we don't have the right data?\n- When is the project over?\n- What if we don't like the results? Meaning that the project went well, but produced an answer the stakeholders didn't want.\n\nThe last point is one I have often wished more folk consider than apparently do\n\nOverall, the book helps you ask better questions, both of yourself and of others. There's also a handy list of pitfalls later on in the book that are a good reference for checking your own work and (politely) challenging that of others.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/e24eb68001.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Cover of Becoming a Data Head book\">\n",

Previously I&rsquo;d assumed that the broken UK housing market is essentially a problem of supply and that we should basically get over our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY\">NIMBYism</a> and build, build, build. That still feels like it would be a good idea, and actually attracts mainstream <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61407508\">political</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-new-homes-target-green-belt\">support</a> these days, at least <a href=\"https://theweek.com/news/politics/960776/rise-of-the-nimby-party-the-tory-house-building-dilemma\">to some extent</a>.</p>\n<p>But apparently the statistical evidence isn&rsquo;t tremendously in favour of this being the only, or perhaps even primary, problem. The ratio homes to households has actually grown over the past 25 years. And it&rsquo;s not an especially bad ratio compared to other countries, the UK having about the average homes per capita for an OECD country, 468 per 1000 people in 2019.</p>\n<p>So perhaps a large part of it is also a problem of legislation. Houses are simply getting into the hands of the wrong people. If so, then the argument goes that what we really need is some far less friendly policies when it comes to (private) landlordism.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me that people&rsquo;s homes should really ever be investment vehicles. They should be high quality, decent and healthful to live in.

Previously I'd assumed that the broken UK housing market is essentially a problem of supply and that we should basically get over our [NIMBYism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) and build, build, build. That still feels like it would be a good idea, and actually attracts mainstream [political](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61407508) [support](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-new-homes-target-green-belt) these days, at least [to some extent](https://theweek.com/news/politics/960776/rise-of-the-nimby-party-the-tory-house-building-dilemma). \n\nBut apparently the statistical evidence isn't tremendously in favour of this being the only, or perhaps even primary, problem. The ratio homes to households has actually grown over the past 25 years. And it's not an especially bad ratio compared to other countries, the UK having about the average homes per capita for an OECD country, 468 per 1000 people in 2019.  \n\nSo perhaps a large part of it is also a problem of legislation. Houses are simply getting into the hands of the wrong people. If so, then the argument goes that what we really need is some far less friendly policies when it comes to (private) landlordism. \n\nIt's not clear to me that people's homes should really ever be investment vehicles. They should be high quality, decent and healthful to live in. That may not be compatible with unbridled capitalism in a country of [great economic inequality](https://equalitytrust.org.uk/scale-economic-inequality-uk).\n",

Come on, it's been at least two decades since [The Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(2002_film)) taught us the perils of that path.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781035409891\">The Abuse of Power</a> by Theresa May.</p>\n<p>It may, astonishingly, be four Prime Ministers ago,  but British folk might still vaguely remember the tenure of PM <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May\">Theresa May</a>. If not, maybe such trigger-words as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_invocation_of_Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union\">Article 50</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_hostile_environment_policy\">Hostile Environment</a>&rdquo; will bring her back to memory. RIP her tenure which somehow only ended 5 years ago despite the number of, umm, &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ve had since then.</p>\n<p>Anyway, she wrote a book. Not an autobiography, or at least not a conventional one. It&rsquo;s a book about some of the various abuses of power she encountered in her political career; the events concerned, a theory of why they happened and how we can stop them happening.</p>\n<p>How should we define an abuse of power? She goes with the definition of any occasion when the abusers concerned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;chose not to use their power in the interests of the powerless, but rather to serve themselves or to protect the institution to which they belonged</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The stakes are not low. As she rightly claimed, by those in charge doing otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;lives have been damaged and sometimes destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She provides plenty of important examples of exactly that. Seeing the chapter titles might convey some idea of what kind of abuses of power we&rsquo;re discussing, so I&rsquo;ll list them below.</p>\n<p>She divides the bulk of the case studies up into three sections.</p>\n<p>The first concerns inappropriate exertions within the British political sphere - &ldquo;Power and politics&rdquo;.  The chapters in this section are as follows. The ramblings after the hyphens are my additions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parliamentary abuse - abuse of procedure, people, trust and the like.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit\">Brexit</a> - no, not its existence or circumstances in which the vote took place, of course not. She&rsquo;s very much &ldquo;will of the people&rdquo; and all that bunkum. Rather the chapter more focussed on any efforts to alter its implementation from her personal vision of what would work well as being abuses, whether from the Remainer or Extreme Brexiteer side. Somewhat remarkably, her take basically seems to boil down to that anyone that disagreed with her must be putting their own interests over the national interest.</li>\n<li>Social media - really as an enabler. Not doing more to remove offensive posts and vicious commentators an example of an abuse of power in her view. I can imagine many people who would find that open to debate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second batch of power abuses are considered to be topics of &ldquo;Social injustice&rdquo;. These seem more straightforwardly defined and, I hope, less debatable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster\">Hillsborough</a> - the 1989 football stadium disaster where people died as a result of being crushed in a crowd.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primodos\">Primodos</a> - a hormone based pregnancy test from the 1960s-70s that turned out to be associated with later severe birth defects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire\">Grenfell</a> - the 2017 fire that broke out a block of flats that led substantially more than 100 deaths and injuries.</li>\n<li>Child sexual abuse</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal\">Rotherham</a> - by which she means more of the previous topic, but this time the specific cases that took place at the hands of &ldquo;grooming gangs&rdquo; in  Rotherham from the 1980s up to the 2010s</li>\n<li>Stop and Search - as carried out by the British police.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Daniel_Morgan\">Daniel Morgan</a> - the investigation into the murder of a private investigator of that name.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_scandal\">Windrush</a> - the starting-2018 scandal whereby immigrant British citizens from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_African-Caribbean_people#The_.22Windrush_generation.22\">Windrush generation</a>, many of whom had come from Britain&rsquo;s at-the-time <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony\">colonies</a> to mainland Britain at the invitation of the government in order to help rebuild the country after the second world war, were wrongly punished, including in some cases even being deported from the UK, supposedly because they could not provide evidence that they should be in Britain.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_21st_century\">Modern Slavery</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we move back to more explicit politics - although politics are of course pervasive in all the mentioned abuses so the division might be a little artificial. But this time the geographic scope is wider - &ldquo;The International Scene&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Power on the World Stage</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal\">The Salisbury Poisonings</a> - in which UK residents Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok (almost certainly?) at the hands of Russian state assassins.</li>\n<li>Afghanistan - a lot of this is about the admittedly pretty catastrophic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_U.S._troop_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan\">US withdrawal</a> in 2020-2021. Again though, I imagine some people would argue with the framing of it in this.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\">Ukraine and Putin</a> - Putin&rsquo;s ongoing illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,  primarily the effort that started in 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all important stories that we everyone should know about. Some of them continue to dip in and out of the new cycle today. Others are far more often forgotten, but shouldn&rsquo;t be. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana\">Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it</a>&rdquo;, and so on. Although her takes on what exactly the abuse in each situation is can at times may seem a bit inconsistent. I&rsquo;m not sure that Putin invading Ukraine is really. the same type of thing as Speaker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bercow\">John Bercow</a> - who she appears to loathe, terming him a bully and a liar, uncharacteristically strong words - interpreting certain parliamentary polices a bit differently to how she would.</p>\n<p>Ignoring that the the somewhat blatant grudge-bearing for one moment, her diagnosis very reasonably seems to be that what abuses of power have in common are that they tend to include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A powerful person, group or institution who prioritises protecting themselves, defending their own existence and good reputation over the needs of those who become victims of abuse correctly and fairly. They do this &ldquo;because they can&rdquo;, an oft-repeated phrase in the book.</li>\n<li>And victims who are typically  ignored, looked down upon, patronised and just generally not treated at all humanely. This of course means that poorer folk, people of colour, immigrants, and so on are over-represented on the victim side. These people with little power, resources or oftentimes respect from the nation are ripe for sacrifice on the alter of protecting the reputation and position of <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/great-and-the-good\">the supposed Great and and the Good</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are good, reliable, and all-to-prevalent rules of thumb. It&rsquo;s just that, to borrow another phrase that is repeatedly used in the book, &ldquo;all too often&rdquo; I think one could say she has been in a position of responsibility for the commission of abuses herself.</p>\n<p>The book goes out of its way to explicitly say something to the effect of &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t about me making excuses for what I did or trying to avoid responsibility, definitely not&rdquo; several times - I think it&rsquo;s even the first line of the back cover. But to be honest it does in part really does come across that way to me, particularly in the abuses of the political domain. Sure, there are nods at apologies for her own misdeeds or bad thought processes, but they read to me as rather lackluster or of a downplaying nature. Perhaps even the sort of thing one says when asked what their weaknesses are in a job interview: &ldquo;&hellip;I have been seen as being too careful&hellip;&rdquo; et al.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, she rarely passes up an opportunity to drag Labour and other non-Conservative parties into the fray. She seems to feel a particular enmity for John Bercow. To be fair she isn&rsquo;t entirely factional; her views of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> are clearly not favourable, nor for the No-Deal Brexiteers on the right. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> is also correctly on the naughty list, as is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\">Donald Trump</a> (who these days certain factions of the Conservative party <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/the-conservative-leadership.html\">appear to be big fans of</a>).</p>\n<p>But rarely does she appear to accept all that much responsibility for her own inevitable part in some of either these ad other abuses. The Windrush scandal, for instance, which most certainly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hostile-environment-policy-theresa-may-migrants-windrush-a8315806.html\">came to fore during her time in high politics</a>, she&rsquo;s at pains to point out that it could have, should have, been solved by all the other governments that came before her. Especially the Labour ones. After all there have been 27 different home secretaries from 1948 until she took the position. Sure, any one of them <em>could</em> have put measures in place to pre-solve the potential problem, but it wasn&rsquo;t really until her &ldquo;hostile environment&rdquo; administration that it became such a life-destroying issue. I&rsquo;m not all that amazed Clement Atlee overlooked that possible future 75+ years ago - not of course that <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/the-unwanted-the-secret-windrush-files-winston-churchill-generation-scandal-racism-296205\">his contribution</a> to the absolute lack of welcome and racism some of that generation received should be overlooked.</p>\n<p>I felt there was rather scant mention of the time she carefully timed an unnecessary general election - three years before the 2020 expected date - just a year after saying that she would certainly not do such a thing. Why? Well, seemingly her decision was driven by the impression that the polls showed that her party would at that moment in time win unfettered power over all government opposition - and hence <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40210957\">let her get her personal vision of Brexit through</a>. That decision <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-why-not-win-majority-conservatives-hung-parliament-jeremy-corbyn-labour-ashcroft-poll-tory-party-tories-a7783101.html\">backfired, badly</a>). And no mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-suspended-over-sex-allegations-reinstated-for-confidence-vote\">her restoring the Conservative whip</a> to a couple of MPs that were under investigation for sexually inappropriate conduct essentially in order to boost the population of MPs that were guaranteed to vote in favour of her in a no-confidence vote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/review-theresa-may-abuse-power-fraser-nelson/\">One review</a> notes that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May’s book is not, really, about her. It’s a reflection on the failings of others and what led them to make the mistakes they did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now to her solution to the abuse of power. It&rsquo;s mainly that we should recruit politicians and other people that are to be put in positions of power who are simply more dedicated to serving the public rather than reigning down megalomaniac power on them. To &ldquo;consign the abuse of power to the past&rdquo; we need to elect politicians who put &ldquo;the common good above personal interest&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The solution chapter is itself called &ldquo;The Answer is Service&rdquo;. We need leaders who are motivated by serving others, not their own interests For politicians it might mean, for instance, emphasising the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2\">Nolan Principles</a> - the first of which specifically refers to serving the interest of the public - during recruitment and throughout their careers. This is all good - who could disagree? - but I feel like we could do with a plan a little more specific, a little more practical,  than simply &ldquo;replace the Bad People with Good People&rdquo;. After all, the party of Boris Johnson - one of the Bad People - was elected to run country by virtue of a public vote; one with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win\">a far more convincing result</a> than the one she takes as reflecting the wholesome, good and true &ldquo;will of the people&rdquo; (ugh) when it came to Brexit.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://archive.ph/n2nhs\">less charitable commentators</a> have pointed out a slightly different take of her conclusion would be more like &ldquo;replace all the people I don&rsquo;t like with copies of me&rdquo;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Naturally, we must learn why the abuse of power is so rife in this country. Her diagnosis is simple. Our institutions do not have enough Theresa Mays staffing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether that&rsquo;s fair or not, whether she&rsquo;s right or not, without some kind of undescribed systemic change I don&rsquo;t really see this as being a pragmatic or actionable solution.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

The ramblings after the hyphens are my additions:\n\n- Parliamentary abuse - abuse of procedure, people, trust and the like.\n- [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) - no, not its existence or circumstances in which the vote took place, of course not. She's very much \"will of the people\" and all that bunkum. Rather the chapter more focussed on any efforts to alter its implementation from her personal vision of what would work well as being abuses, whether from the Remainer or Extreme Brexiteer side. Somewhat remarkably, her take basically seems to boil down to that anyone that disagreed with her must be putting their own interests over the national interest.\n- Social media - really as an enabler. Not doing more to remove offensive posts and vicious commentators an example of an abuse of power in her view. I can imagine many people who would find that open to debate. \n\nThe second batch of power abuses are considered to be topics of \"Social injustice\". These seem more straightforwardly defined and, I hope, less debatable.\n\n- [Hillsborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) - the 1989 football stadium disaster where people died as a result of being crushed in a crowd.\n- [Primodos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primodos) - a hormone based pregnancy test from the 1960s-70s that turned out to be associated with later severe birth defects.\n- [Grenfell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire) - the 2017 fire that broke out a block of flats that led substantially more than 100 deaths and injuries.\n- Child sexual abuse \n- [Rotherham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal) - by which she means more of the previous topic, but this time the specific cases that took place at the hands of \"grooming gangs\" in  Rotherham from the 1980s up to the 2010s\n- Stop and Search - as carried out by the British police.\n- [Daniel Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Daniel_Morgan) - the investigation into the murder of a private investigator of that name.\n- [Windrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_scandal) - the starting-2018 scandal whereby immigrant British citizens from the [Windrush generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_African-Caribbean_people#The_.22Windrush_generation.22), many of whom had come from Britain's at-the-time [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony) to mainland Britain at the invitation of the government in order to help rebuild the country after the second world war, were wrongly punished, including in some cases even being deported from the UK, supposedly because they could not provide evidence that they should be in Britain.\n- [Modern Slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_21st_century)\n\nFinally, we move back to more explicit politics - although politics are of course pervasive in all the mentioned abuses so the division might be a little artificial. But this time the geographic scope is wider - \"The International Scene\"\n\n- Power on the World Stage\n- [The Salisbury Poisonings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal) - in which UK residents Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok (almost certainly?) at the hands of Russian state assassins.\n- Afghanistan - a lot of this is about the admittedly pretty catastrophic [US withdrawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_U.S._troop_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan) in 2020-2021. Again though, I imagine some people would argue with the framing of it in this. \n- [Ukraine and Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) - Putin's ongoing illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,  primarily the effort that started in 2022.\n\nThese are all important stories that we everyone should know about. Some of them continue to dip in and out of the new cycle today. Others are far more often forgotten, but shouldn't be. \"[Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana)\", and so on. Although her takes on what exactly the abuse in each situation is can at times may seem a bit inconsistent. I'm not sure that Putin invading Ukraine is really. the same type of thing as Speaker [John Bercow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bercow) - who she appears to loathe, terming him a bully and a liar, uncharacteristically strong words - interpreting certain parliamentary polices a bit differently to how she would.\n\nIgnoring that the the somewhat blatant grudge-bearing for one moment, her diagnosis very reasonably seems to be that what abuses of power have in common are that they tend to include:\n- A powerful person, group or institution who prioritises protecting themselves, defending their own existence and good reputation over the needs of those who become victims of abuse correctly and fairly. They do this \"because they can\", an oft-repeated phrase in the book.\n- And victims who are typically  ignored, looked down upon, patronised and just generally not treated at all humanely. This of course means that poorer folk, people of colour, immigrants, and so on are over-represented on the victim side. These people with little power, resources or oftentimes respect from the nation are ripe for sacrifice on the alter of protecting the reputation and position of [the supposed Great and and the Good](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/great-and-the-good).\n\nThese are good, reliable, and all-to-prevalent rules of thumb. It's just that, to borrow another phrase that is repeatedly used in the book, \"all too often\" I think one could say she has been in a position of responsibility for the commission of abuses herself.\n\nThe book goes out of its way to explicitly say something to the effect of \"this isn't about me making excuses for what I did or trying to avoid responsibility, definitely not\" several times - I think it's even the first line of the back cover. But to be honest it does in part really does come across that way to me, particularly in the abuses of the political domain. Sure, there are nods at apologies for her own misdeeds or bad thought processes, but they read to me as rather lackluster or of a downplaying nature. Perhaps even the sort of thing one says when asked what their weaknesses are in a job interview: \"...I have been seen as being too careful...\" et al.\n\nOn the contrary, she rarely passes up an opportunity to drag Labour and other non-Conservative parties into the fray. She seems to feel a particular enmity for John Bercow. To be fair she isn't entirely factional; her views of [Boris Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson) are clearly not favourable, nor for the No-Deal Brexiteers on the right. [Dominic Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cummings) is also correctly on the naughty list, as is [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) (who these days certain factions of the Conservative party [appear to be big fans of](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/the-conservative-leadership.html)). \n\nBut rarely does she appear to accept all that much responsibility for her own inevitable part in some of either these ad other abuses. The Windrush scandal, for instance, which most certainly [came to fore during her time in high politics](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hostile-environment-policy-theresa-may-migrants-windrush-a8315806.html), she's at pains to point out that it could have, should have, been solved by all the other governments that came before her. Especially the Labour ones. After all there have been 27 different home secretaries from 1948 until she took the position. Sure, any one of them *could* have put measures in place to pre-solve the potential problem, but it wasn't really until her \"hostile environment\" administration that it became such a life-destroying issue. I'm not all that amazed Clement Atlee overlooked that possible future 75+ years ago - not of course that [his contribution](https://inews.co.uk/news/the-unwanted-the-secret-windrush-files-winston-churchill-generation-scandal-racism-296205) to the absolute lack of welcome and racism some of that generation received should be overlooked. \n\nI felt there was rather scant mention of the time she carefully timed an unnecessary general election - three years before the 2020 expected date - just a year after saying that she would certainly not do such a thing. Why? Well, seemingly her decision was driven by the impression that the polls showed that her party would at that moment in time win unfettered power over all government opposition - and hence [let her get her personal vision of Brexit through](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40210957). That decision [backfired, badly](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-why-not-win-majority-conservatives-hung-parliament-jeremy-corbyn-labour-ashcroft-poll-tory-party-tories-a7783101.html)). And no mention of [her restoring the Conservative whip](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-suspended-over-sex-allegations-reinstated-for-confidence-vote) to a couple of MPs that were under investigation for sexually inappropriate conduct essentially in order to boost the population of MPs that were guaranteed to vote in favour of her in a no-confidence vote.\n\n[One review](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/review-theresa-may-abuse-power-fraser-nelson/) notes that:\n\n>May’s book is not, really, about her. It’s a reflection on the failings of others and what led them to make the mistakes they did.\n\nNow to her solution to the abuse of power. It's mainly that we should recruit politicians and other people that are to be put in positions of power who are simply more dedicated to serving the public rather than reigning down megalomaniac power on them. To \"consign the abuse of power to the past\" we need to elect politicians who put \"the common good above personal interest\". \n\nThe solution chapter is itself called \"The Answer is Service\". We need leaders who are motivated by serving others, not their own interests For politicians it might mean, for instance, emphasising the [Nolan Principles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2) - the first of which specifically refers to serving the interest of the public - during recruitment and throughout their careers. This is all good - who could disagree? - but I feel like we could do with a plan a little more specific, a little more practical,  than simply \"replace the Bad People with Good People\". After all, the party of Boris Johnson - one of the Bad People - was elected to run country by virtue of a public vote; one with [a far more convincing result](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win) than the one she takes as reflecting the wholesome, good and true \"will of the people\" (ugh) when it came to Brexit.\n\nSome [less charitable commentators](https://archive.ph/n2nhs) have pointed out a slightly different take of her conclusion would be more like \"replace all the people I don't like with copies of me\". \n\n>Naturally, we must learn why the abuse of power is so rife in this country. Her diagnosis is simple. Our institutions do not have enough Theresa Mays staffing them.\n\nWhether that's fair or not, whether she's right or not, without some kind of undescribed systemic change I don't really see this as being a pragmatic or actionable solution. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/tm.jpg\" width=\"325\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Book cover for The Abuse of Power\">\n",

ERP is not Enterprise Resource Planning in this world, it&rsquo;s Erotic Roleplay - so intimate conversations, sexting, NSFW images, that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>The kind of thing in fact that Replika explicitly advertised itself as offering via its AI chatbots. I don&rsquo;t have a Replika account to confirm with but apparently there were explicit wife and girlfriend modes, as well as friend modes. They advertised role-play, flirting, NSFW pictures from your &ldquo;AI Girlfriend&rdquo;. You could even (virtually) marry your AI companion.</p>\n<p>Replika advertised itself as being a service for this. They encouraged users to chat regularly, to emotionally and psychologically invest in this digital friend who, unlike ChatGPT et al, was specifically designed give the impression of caring about you.</p>\n<p>From one of their adverts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you feel like you have no one to talk to - meet the world&rsquo;s first AI friend. Replika is here to chat about anything, anytime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So whatever your feelings are about whether these services are healthy, useful, and should exist or not, the point is that it did exist. It was allowed. It was promoted. It was promised. They tried to convince you.</p>\n<p>Back to Gio:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having this emotional investment wasn’t off-label use, it was literally the core service offering. You invested your time and money, and the app would meet your emotional needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It  turns out that ERP modes, sexual or otherwise, appealed to a lot of its customers. It&rsquo;s perhaps not surprising that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern\">the current epidemic of loneliness</a> people turned to them, for better or worse.  And then one day Replika just turned off those abilities, or as Gio terms it, lobotomised them.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a potential financial bait and switch in this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is very, very clearly the case that people were sold this ERP functionality and paid for a year in January only to have the core offering gutted in February.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But also a psychological and emotional one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People just had their girlfriends killed off by policy. Things got real bad. The Replika community exploded in rage and disappointment, and for weeks the pinned post on the Replika subreddit was a collection of mental health resources including a suicide hotline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Suddenly your AI wife simply couldn&rsquo;t express love for you. Some of the testimonials from users that Gio features are quite heart-breaking, even if you don&rsquo;t think this service should ever have existed in the first place.</p>\n<p>For anyone that thinks that having an AI partner is icky, is funny, is to be laughed at, remember that whether or not this service is ethical or should exist - I tend to think it should not, although I don&rsquo;t know the research on this topic -  it did exist. It was promoted, it told vulnerable, lonely people (but not only vulnerable and lonely people) that it would help them lead a happier life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s easy to mock the customers who were hurt here. What kind of loser develops an emotional dependency on an erotic chatbot? First, having read accounts, it turns out the answer to that question is everyone.

That was the entire selling point of the product according to some of its adverts. In any case, what matters is the negative impact that suddenly withdrawing the service without offering customers any sort of support had. An action that makes people feel upset, even suicidal, taken with apparently no care for those most vulnerable, is at least in part bad.</p>\n<p>As Gio notes, probably the real user  &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; here was to trust a company would deliver what it promised. At the end of the day it was a commercial company that was providing a product. The lack of regulation that exists in this new world so far meant they were entirely free to alter or remove the product as they wished without care to its customers, subject to any existing legislation around misleading advertising and the like at least. For all the talk of safety as a rationale for this decision, the end of the day the average company only cares about its users' well-being to the extent that they it&rsquo;s a route to getting investors excited. It&rsquo;s another instantiation of Ezra Klein&rsquo;s real AI alignment problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The corporate double-speak is about how these filters are needed for safety, but they actually prove the exact opposite: you can never have a safe emotional interaction with a thing or a person that is controlled by someone else, who isn’t accountable to you and who can destroy parts of your life by simply choosing to stop providing what it’s intentionally made you dependent on.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>The simple reality is nobody was “unsafe”, the company was just uncomfortable.

Maybe these things are in fact a useful salve for people&rsquo;s lonely lives, although I&rsquo;d hate to see this kind of sticking plaster intervention take the place of a real effort to improve what made us lonely in the first place.</p>\n<p>Not of course that Replika is a on a public health mission, nor would we expect it to be.

Maybe they&rsquo;re a good thing, maybe they&rsquo;re a bad thing, maybe they&rsquo;re good for some people and bad for others. But in this case certainly some users appear to have felt far worse and less safe the day after the decisions was made in comparison to the day before.</p>\n<p>What Gio couldn&rsquo;t have noted in that article, because it happened more recently, was that despite <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3py9j/ai-companion-replika-erotic-roleplay-updates\">statements from the founder</a> saying &ldquo;ERP is not returning&rdquo;, about a year ago naturally <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-chatbot-company-replika-restores-erotic-roleplay-some-users-2023-03-25/\">ERP did return to Replika</a>. At least for the users who had previously been able to access them having signed up before February 2023.  There are plenty of <a href=\"https://metanews.com/problems-with-replika-continue-after-erotic-roleplay-restoration/\">complaints online</a> and particularly in various forums (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/\">Reddit</a>) though that things aren&rsquo;t quite the same, the characters are still diminished, forgetful, and filtered from their prior state.</p>\n<p>And as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s now actually once again open to everyone who can afford the subscription. Certainly the current description in the iOS app store makes out that there are no limits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would heavily urge everyone to not count on the latter statement being even remotely true. The <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> are a far better bet for that.</p>\n",

There are plenty of [complaints online](https://metanews.com/problems-with-replika-continue-after-erotic-roleplay-restoration/) and particularly in various forums (e.g. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/)) though that things aren't quite the same, the characters are still diminished, forgetful, and filtered from their prior state.\n\nAnd as far as I can tell, it's now actually once again open to everyone who can afford the subscription. Certainly the current description in the iOS app store makes out that there are no limits:\n\n>Create your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n>\n>...\n>\n>If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\nI would heavily urge everyone to not count on the latter statement being even remotely true. The [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/) are a far better bet for that.\n",

				"title": "Reliving the story of Britain's shortest-serving Prime Minister with Harry Cole's 'Out of the Blue'",
				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished listening to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780008605780\">Out of the Blue</a> by Harry Cole.</p>\n<p>Cue the obvious jokes about that it must be the world&rsquo;s shortest book - I suppose it actually is on the shortish side for a biography of a Prime Minister to be fair. It seems that the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/blue-review-first-liz-truss-biography-reveals-warnings-ignored/\">Telegraph&rsquo;s suggestion</a> that first draft of the book was submitted with the original subtitle &ldquo;The inside story of the unexpected rise of Liz Truss&rdquo; before a matter of days later it became critical <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/20/liz-truss-biographers-scrambling-to-update-book-17608143/\">to add</a> &ldquo;and rapid fall&rdquo; is real. Indeed, you can still find images of the book with both titles out there.</p>\n<p>It seems thorough and well-researched enough but I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a tremendous number of revelations held within it that anyone who kept somewhat on top of British political news in recent years wouldn&rsquo;t already know. Oddly, it misses out one or two bits and pieces that even very casual observers might have come across; the lack of explicit reference to <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/15/a-friend-informs.html\">the Daily Star livestream of a decaying lettuce</a> being one that caught my attention (although it&rsquo;s very gently hinted at in the intro - that her &ldquo;seven days in control&rdquo; is &ldquo;&hellip;.the shelf-life of a lettuce&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>But if you too want to relive the highs and lows of Britain&rsquo;s record-breaking shortest tenure Prime Minister from childhood through to political demise, then this book might satisfy you.</p>\n<p>Famously she was an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in her youth. Here&rsquo;s the famous vid of her youth politicking.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Her premiership ended up being disrupted by the sad <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-ii.html\">death of the Queen</a>, leading to one of the finer lines in the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Within a week of the last leadership hustings at Wembley, the one-time teenage republican was kissing the hand of Queen Elizabeth II. Two days later, the beloved Monarch was dead;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let the correlation vs causation debate break forth!</p>\n<p>Truss' upbringing was decidedly left-wing. Her mother even moved to try out the communist lifestyle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In spite of her upbringing as the privately educated granddaughter of a capitalist mill boss, Priscilla was clearly sympathetic to the Marxist cause. After spending time in Prague in the early 1960s, and with a babe in arms, she upped sticks to ‘try out life under the communists’ in 1977.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Life under the communists didn&rsquo;t last long though, for either mother or daughter.</p>\n<p>Whilst her mother retains many of her leftist ideals, Liz Truss comes across as have being as obsessionally wedded to the idea that free markets will solve all of life&rsquo;s ills from the very start, whilst taxes are the devil&rsquo;s work in all their forms. I think she&rsquo;s a true believer, to give her credit, unlike many of her purely-populist libertarian-when-it-suits peers.</p>\n<p>When Truss started campaigning in the early 200s it did put her mother in a tricky situation though, a battle between the personal and the political.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it wasn’t an easy decision for Priscilla Truss, according to a former neighbour, after Liz stood again in 2005. ‘She said she was quite torn. She’d agonised over whether to support her because she was her daughter, or not to support her because she was a Tory. In the end, she decided that family ties should win out.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Her father did not campaign with her.</p>\n<p>Liz seemingly showed great ambition, a tireless fervor and the ability to remain committed to a cause no mater what obstacle or person gets in her way. That, for both the pursuit of her political and personal career goals. No setback was too much for her to come back from. I recall the vibes of even her resignation speech and associated interviews as somehow exuding some  &ldquo;I was right, everyone else is just too stupid to understand&rdquo; energy. Certainly her <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/09/15/liz-truss-is.html\">book-promo interview</a> in <a href=\"https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-12499369/Liz-Truss-reveal-inside-story-49-day-premiership-new-book-including-meeting-Queen-just-hours-monarch-died.html\">the Mail on Sunday</a> claimed that &ldquo;the fundamental problem was there wasn’t enough support for Conservative ideas&rdquo; - but of course it&rsquo;s the support that&rsquo;s the problem, not the ideas. Hmm.</p>\n<p>This sheer amount of determination, resilience and energy to move forward is surely extremely useful for the successful pursuit of goals - it&rsquo;s just a shame her goals weren&rsquo;t something more bearable.</p>\n<p>There were nonetheless some aspects of Truss that I hadn&rsquo;t fully appreciated. But those were more on her personal life and her style rather than her well-documented political accomplishments and failures. I hadn&rsquo;t understood how obsessed she was with social media, especially Instagram. Call me old but I don&rsquo;t tend to follow politicians on Insta. But she apparently put some real influencer effort in, continuously focusing on getting the perfect shot even at the expense of tremendous amounts of her team&rsquo;s time, and in some cases her actual job of attending meetings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The next stop in Sydney would become a defining image of Truss’s boosterist style of promoting both Brexit Britain and herself. With the rain still pouring, it took many, many goes to get the final snap of Truss on a British-made Brompton bike with a Union flag umbrella in a car park under Sydney Harbour bridge, with the opera house looming large. Freedom of Information requests would later reveal a £1,483 freelance photographer was hired for the trip – but the picture went around the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know you&rsquo;re dying to see the results, so:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>She also seems to have been something of a party animal, fueling her days with espresso and her nights with alcohol. Unlike some of her retinue she somehow appeared to be frequently able to pull off something vaguely day&rsquo;s work after a night at the clubs though. Not always though, which caused its own problems:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The drinking began at the airport and continued on the plane … her main advisers drank two bottles of champagne on a four-hour flight. On the ground the FS [Foreign Secretary] would drink well past midnight … and be incapable of working the next day. On several trips, Truss would cancel/attempt to cancel important parts of her programme, alienating foreign representatives, due to her hangover or to restart the party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly it does sound like a pretty fun lifestyle, I&rsquo;m kind of jealous.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished listening to [Out of the Blue](https://micro.blog/books/9780008605780) by Harry Cole. \r\n\r\nCue the obvious jokes about that it must be the world's shortest book - I suppose it actually is on the shortish side for a biography of a Prime Minister to be fair. It seems that the [Telegraph's suggestion](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/blue-review-first-liz-truss-biography-reveals-warnings-ignored/) that first draft of the book was submitted with the original subtitle \"The inside story of the unexpected rise of Liz Truss\" before a matter of days later it became critical [to add](https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/20/liz-truss-biographers-scrambling-to-update-book-17608143/) \"and rapid fall\" is real. Indeed, you can still find images of the book with both titles out there. \r\n\r\nIt seems thorough and well-researched enough but I'm not sure there's a tremendous number of revelations held within it that anyone who kept somewhat on top of British political news in recent years wouldn't already know. Oddly, it misses out one or two bits and pieces that even very casual observers might have come across; the lack of explicit reference to [the Daily Star livestream of a decaying lettuce](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/15/a-friend-informs.html) being one that caught my attention (although it's very gently hinted at in the intro - that her \"seven days in control\" is \"....the shelf-life of a lettuce\").\r\n\r\nBut if you too want to relive the highs and lows of Britain's record-breaking shortest tenure Prime Minister from childhood through to political demise, then this book might satisfy you.\r\n\r\n Famously she was an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in her youth. Here's the famous vid of her youth politicking.\r\n \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qfg1AQnWIM?si=IaZQu_Se3dWCLmWO\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n  \r\n Her premiership ended up being disrupted by the sad [death of the Queen](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-ii.html), leading to one of the finer lines in the book:\r\n \r\n>Within a week of the last leadership hustings at Wembley, the one-time teenage republican was kissing the hand of Queen Elizabeth II. Two days later, the beloved Monarch was dead;\r\n\r\nLet the correlation vs causation debate break forth!\r\n\r\nTruss' upbringing was decidedly left-wing. Her mother even moved to try out the communist lifestyle.\r\n\r\n>In spite of her upbringing as the privately educated granddaughter of a capitalist mill boss, Priscilla was clearly sympathetic to the Marxist cause. After spending time in Prague in the early 1960s, and with a babe in arms, she upped sticks to ‘try out life under the communists’ in 1977.\r\n\r\nLife under the communists didn't last long though, for either mother or daughter.\r\n\r\nWhilst her mother retains many of her leftist ideals, Liz Truss comes across as have being as obsessionally wedded to the idea that free markets will solve all of life's ills from the very start, whilst taxes are the devil's work in all their forms. I think she's a true believer, to give her credit, unlike many of her purely-populist libertarian-when-it-suits peers. \r\n\r\nWhen Truss started campaigning in the early 200s it did put her mother in a tricky situation though, a battle between the personal and the political.\r\n\r\n> But it wasn’t an easy decision for Priscilla Truss, according to a former neighbour, after Liz stood again in 2005. ‘She said she was quite torn. She’d agonised over whether to support her because she was her daughter, or not to support her because she was a Tory. In the end, she decided that family ties should win out.’\r\n\r\nHer father did not campaign with her.\r\n\r\nLiz seemingly showed great ambition, a tireless fervor and the ability to remain committed to a cause no mater what obstacle or person gets in her way. That, for both the pursuit of her political and personal career goals. No setback was too much for her to come back from. I recall the vibes of even her resignation speech and associated interviews as somehow exuding some  \"I was right, everyone else is just too stupid to understand\" energy. Certainly her [book-promo interview](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/09/15/liz-truss-is.html) in [the Mail on Sunday](https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-12499369/Liz-Truss-reveal-inside-story-49-day-premiership-new-book-including-meeting-Queen-just-hours-monarch-died.html) claimed that \"the fundamental problem was there wasn’t enough support for Conservative ideas\" - but of course it's the support that's the problem, not the ideas. Hmm.\r\n\r\nThis sheer amount of determination, resilience and energy to move forward is surely extremely useful for the successful pursuit of goals - it's just a shame her goals weren't something more bearable.\r\n\r\nThere were nonetheless some aspects of Truss that I hadn't fully appreciated. But those were more on her personal life and her style rather than her well-documented political accomplishments and failures. I hadn't understood how obsessed she was with social media, especially Instagram. Call me old but I don't tend to follow politicians on Insta. But she apparently put some real influencer effort in, continuously focusing on getting the perfect shot even at the expense of tremendous amounts of her team's time, and in some cases her actual job of attending meetings. \r\n\r\n>The next stop in Sydney would become a defining image of Truss’s boosterist style of promoting both Brexit Britain and herself. With the rain still pouring, it took many, many goes to get the final snap of Truss on a British-made Brompton bike with a Union flag umbrella in a car park under Sydney Harbour bridge, with the opera house looming large. Freedom of Information requests would later reveal a £1,483 freelance photographer was hired for the trip – but the picture went around the world.\r\n\r\nI know you're dying to see the results, so:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/img-6191.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"438\" alt=\"Liz Truss with a Union Jack umbrella on a bike\">\r\n\r\nShe also seems to have been something of a party animal, fueling her days with espresso and her nights with alcohol. Unlike some of her retinue she somehow appeared to be frequently able to pull off something vaguely day's work after a night at the clubs though. Not always though, which caused its own problems:\r\n\r\n>The drinking began at the airport and continued on the plane … her main advisers drank two bottles of champagne on a four-hour flight. On the ground the FS [Foreign Secretary] would drink well past midnight … and be incapable of working the next day. On several trips, Truss would cancel/attempt to cancel important parts of her programme, alienating foreign representatives, due to her hangover or to restart the party.\r\n\r\nHonestly it does sound like a pretty fun lifestyle, I'm kind of jealous. If only she wasn't supposed to be doing something fairly important.\r\n\r\nAt one point during her tenure as foreign secretary, she, celebrity-like, apparently insisted on in another environment would surely be termed a rider.\r\n\r\n>...orders were sent ahead to embassies around the world with details of what the Foreign Secretary would expect on a visit:\r\n>\r\n>- Double espressos served in a flat white-sized takeaway cup.\r\n>- No big-brand coffee, independent producers only, except Pret if in the UK.\r\n>- No pre-made or plastic-packed sandwiches – nothing to be served that has not been freshly prepared.\r\n>- Bagels or sushi for lunch – absolutely no mayonnaise on anything, ever.\r\n>- A bottle of Sauvignon Blanc provided in the fridge of any overnight accommodation.\r\n\r\nAnd then it all went wrong. Her focus on only the freest of free markets, libertarianism (one of her children is, of course, called Liberty) and her predilection for ignoring everything anyone else would suggest that didn't perfectly align with her world view led to [a catastrophic time for Britain's economy](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/revealed-the-30bn-cost-of-liz-trusss-disastrous-mini-budget) and a final ousting of its architect, who became [Britain's shortest serving Prime Minister ever](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/20/liz-truss-finally.html) after just 45 days in office. \r\n\r\nIt also introduced (to me) the harshly named economic concept of the moron premium.

				"content_html": "<p>&ldquo;The Internet&rdquo; is just too big and too important to think about as being one thing these days, even if we constrain ourselves to the bits of it that are most popularly used in 2024 (RIP <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)\">Gopher</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">Usenet</a> et al for most people, although I suppose hello <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)\">Gemini</a>?). In considering the impact of things like generative AI, the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/the-end-of-the-social-network\">demise of the original vision</a> of social networks et al I&rsquo;ve found it far more manageable think of the internet as being layered.</p>\n<p>This is a very unoriginal and frosty take. But thinking about what those layers are fixated my attention for a while.</p>\n<p>Probably my favourite viewpoint on it, and certainly the most beautifully illustrated one, is <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s image</a> of &ldquo;our current social internet situation&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>At the top we have the Dark Forest of the &ldquo;clear web&rdquo;. These are your classic websites. The places you usually end up on if you click on the top Google search result, or indeed a lot of Google-owned properties themselves. They&rsquo;re open to almost anyone with a usable internet connection. In fact they&rsquo;re often desperately vying for your attention. For the most part they&rsquo;d in theory be representative of an older, more utopian, vision of the internet - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free\">information wants to be free</a>, everyone <a href=\"https://areomagazine.com/2020/07/09/does-the-internet-still-give-us-a-voice/\">deserves an equal voice</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;now that most citizens have the tools to engage in mass communication, do more of them have a voice in public debate? Has the web made the public sphere more accessible to a greater diversity of voices?</p>\n<p>Many of the web’s early boosters were confident that the answer was yes. Mass media conglomerates would soon dissolve and the net would give rise to an army of Davids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only problem is that we&rsquo;ve ruined it.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">Appleton&rsquo;s writing</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By choosing advertising as the currency that underpins the internet, and then creating algorithms optimised to focus your attention on a particular page within the sprawling morass available in an environment where quantity is more predictably lucrative than quality, we&rsquo;ve ended up in a digital world with where of weirdly worded near-identical sites infused with surveillance trackers between a vomitorium of lurid adverts compete with each other to tell you which mail-order mattress you should buy, invisibly ranked by referral commission, when all you wanted to do was learn how to sleep better. Whilst <a href=\"https://foxprinteditorial.com/2023/05/11/will-ai-replace-writers-it-already-is/\">human writers being replaced</a> by <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/30/cory-doctorow-reminds.html\">very mid AI text generators</a> is a real and important issue, let&rsquo;s not forget that there are an indeterminate number of dissatified human writers who are currently paid to write <em>for</em> the AI algorithms in the first place.</p>\n<p>I think most of the popular social networks, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter et al. largely fit into this bucket. Oftentimes they require you to sign up in order to access what lies beneath. But they&rsquo;re generally open to all. At least all who are happy to sign away a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/20/what-you-really-sign-up-for-when-you-use-social-media.html\">vast and unreadable set of rights</a> - the infamous yet ubiquitous &ldquo;terms and conditions&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Sometimes their content is indexed and algorithmically hoovered up by search engines and, increasingly, faceless AI bots, in the same way that any other website is. Other times their data is a preciously guarded hoard, unavailable to &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;. But as soon as you sign your various rights away, up until the point where they decide they don&rsquo;t want you there any more,  it&rsquo;s all there, searchable, exploitable, demanding your attention irrespective of whether you had actually planned to spend the evening watching people scream at each other about whether a school really did provide litter trays for their students who identified as cats (spoiler: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/urban-myth-litter-boxes-schools-became-gop-talking-point-rcna51439\">they did not</a>) or sing <a href=\"https://time.com/5929245/sea-shanty-tiktok-2021/\">sea shanties</a>.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s little incentive to present your whole, honest, self in these places. Your genuine interest in, say, providing a financially secure life for your family will translate to 6 months of every website you visit featuring adverts for the next <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp\">shitcoin</a> destined to <a href=\"https://unu.edu/press-release/un-study-reveals-hidden-environmental-impacts-bitcoin-carbon-not-only-harmful-product\">pollute the planet</a> until being rug-pulled away from anyone unlucky enough to have been suckered into the promise of a lifetime of financial freedom.</p>\n<p>And if the algorithmised ads don&rsquo;t get you, the polarised populace of the place may. No-one wants to be the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character\">Main Character</a>. Everyone has said something in their lives that if taken entirely out of context and presented in the worst possible light is likely enough for a few million people to hate-scream at you about. And the <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facebook-weighs-your-reactions-more-than-your-likes_n_58b7044ce4b019d36d0fe13c\">&ldquo;here&rsquo;s something that will annoy you&rdquo; algorithms</a> will ensure that they are provided the chance to do so.</p>\n<p>Why &ldquo;Dark Forest&rdquo;? It <a href=\"https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">comes from</a> a parallel <a href=\"https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">Yancey Strickler makes</a> to the amazing sci-fi trilogy (well, I&rsquo;ve only read book 1, but <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/27/everyone-was-right.html\">it was great</a>) &ldquo;<a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540\">The Three-Body Problem</a>&rdquo;. In pondering on why humanity hasn&rsquo;t yet seen all that convincing proof of alien life, Liu Cixin writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why no alien visitors to our planet? Perhaps there are no aliens, or perhaps the inhabitants of the rest of the galaxy just know that to speak out, to make contact, invites only risk, only predation. Why is the open web seemingly populated mostly by adtech infused &lsquo;brands&rsquo; and extremely partial views of the most theoretically enviable parts of every influencer&rsquo;s lifestyle? Not because all the real people actually vanished. We didn&rsquo;t actually turn into one-dimensional caricatures of ourselves.  We&rsquo;re just keeping much of our lives out of the reach of our perceived predators.</p>\n<p>So many netizens have slunk away to the cozy web for some respite. The idea that large &ldquo;open&rdquo; - well, open only in the sense of letting everyone sign up - social networks are there to connect us with the people we know and love for the betterment of all our relationships has <a href=\"https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/social-media-divides-us/\">obviously failed</a>. Many of those not still publicly arguing about whether ivermectin cures 5G or how bad their neighbour&rsquo;s kids are have substantially shifted their focus to places that are less visible, more hidden, less able to have whatever gems of wisdom they contain brutally scraped by Google for it&rsquo;s publisher-damaging, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-featured-answers-aim-to-distill-truthbut-often-get-it-wrong-1510847867\">often inaccurate</a>, &ldquo;answer box&rdquo;, or, in more recent times, by hungry <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/generative-ai-models-are-sucking-data-up-from-all-over-the-internet-yours-included/\">AI bots looking for massive training data</a>.</p>\n<p>In this category we&rsquo;re largely talking about chat services; think WhatsApp groups, Discord, or Slack. Often invite only, rarely searchable from the outer world, and - as yet - less infused by bots, humans acting like bots or optimised advertising. It feels easier and safer to build real relationships here; to say what&rsquo;s on your mind, to talk to people who share your interests.</p>\n<p>The downside of course is that they&rsquo;re generally ephemeral. The wisdom you espouse, the photos of your friends, the stuff you find meaning in there is probably going to have gone, at least in a practical sense, by the time you want to revisit it in the more distant future. Random person X who would have enjoyed hearing what you had to say, but doesn&rsquo;t happen to be signed up to same same channel of the same service at the same time, is probably not going to be able to. People who never knew others like them existed may never find out that they do if their dialogue is restricted to these spaces.</p>\n<p>Information from these spaces is also hard to link to, hard to share with others. Want your friend to see part of a Whatsapp chat or a Discord conversation from a specific channel? Oftentimes sending screenshots, with the commensurate limitations of doing so, is the only practical way. Of course, those same screenshots will themselves become lost over time.</p>\n<p>And if the service becomes unfashionable, too expensive or otherwise annoying for the company who runs it - it&rsquo;s hardly impossible to imagine even the behemoth WhatsApp being shuttered one day by its owner who already had a similar-seeming product <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal\">when they purchased it</a> if they felt like they could get away with it - there&rsquo;s a good chance that everything is lost. This stuff doesn&rsquo;t appear on the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>.  But it&rsquo;s a safer place to be yourself, to reveal your inner workings, to open yourself up in.</p>\n<p>From Yancey Strickler&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1\">Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a>&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Maggie&rsquo;s words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We create tiny underground burrows of Slack channels, Whatsapp groups, Discord chats, and Telegram streams that offer shelter and respite from the aggressively public nature of Facebook, Twitter, and every recruiter looking to connect on LinkedIn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does it work? From <a href=\"https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe\">Venkatesh Rao&rsquo;s formative article</a>, it&rsquo;s all about very human interactions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Between the Dark Forest and Cozy Web exists a hybrid category - information available in entirely open formats to anyone who actively requests it, but largely hidden from those who haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s often unindexed by the web search engines and fairly inaccessible to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know that it exists. Think subscriber-only email newsletters, RSS feeds, that kind of thing. The rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack\">Substack</a> and its competitors have brought email newsletters to the modern consciousness - although Substack  isn&rsquo;t actually the best example here, as its free newsletters are typically archived as openly accessible webpages too. But the general idea of email newsletters has probably been around for a good four decades or so.</p>\n<p>Finally, deep below the Cozy Web, we see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web\">Dark Web</a>. That&rsquo;s somewhere beyond the typical reach of most humans and their bot counterparts. Its content doesn&rsquo;t appear on search engines. Clicking on a link in your basic default home web-browser will not get you there. Rather you&rsquo;d need to get special software and/or authorisation to see it, even if you had a way of knowing it existed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Everything&rsquo;s encrypted. Anonymity is a key value - unlike visiting a surface web, a clear web, website, a darknet site does not know where in the world you&rsquo;re tuning in from if everything is working well. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> is probably the most famous of these systems. If you ever see what appear to be weblinks that end in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion\">.onion</a> then that&rsquo;s a Tor site you&rsquo;ll need a (freely available, one option <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/\">here</a> - and these days easy enough to use) special browser to access.</p>\n<p>This technology clearly has the side effect of making users very hard to police. Thus, unfortunately, much of its content is ethically or legally dubious.</p>\n<p>Moore and Rid&rsquo;s 2016 article <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2016.1142085\">Cryptopolitik and the Darknet</a> included an attempt to analyse the content of thousands of .onion addresses and found that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The results suggest that the most common uses for websites on Tor hidden services are criminal, including drugs, illicit finance and pornography involving violence, children and animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most common commodity they found on sale was pharmaceutical or recreational drugs. The bulk of the finance sites were around Bitcoin-based money laundering, selling stolen credit card details, bank accounts and counterfeit currency. Let&rsquo;s not spell out what&rsquo;s encompassed in the third category above.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/09/guide-dark-webs-lighter-side/\">don&rsquo;t get the idea that it&rsquo;s all terrible</a> - Tor and its ilk provides a way to access information from countries that cruelly block its citizens from being able access much of the conventional internet, including from the likes of <a href=\"https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2023/12/amnesty-international-website-launches-on-tor-network-to-help-universal-access/\">Amnesty International</a> . Big news sites like the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50150981\">BBC</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2022/may/30/guardian-launches-tor-onion-service\">The Guardian</a> have a presence. Whistleblowers can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop\">share their information</a> with the organisations who can leverage it to make the world a better place, with a higher level of impunity. And, sad to say, some people reputedly find sourcing the drugs they need for their medical conditions easier via these unofficial channels than the methods that in-the-light society has made available to them.</p>\n<p>Maggie Appleton <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web\">credits</a> Venkatesh Rao for the cozy web terminology.

So much is advertising funded. The more you see it, willingly or otherwise, the more they get paid.</p>\n<p>That leaves the Cozy Web, which within this schema is situated in the bottom right. There is a certain amount of security to navigate. You need a special app (e.g. WhatsApp), an account, maybe even an invite. The content isn&rsquo;t indexed by Google or forced into the faces of unsuspecting &lsquo;X&rsquo; users (or for that matter trivially searchable by malicious X users). But when you&rsquo;re in there, the chat is frequently low risk, stuff that doesn&rsquo;t feel private in the same sense that your medical records do. It might be your friends' groupchat, which is mostly just all that stuff you&rsquo;d banter about IRL if you saw each other a bit more, or your colleagues' thoughtstreams - the digital post-pandemic alternative to the watercooler, sanitised in the same sort of way. All in all, there&rsquo;s no need or active desire to hide this area of the internet from the FBI in the heads of most of its users, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;boringly private&rdquo; to use Rao&rsquo;s description with both the benefits and drawbacks such an environment brings.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "\"The Internet\" is just too big and too important to think about as being one thing these days, even if we constrain ourselves to the bits of it that are most popularly used in 2024 (RIP [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)), [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) et al for most people, although I suppose hello [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))?). In considering the impact of things like generative AI, the [demise of the original vision](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/the-end-of-the-social-network) of social networks et al I've found it far more manageable think of the internet as being layered.\n\nThis is a very unoriginal and frosty take. But thinking about what those layers are fixated my attention for a while.\n\nProbably my favourite viewpoint on it, and certainly the most beautifully illustrated one, is [Maggie Appleton's image](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest) of \"our current social internet situation\".\n\n<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/maggiecw.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"670\" alt=\"Maggie Appleton's visual of our social internet situation\"></a>\n\nAt the top we have the Dark Forest of the \"clear web\". These are your classic websites. The places you usually end up on if you click on the top Google search result, or indeed a lot of Google-owned properties themselves. They're open to almost anyone with a usable internet connection. In fact they're often desperately vying for your attention. For the most part they'd in theory be representative of an older, more utopian, vision of the internet - [information wants to be free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free), everyone [deserves an equal voice](https://areomagazine.com/2020/07/09/does-the-internet-still-give-us-a-voice/).\n\n>...now that most citizens have the tools to engage in mass communication, do more of them have a voice in public debate? Has the web made the public sphere more accessible to a greater diversity of voices?\n>\n> Many of the web’s early boosters were confident that the answer was yes. Mass media conglomerates would soon dissolve and the net would give rise to an army of Davids.\n\nThe only problem is that we've ruined it.\n\nFrom [Appleton's writing](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest):\n\n>Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.\n\nBy choosing advertising as the currency that underpins the internet, and then creating algorithms optimised to focus your attention on a particular page within the sprawling morass available in an environment where quantity is more predictably lucrative than quality, we've ended up in a digital world with where of weirdly worded near-identical sites infused with surveillance trackers between a vomitorium of lurid adverts compete with each other to tell you which mail-order mattress you should buy, invisibly ranked by referral commission, when all you wanted to do was learn how to sleep better. Whilst [human writers being replaced](https://foxprinteditorial.com/2023/05/11/will-ai-replace-writers-it-already-is/) by [very mid AI text generators](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/30/cory-doctorow-reminds.html) is a real and important issue, let's not forget that there are an indeterminate number of dissatified human writers who are currently paid to write *for* the AI algorithms in the first place.\n\nI think most of the popular social networks, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter et al. largely fit into this bucket. Oftentimes they require you to sign up in order to access what lies beneath. But they're generally open to all. At least all who are happy to sign away a [vast and unreadable set of rights](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/20/what-you-really-sign-up-for-when-you-use-social-media.html) - the infamous yet ubiquitous \"terms and conditions\".\n\nSometimes their content is indexed and algorithmically hoovered up by search engines and, increasingly, faceless AI bots, in the same way that any other website is. Other times their data is a preciously guarded hoard, unavailable to \"outsiders\". But as soon as you sign your various rights away, up until the point where they decide they don't want you there any more,  it's all there, searchable, exploitable, demanding your attention irrespective of whether you had actually planned to spend the evening watching people scream at each other about whether a school really did provide litter trays for their students who identified as cats (spoiler: [they did not](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/urban-myth-litter-boxes-schools-became-gop-talking-point-rcna51439)) or sing [sea shanties](https://time.com/5929245/sea-shanty-tiktok-2021/).\n\nThere's little incentive to present your whole, honest, self in these places. Your genuine interest in, say, providing a financially secure life for your family will translate to 6 months of every website you visit featuring adverts for the next [shitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp) destined to [pollute the planet](https://unu.edu/press-release/un-study-reveals-hidden-environmental-impacts-bitcoin-carbon-not-only-harmful-product) until being rug-pulled away from anyone unlucky enough to have been suckered into the promise of a lifetime of financial freedom. \n\nAnd if the algorithmised ads don't get you, the polarised populace of the place may. No-one wants to be the [Main Character](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character). Everyone has said something in their lives that if taken entirely out of context and presented in the worst possible light is likely enough for a few million people to hate-scream at you about. And the [\"here's something that will annoy you\" algorithms](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facebook-weighs-your-reactions-more-than-your-likes_n_58b7044ce4b019d36d0fe13c) will ensure that they are provided the chance to do so.  \n\nWhy \"Dark Forest\"? It [comes from](https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) a parallel [Yancey Strickler makes](https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) to the amazing sci-fi trilogy (well, I've only read book 1, but [it was great](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/27/everyone-was-right.html)) \"[The Three-Body Problem](https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540)\". In pondering on why humanity hasn't yet seen all that convincing proof of alien life, Liu Cixin writes:\n\n>Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.\n\nWhy no alien visitors to our planet? Perhaps there are no aliens, or perhaps the inhabitants of the rest of the galaxy just know that to speak out, to make contact, invites only risk, only predation. Why is the open web seemingly populated mostly by adtech infused 'brands' and extremely partial views of the most theoretically enviable parts of every influencer's lifestyle? Not because all the real people actually vanished. We didn't actually turn into one-dimensional caricatures of ourselves.  We're just keeping much of our lives out of the reach of our perceived predators.\n\nSo many netizens have slunk away to the cozy web for some respite. The idea that large \"open\" - well, open only in the sense of letting everyone sign up - social networks are there to connect us with the people we know and love for the betterment of all our relationships has [obviously failed](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/social-media-divides-us/). Many of those not still publicly arguing about whether ivermectin cures 5G or how bad their neighbour's kids are have substantially shifted their focus to places that are less visible, more hidden, less able to have whatever gems of wisdom they contain brutally scraped by Google for it's publisher-damaging, [often inaccurate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-featured-answers-aim-to-distill-truthbut-often-get-it-wrong-1510847867), \"answer box\", or, in more recent times, by hungry [AI bots looking for massive training data](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/generative-ai-models-are-sucking-data-up-from-all-over-the-internet-yours-included/).\n\nIn this category we're largely talking about chat services; think WhatsApp groups, Discord, or Slack. Often invite only, rarely searchable from the outer world, and - as yet - less infused by bots, humans acting like bots or optimised advertising. It feels easier and safer to build real relationships here; to say what's on your mind, to talk to people who share your interests.\n\nThe downside of course is that they're generally ephemeral. The wisdom you espouse, the photos of your friends, the stuff you find meaning in there is probably going to have gone, at least in a practical sense, by the time you want to revisit it in the more distant future. Random person X who would have enjoyed hearing what you had to say, but doesn't happen to be signed up to same same channel of the same service at the same time, is probably not going to be able to. People who never knew others like them existed may never find out that they do if their dialogue is restricted to these spaces.\n\nInformation from these spaces is also hard to link to, hard to share with others. Want your friend to see part of a Whatsapp chat or a Discord conversation from a specific channel? Oftentimes sending screenshots, with the commensurate limitations of doing so, is the only practical way. Of course, those same screenshots will themselves become lost over time.\n\nAnd if the service becomes unfashionable, too expensive or otherwise annoying for the company who runs it - it's hardly impossible to imagine even the behemoth WhatsApp being shuttered one day by its owner who already had a similar-seeming product [when they purchased it](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal) if they felt like they could get away with it - there's a good chance that everything is lost. This stuff doesn't appear on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).  But it's a safer place to be yourself, to reveal your inner workings, to open yourself up in.\n\nFrom Yancey Strickler's \"[Dark Forest Theory of the Internet](https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1)\":\n\n>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.\n\nIn Maggie's words:\n\n>We create tiny underground burrows of Slack channels, Whatsapp groups, Discord chats, and Telegram streams that offer shelter and respite from the aggressively public nature of Facebook, Twitter, and every recruiter looking to connect on LinkedIn.\n\nHow does it work? From [Venkatesh Rao's formative article](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe), it's all about very human interactions:\n\n>...the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot.\n\nBetween the Dark Forest and Cozy Web exists a hybrid category - information available in entirely open formats to anyone who actively requests it, but largely hidden from those who haven't. It's often unindexed by the web search engines and fairly inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know that it exists. Think subscriber-only email newsletters, RSS feeds, that kind of thing.

Clicking on a link in your basic default home web-browser will not get you there. Rather you'd need to get special software and/or authorisation to see it, even if you had a way of knowing it existed in the first place.\n\nEverything's encrypted. Anonymity is a key value - unlike visiting a surface web, a clear web, website, a darknet site does not know where in the world you're tuning in from if everything is working well. [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) is probably the most famous of these systems.

Thus, unfortunately, much of its content is ethically or legally dubious.\n\nMoore and Rid's 2016 article [Cryptopolitik and the Darknet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2016.1142085) included an attempt to analyse the content of thousands of .onion addresses and found that:\n\n>The results suggest that the most common uses for websites on Tor hidden services are criminal, including drugs, illicit finance and pornography involving violence, children and animals.\n\nThe most common commodity they found on sale was pharmaceutical or recreational drugs. The bulk of the finance sites were around Bitcoin-based money laundering, selling stolen credit card details, bank accounts and counterfeit currency. Let's not spell out what's encompassed in the third category above.\n\nBut [don't get the idea that it's all terrible](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/guide-dark-webs-lighter-side/) - Tor and its ilk provides a way to access information from countries that cruelly block its citizens from being able access much of the conventional internet, including from the likes of [Amnesty International](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2023/12/amnesty-international-website-launches-on-tor-network-to-help-universal-access/) .

Venkatesh himself illustrated his view of the \"complexity of the extended internet universe\" in what I think is his [original post on the matter](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe).\n\n<a href=\"https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/raoweb.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Rao's illustration of the complexity of the extended internet universe\"></a>\n\nThis version, whilst less aesthetically pleasing than Appleton's beautiful illustration - but still nicer than anything I myself could accomplish - holds two dimensions within it.

I now want to read all the author's other books.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/inasc.jpg\" width=\"349\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Book cover for In Ascension\">\n",

He successfully completed a degree in English literature, worked as an English teacher, and worked with NATO troops in Afghanistan, which required passing an English test, before coming to the UK to pursue a business degree which is the point at which he took the Toiec test. He probably speaks better English than I do. Nonetheless he was amongst the crowd that were accused of cheating.\n",

In particularly those that developed as a result of encounters with love, loss, sexuality or death. He developed a talking therapy that aimed to help patients understand and deal with any adverse impact that their resultant unconscious was having on their lives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Freud&rsquo;s theories paint a picture of human beings as internally conflicted, governed by unruly instinctual impulses rather than by reason, and generally lacking self-knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Famously, patients would lie on a couch whilst undergoing their analysis.

				"content_text": "I recently visited the final residence of [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) - the extraordinarily famous father of [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis), he of the [id, ego and super-ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego). It's now the [Freud Museum](https://www.freud.org.uk/).\n\n![A picture of Sigmund Freud](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/53175cf4-3040-4961-95b7-cd44cc97e2a1.jpg \"A picture of Sigmund Freud that hangs in the museum\")\n\nFreud believed that human behaviour is largely determined by unconscious motivations that originate in one's childhood. In particularly those that developed as a result of encounters with love, loss, sexuality or death. He developed a talking therapy that aimed to help patients understand and deal with any adverse impact that their resultant unconscious was having on their lives. \n\n>Freud's theories paint a picture of human beings as internally conflicted, governed by unruly instinctual impulses rather than by reason, and generally lacking self-knowledge.\n\nFamously, patients would lie on a couch whilst undergoing their analysis. The couch itself can be still be seen in the museum.\n\n![Sigmund Freud's couch](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/665faf86-2e2e-41a2-864e-961da8486f2a.jpg \"Sigmund Freud's couch\")\n\nHis final home was in 20 Maresfield Gardens, London.\n\n![Freud's London house](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/7e0fafb2-9c74-4fb3-9607-8ce347b18d53.jpg \"Freud's London house\")\n\nUntil 1938 he lived and practiced his profession in Austria. But when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 he found himself in grave danger. Being both Jewish and a radical thinker he was surely destined for a deadly fate had he not managed to successfully seek refuge in the UK. \n\n>I saw the scientific society I had founded dissolved, our institutions destroyed, our printing press taken over by the invaders, the books I had published confiscated or reduced to pulp, and my children expelled from their professions.\n\nUnfortunately his sisters were not so lucky in terms of getting out, with each of them succumbing to death in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nBut Sigmund made it to England in 1938. He lived only about one year more, dying in 1939. One of his daughters, [Anna Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud), herself a practitioner of psychoanalysis who went on to develop the field of psychoanalytic child psychology, then resided there until her death in 1982.\n\nIt was Anna that set in motion the conversion of their last residence into a public museum, wherein now you can visit both the Freuds' treatment rooms in something akin to their original glory. Sigmund's love of antiquity is apparent with his various collections dotted around his office.\n\n![A panoramic view of Sigmund Freud's office](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2024/img-6034.jpeg \"A panoramic view of Sigmund Freud's office\")\n\nHe appears to have had a particular interest with the [Acropolis of Athens](https://www.freud.org.uk/2000/12/30/a-disturbance-of-memory-on-the-acropolis/).\n",

				"content_html": "<p>(List last updated 2024-10-15, first written 2023-12-29)</p>\n<p>Ever since the generative AI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">chatGPT</a> craze started - it&rsquo;s been <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/chatgpts-one-year-anniversary-how-the-viral-ai-chatbot-has-changed.html\">just over a year since it launched </a>if you can believe that - I&rsquo;ve been looking for some nice meaty but lay-person-adjacent books to help me understand how best to think about the contemporary variant of artificial intelligence hype.</p>\n<p>Not necessarily the technical details, the code underlying the seeming magic  - or at least not only those details. I&rsquo;m interested too in the more more philosophical, more political domains of thought. What will AI do to society? What might it improve, what might it make worse? How best should we consider and handle it to ensure it does more of the former than the latter? Or is it all a tech-bro mirage, nothing more than a technological flash in a pan?</p>\n<p>Whilst the current instantiation of the newer large language model public demos are still new enough that there&rsquo;s likely not been enough time for a huge number of reliable comprehensive-but-approachable books to have been written, it&rsquo;s not like people weren&rsquo;t already thinking about AI from both technical and philosophical viewpoints way before OpenAI came to be.</p>\n<p>The distinct field of what could be called &ldquo;AI studies&rdquo; has been around at least 60 years, depending on how you count it. I certainly was exposed to it at university quite some years ago. Alan Turing was considering whether machines could think <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/artificial-intelligence\">back in 1950</a>.  And people&rsquo;s thoughts and dreams about aspects of future AIs have likely been around far longer - centuries longer -  as cultural artifacts and thought experiments, even if they use <a href=\"https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/12/golems-as-artificial.html\">very different terminology</a>. Undoubtedly there&rsquo;s plenty of very interesting and thoughtful work out there.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a few books that have piqued my interest, mostly culled from various articles or podcasts about AI I must have perused over the past few months. They&rsquo;re not exactly recommendations, as I haven&rsquo;t yet read them. But I hope to do so one day, and would welcome any other suggestions.</p>\n<p>Before the most recent hype cycle I&rsquo;d already read a handful of works on AI. Three of the ones that I felt I got something useful out of were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence\">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a>, by Nick Bostrom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53238793-life-3-0\">Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a>, by Max Tegmark</li>\n<li><a

				"content_text": "(List last updated 2024-10-15, first written 2023-12-29)\n\nEver since the generative AI [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) craze started - it's been [just over a year since it launched ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/chatgpts-one-year-anniversary-how-the-viral-ai-chatbot-has-changed.html)if you can believe that - I've been looking for some nice meaty but lay-person-adjacent books to help me understand how best to think about the contemporary variant of artificial intelligence hype.\n\nNot necessarily the technical details, the code underlying the seeming magic  - or at least not only those details. I'm interested too in the more more philosophical, more political domains of thought. What will AI do to society? What might it improve, what might it make worse? How best should we consider and handle it to ensure it does more of the former than the latter? Or is it all a tech-bro mirage, nothing more than a technological flash in a pan?\n\nWhilst the current instantiation of the newer large language model public demos are still new enough that there's likely not been enough time for a huge number of reliable comprehensive-but-approachable books to have been written, it's not like people weren't already thinking about AI from both technical and philosophical viewpoints way before OpenAI came to be.\n\nThe distinct field of what could be called \"AI studies\" has been around at least 60 years, depending on how you count it. I certainly was exposed to it at university quite some years ago. Alan Turing was considering whether machines could think [back in 1950](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/artificial-intelligence).  And people's thoughts and dreams about aspects of future AIs have likely been around far longer - centuries longer -  as cultural artifacts and thought experiments, even if they use [very different terminology](https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/12/golems-as-artificial.html). Undoubtedly there's plenty of very interesting and thoughtful work out there.\n\nAnyway, here's a few books that have piqued my interest, mostly culled from various articles or podcasts about AI I must have perused over the past few months. They're not exactly recommendations, as I haven't yet read them. But I hope to do so one day, and would welcome any other suggestions.\n\nBefore the most recent hype cycle I'd already read a handful of works on AI. Three of the ones that I felt I got something useful out of were:\n\n- [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence), by Nick Bostrom\n- [Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53238793-life-3-0), by Max Tegmark\n- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction) by Cathy O'Neil\n\nAnyway, here's my basic fantasy to-read list, in no particular order:\n\n{{< bookshelf shelf=\"artificialintelligencetoread\" variant=\"list\">}}\n\n---\n\nAnd now the same list again, but this time with some of the publisher blurb to help give a clue on what they're actually about: \n\n**[God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56097578-god-human-animal-machine) by Meghan O'Gieblyn**\n\n> A strikingly original exploration of what it might mean to be authentically human in the age of artificial intelligence\n> \n> ...\n> \n> For most of human history the world was a magical and enchanted place ruled by forces beyond our understanding.

We have so much to learn, and many worlds to gain.\n\n---\n\n[**The Atomic Human: Understanding Ourselves in the Age of AI](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198283327-the-atomic-human), by Neil D. Lawrence**.\n\n>What does Artificial Intelligence mean for our identity? Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the centre of the world.>>Neil D. Lawrence's visionary book shows why these fears may be misplaced. \n>\n>...\n>\n>By contrasting our capabilities with machine intelligence, The Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just by the experts, but ordinary people. Understanding this will enable readers to choose the future we want – either one where AI is a tool for us, or where we become a tool of AI – and how to counteract the digital oligarchy to maintain the fabric of an open, fair and democratic society.\n\n---\n\n**[AI Needs You: How We Can Change AI's Future and Save Our Own](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154958098-ai-needs-you), by Verity Harding**.\n\n>Artificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI’s power grows, so does the need to figure out what—and who—this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.\n>\n>...\n>\n>History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; to serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.\n\n---\n\n**[The Skill Code: How to Save Human Ability in an Age of Intelligent Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199534421-the-skill-code), by Matt Beane**\n\n> From one of the world’s top researchers on work and technology comes an insightful and surprising guide to protecting your skill in a world filling with AI and robots. Think of your most valuable skill, the thing you can reliably do under pressure to deliver results. How did you learn it? Whatever your job – plumber, attorney, teacher, surgeon – decades of research show that you achieved mastery by working with someone who knew more than you did. Formal learning—school and books—gave you conceptual knowledge, but you developed your skill by working with an expert. Today, this essential bond is under threat. \n>\n> ...\n> \n> Whether you’re an expert or a novice, this book will show you how to build skill more effectively – and how to make intelligent technologies part of the solution, not the problem. \n\n---\n\n**[Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208707460-deep-utopia), by Nick Bostrom**\n\n>Bostrom’s previous book, Paths, Dangers, Strategies changed the global conversation on AI and became a New York Times bestseller. It focused on what might happen if AI development goes wrong. But what if things go right?\n>\n> Suppose that we develop superintelligence safely, govern it well, and make good use of the cornucopian wealth and near magical technological powers that this technology can unlock. If this transition to the machine intelligence era goes well, human labor becomes obsolete. We would thus enter a condition of \"post-instrumentality\", in which our efforts are not needed for any practical purpose. Furthermore, at technological maturity, human nature becomes entirely malleable.\n>\n>Here we confront a challenge that is not technological but philosophical and spiritual. In such a solved world, what is the point of human existence? What gives meaning to life? What do we do all day?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781524742874\">Being You: A New Science of Consciousness</a> by Anil Seth.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This feels like a book that&rsquo;s going to be hard to summarise. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I read most of it a year and a half ago whilst on a sun lounger. But I also found it a fairly dense and complicated book. Although a tome on the subject of &ldquo;what is consciousness and how does it work?&rdquo; could hardly be anything else. A key aspect of the topic is after all colloquially known as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness\">the hard problem</a>&rdquo; - although Seth believes that particular aspect isn&rsquo;t the one that we should be trying to solve in the first place.</p>\n<p>The famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness\">hard problem of consciousness</a>&rdquo; is to figure out why the presumably physical inputs we receive from the external world lead to our inner phenomenological experiences. Why do we experience certain vibrations, in the form of sound waves, as music? Why does that experience of &ldquo;music&rdquo; make us feel things? Sad, happy, warm, awe-struck, or anything else on the wide-ranging human palette of feelings.</p>\n<p>Why does this particular wavelength of light generate the experience of an intense red, and how come it makes us feel relaxed, or on edge? In summary: why does being exposed to physical phenomena make give us an &ldquo;experience&rdquo;? Both as a general question, and also, for a given single input why that experience in particular?</p>\n<p>Seth thinks that&rsquo;s the wrong line of inquiry. He wants us to think about the &ldquo;real problem&rdquo;  of consciousness. By his telling, that means that the goal of science should be to explain, predict and control the phenomenological properties of consciousness. Or as he writes in <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one\">an article for Aeon</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;how to account for the various properties of consciousness in terms of biological mechanisms; without pretending it doesn’t exist (easy problem) and without worrying too much about explaining its existence in the first place (hard problem).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First up, his definition of consciousness. Here it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;any kind of subjective experience&rdquo;. But, importantly, the experiences are indeed subjective.</p>\n<p>We do not perceive things 1:1 as they are. This doesn&rsquo;t take too much introspection to figure out even without the aid of a complicated book. Seth describes our perception of reality as a &ldquo;controlled hallucination&rdquo;.  There are other types of hallucinations - LSD inspired ones for instance. But the shared hallucination that (almost) all of us agree on at a given point in time is the one that we choose to call reality.</p>\n<p>We experience colours when what is actually out there is merely photons. We experience music when what is out there is merely vibrations. There surely is a &ldquo;truth&rdquo; out there, but we have no direct access to it. Rather, our brains create our conscious experience from its inputs. This explains why we can be predictably mistaken about things. Think for instance of visual illusions. The white &amp; gold / black &amp; blue <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress\">dress that broke the Internet</a> a few years ago is an obvious example.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;our perceptual experiences of the world are internal constructions, shaped by the idiosyncrasies of our personal biology and history</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why have we evolved to do this presumably computationally intense and certainly extremely unintuitive hard mental work? Because, of course, it helps us get through life.</p>\n<p>The discomfort we feel when hungry is useful from a survival, and hence evolutionary, point of view. It motivates us to seek out food. Particularly energy dense food that in times gone past would have given us the most survival bang for our buck. The enticing taste of chocolate thus isn&rsquo;t some random weird intrinsic property of its constituent molecules. It serves a function. Our conscious experience of the deliciousness of it motivates us want to seek out and consume it. In that way we can replenish our energy stores, and stay alive.</p>\n<p>Colours provide another useful example. The properties of the light reflected from the same object in dark surroundings compared to well-light surroundings can be dramatically different. The actual stuff that hits our eyeballs - the sensory information - is thus very dependent on our environment. But it suits the way we work in the world for us to understand that it&rsquo;s the same object. We still feel that the blue shirt that we previously saw in the midday sun is blue even when the actual sensory information we receive looking at it in the dusky evening is very different.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We perceive the world not as it is, but as it is useful to us</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The brain can be thought of as a prediction machine that takes the inputs it receives from our senses and produces a guess of what caused those inputs, of what is out there. This is necessary because knowing what is out there in our environment is a fundamental requirement for us to survive. With no way to access raw truth, our brain has evolved the ability to make educated guesses, or, to put it more formally, predictions. Our conscious sense of reality is essentially those predictions.</p>\n<p>Our impression of reality is constantly updated as the brain receives further sensory input. The aim is to reduce prediction errors, likely via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference\">Bayesian reasoning principles</a>.  Our inner &ldquo;reality&rdquo; thus shifts as we subconsciously receive input that is incompatible with our present perception of reality.</p>\n<p>It increases in confidence when the stuff coming in through out sense organs is congruent with our prior beliefs. But, be honest, we&rsquo;re all familiar with having seen or heard something that later turned out to be entirely different from how we perceived it at the time. It&rsquo;s because what we perceive is nothing more than our best guess from incomplete information. It&rsquo;s impossible to guess right every time when you&rsquo;re not omniscient.</p>\n<p>This mechanism can also lead to our many famous biases. The prediction machine side of things is why we&rsquo;re more likely to perceive things that we expect in advance to perceive; yet another phenomenon that makes clear the lack of objectivity in our conscious experience.</p>\n<p>For those who follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle\">active inference theory</a> it might be that the actions we &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to take in the world are those that will minimise our predictive errors. We take actions to confirm that our predictions are true, and when it turns out that they are not then we update our predictions.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of potential implications of this telling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our sense of &ldquo;self&rdquo; is another of these controlled hallucinations, which, amongst other things, explains why it&rsquo;s so hard for philosophers to pin down. The self is a mix of our brain&rsquo;s predictions, beliefs and memories. This explains why people who suffer issues with memory can have their sense of self affected.</li>\n<li>The same with free will. Even the most ardent free will skeptic might admit to having a sense that they have free will even if they objectively do not believe that can be the case. But it&rsquo;s another hallucination, &ldquo;designed&rdquo; to provoke us into behaviour that is to our evolutionary benefit. Even if in reality there was no real possibility that we would have done things differently in the past, the feeling that we could have done so provides a feeling that we&rsquo;re able to do things differently the next time if it suits our survival to do so. We can learn.</li>\n<li>Our emotions don&rsquo;t cause our physical reactions. Rather it&rsquo;s the other way around. Our heart doesn&rsquo;t beat faster because we&rsquo;re scared. We consciously feel fear because our heart is beating faster, and the feeling of fear is a way to motivate us to actions that&rsquo;ll help us survive, such as running away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This leads us to Seth&rsquo;s &ldquo;beast machine theory&rdquo;. For us to survive and thrive, it&rsquo;s important not only to be within a safe external environment, but also that certain interoceptive signals - those received based on our body temperature or heart rate for example - are maintained within certain value ranges.</p>\n<p>If these inner indicators stray into more dangerous territory then the brain provides phenomenological hallucinations, more commonly described as emotions and moods, that provoke us to take actions to return the signals it&rsquo;s receiving back to a normal and safe value.  For us beast machines, regulating our inner-state and integrity is of a higher priority than accurately perceiving things.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a social side of things too. We alter our behaviour based on our perception of what other people might be perceiving about us. Our identities often reflect what other people think of us.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re also capable of learning from and about other entities. And not only those from our own species; most people intuit that at least some animals might be conscious. And in the current AI-enthusiast times, some people wonder whether at some point machines might be too. Seth is skeptical of the latter, although doesn&rsquo;t entirely rule it out.</p>\n<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s important that we do try to figure the parameters of consciousness out - whether the potential experiencer is made of meat, silicon or something else - because as soon as something has consciousness then it gains a moral status such that we should take care to minimise its suffering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For those who prefer videos to books, the author has given a TED talk on the subject too.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

We consciously feel fear because our heart is beating faster, and the feeling of fear is a way to motivate us to actions that'll help us survive, such as running away.\n\nThis leads us to Seth's \"beast machine theory\". For us to survive and thrive, it's important not only to be within a safe external environment, but also that certain interoceptive signals - those received based on our body temperature or heart rate for example - are maintained within certain value ranges.\n\nIf these inner indicators stray into more dangerous territory then the brain provides phenomenological hallucinations, more commonly described as emotions and moods, that provoke us to take actions to return the signals it's receiving back to a normal and safe value.  For us beast machines, regulating our inner-state and integrity is of a higher priority than accurately perceiving things.\n\nThere's a social side of things too. We alter our behaviour based on our perception of what other people might be perceiving about us. Our identities often reflect what other people think of us. \n\nWe're also capable of learning from and about other entities. And not only those from our own species; most people intuit that at least some animals might be conscious. And in the current AI-enthusiast times, some people wonder whether at some point machines might be too. Seth is skeptical of the latter, although doesn't entirely rule it out.\n\nIn any case, it's important that we do try to figure the parameters of consciousness out - whether the potential experiencer is made of meat, silicon or something else - because as soon as something has consciousness then it gains a moral status such that we should take care to minimise its suffering.\n\n>...the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence.\n\nFor those who prefer videos to books, the author has given a TED talk on the subject too.\n\n<div style=\"max-width:854px\"><div style=\"position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/anil_seth_being_you_a_new_science_of_consciousness\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>\n",

				"title": "\"The Extended Mind\" teaches us how to improve our thinking in some counterintuitive ways",
				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780544947665\">The Extended Mind</a> by Annie Murphy Paul.</p>\n<p>This was one of those books that are so fascinating that when I attempt to highlight the interesting bits I find myself highlighting the whole book. I&rsquo;d heard good things about it and it certainly delivered.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s on a topic that&rsquo;s of great import and interest to me - essentially how to think &ldquo;better&rdquo;. It also share a thesis that wasn&rsquo;t entirely intuitive to me in a way that suggests some practical avenues one can easily change one&rsquo;s behaviour in order to improve the output of your cognition. What more could be asked?</p>\n<p>The general idea is that our society has fixated far too much on the idea that the individual brain is the sole locus of thinking, of cognition, of creativity and problem solving.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;brain as computer model&rdquo;, as though we each have a self-contained isolated CPU in our heads that performs our thinking at whatever speed and quality nature saw fit to bestow upon us. That would suggest that aside from sitting at a desk an individually focusing on formal education and training courses, perhaps we could improve our brain&rsquo;s performance by learning new ways to think about things within our brain, some lifehacks, engaging in brain training or supplementation, but that&rsquo;s about it. Intelligence is a &ldquo;fixed lump of something in our heads&rdquo;, and we design our home, schools and workplaces around that idea</p>\n<p>But the author contends that this is all wrong. Modern research has shown that the brain should be thought of more as a magpie. It creates its output out of the materials it finds around it. Thinking uses resources external to the brain, and the nature of the materials available affects the quality of the thinking. Intelligence, as properly considered, isn&rsquo;t fixed, but rather a &ldquo;shifting state&rdquo; that depends on the level of access you have to resources outside of your brain and your ability to leverage them. This book gives you the knowledge to try and improve both of those for yourself and those around you.</p>\n<p>And this is essential work! Modern day life involves absorbing a ton of information, often in abstract forms that we had no reason to evolve to be good at, so we aren&rsquo;t. Many of the challenges and tasks that face us are extremely complex.</p>\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t for nothing that the amount of journal papers and patent applications that have a single author is dwindling over time. At some point much &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; work may have exceeded the natural capability of almost anyone&rsquo;s individual brain, no matter how ensconced in an ivory tower it is.</p>\n<p>The book is grouped into three main sections, each of which deals with a different sphere in which we can consider extending our mind.</p>\n<p>The first is using our bodies, rather than our brains to help us think. We are more than brains on a stick. The second is adapting the environments we reside  in to enable improved thinking. In some ways  the trend in recent times has been to engineer ever worse environments for thinking as time goes on. And the last is to leverage our social natures, to &ldquo;think&rdquo; with our relationships to other people. Groups of people can be more than the sum of their individuals, particularly if proactively designed to work as such.</p>\n<p>The argument is that at present we&rsquo;d be much better served in spending time figuring out how to improve our capabilities in using these external resources than undergoing individual training to improve some personal skill.</p>\n<p>Three sets of general principles arise. The first concerns the &ldquo;habits of mind&rdquo; that we should adopt to improve the output of our thinking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offload information from your brain whenever you can. This could mean anything from writing down your thoughts or &ldquo;socially offloading&rdquo; them to other people.</li>\n<li>Transform information into artefacts, ideally physical ones. Interact with them, tweak them, show them to other people.</li>\n<li>Be proactive in altering your inner state. Take some physical exercise before trying to learn something. Synchronise with others before you attempt group work. Spend time in nature if you have an upcoming creative task.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second set of principles uses our understanding of what the brain evolved to do in order to grasp how mental extension works.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aim to &ldquo;re-embody&rdquo; information. Allow your body&rsquo;s interoceptive signals to influence your choices. Use physical movement to enact concepts. Focus on your gestures and those of others.</li>\n<li>Re-spatialise information when possible. Our brain processes information via mental maps.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [The Extended Mind](https://micro.blog/books/9780544947665) by Annie Murphy Paul.\r\n\r\nThis was one of those books that are so fascinating that when I attempt to highlight the interesting bits I find myself highlighting the whole book. I'd heard good things about it and it certainly delivered.\r\n\r\nIt's on a topic that's of great import and interest to me - essentially how to think \"better\". It also share a thesis that wasn't entirely intuitive to me in a way that suggests some practical avenues one can easily change one's behaviour in order to improve the output of your cognition. What more could be asked?\r\n\r\nThe general idea is that our society has fixated far too much on the idea that the individual brain is the sole locus of thinking, of cognition, of creativity and problem solving.\r\n\r\nIt's the \"brain as computer model\", as though we each have a self-contained isolated CPU in our heads that performs our thinking at whatever speed and quality nature saw fit to bestow upon us. That would suggest that aside from sitting at a desk an individually focusing on formal education and training courses, perhaps we could improve our brain's performance by learning new ways to think about things within our brain, some lifehacks, engaging in brain training or supplementation, but that's about it. Intelligence is a \"fixed lump of something in our heads\", and we design our home, schools and workplaces around that idea\r\n\r\nBut the author contends that this is all wrong. Modern research has shown that the brain should be thought of more as a magpie. It creates its output out of the materials it finds around it. Thinking uses resources external to the brain, and the nature of the materials available affects the quality of the thinking. Intelligence, as properly considered, isn't fixed, but rather a \"shifting state\" that depends on the level of access you have to resources outside of your brain and your ability to leverage them. This book gives you the knowledge to try and improve both of those for yourself and those around you. \r\n\r\nAnd this is essential work! Modern day life involves absorbing a ton of information, often in abstract forms that we had no reason to evolve to be good at, so we aren't. Many of the challenges and tasks that face us are extremely complex.\r\n\r\nIt isn't for nothing that the amount of journal papers and patent applications that have a single author is dwindling over time. At some point much \"interesting\" work may have exceeded the natural capability of almost anyone's individual brain, no matter how ensconced in an ivory tower it is.\r\n\r\nThe book is grouped into three main sections, each of which deals with a different sphere in which we can consider extending our mind.\r\n\r\nThe first is using our bodies, rather than our brains to help us think. We are more than brains on a stick. The second is adapting the environments we reside  in to enable improved thinking. In some ways  the trend in recent times has been to engineer ever worse environments for thinking as time goes on. And the last is to leverage our social natures, to \"think\" with our relationships to other people. Groups of people can be more than the sum of their individuals, particularly if proactively designed to work as such.\r\n\r\nThe argument is that at present we'd be much better served in spending time figuring out how to improve our capabilities in using these external resources than undergoing individual training to improve some personal skill.\r\n\r\nThree sets of general principles arise. The first concerns the \"habits of mind\" that we should adopt to improve the output of our thinking.\r\n\r\n- Offload information from your brain whenever you can. This could mean anything from writing down your thoughts or \"socially offloading\" them to other people.\r\n- Transform information into artefacts, ideally physical ones. Interact with them, tweak them, show them to other people.\r\n- Be proactive in altering your inner state. Take some physical exercise before trying to learn something. Synchronise with others before you attempt group work. Spend time in nature if you have an upcoming creative task.\r\n\r\nThe second set of principles uses our understanding of what the brain evolved to do in order to grasp how mental extension works.\r\n\r\n- Aim to \"re-embody\" information. Allow your body's interoceptive signals to influence your choices. Use physical movement to enact concepts. Focus on your gestures and those of others.\r\n- Re-spatialise information when possible. Our brain processes information via mental maps. Use memory palaces, concept maps and the like to leverage that evolved capacity.\r\n- Re-socialise information. We process it better when we involved others. Teach others what you know, learn from them, imitate, argue, debate and tell each other stories.\r\n\r\nLastly we have a set of principles based on \"what kind of creatures we are\".\r\n\r\n- Deliberately create cognitive loops. Use your body to help you think, then spatialise the information, then run it through the brains of other people. Keep looping it through each realm, again and again.\r\n- Create \"cognitively congenial situations\". Issuing orders to your brain is a strategy often destined to fail. Instead, create environments that draw out the desired result of your thinking. Explain things to your peers, share stories, create a meaningful private space, walk in nature. What you do should depend on your cognitive goal.\r\n- Embed extensions in your day-to-day environment. This can range from arranging \"identity cues\" in your workspace through to deliberately cultivating a transactive memory system with your colleagues.\r\n\r\nI guess the main takeaway is that the best thinking does not generally occur when you are sat still on your own in a bland, neutrally-lit grey office of the sort often designed to aid thinking via being \"distraction-free\". \r\n\r\nBut other people, other environments, other ways of being, your feelings and emotions are not always distractions to good thought. Far from it. Often thoughtfully seeking them out and leveraging them to extend our minds can produce far better thinking outputs, much more suited to the modern world, than the environments we've historically designed.\r\n\r\nThe title of the book seems to be a shout-out to Clark and Chalmers' paper \"[The Extended Mind](https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1)\", which is referred to in the text.

So if you&rsquo;ve come across terminology such as &lsquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension\">type 2 slowly changing dimension</a>&rsquo; or the facts and dimensions used in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_fact_model\">dimensional modelling</a> et al. then it&rsquo;s very possible that your interlocutor has read this tome.</p>\n<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m more an analyst than an engineer, I have dabbled in the latter and this book will be good guidance on how to think things through going forward.</p>\n<p>A key aspect, and one I&rsquo;m grateful for, is to focus on making the data easy to understand and analyse in downstream tools, even if it requires substantially more effort - both technical and diplomatic - up front.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been helpful to me to understand why systems I use are set up like they are - e.g. a distinct absence of using null value where I&rsquo;d initially thought it&rsquo;d make sense to use them. It&rsquo;s also a refresher on basic patterns one can use to enable common analysis requirements like &lsquo;how many times has this value changed over time?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what would the results look like if they were remapped to the historical structure of the organisation?&rsquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s written rather prescriptively - follow this rule or regret it forever! I have been told by practitioners that sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary, or at least preferable, to break the occasional rule in reality but that their recommendations are good ones for the majority of the time.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also organised slightly confusingly in that most of it is divided up into chapters seemingly aimed at various specific business applications e.g. e-commerce or insurance.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling](https://micro.blog/books/9781118530801) by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross.\r\n\r\nMost everyone that's been in charge of designing a large database has recommended this to me as a good summary of how to think about the structure a data warehouse.\r\n\r\nIt teaches [the Kimball method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimball_lifecycle) - you might notice that's one of the authors' surnames. So if you've come across terminology such as '[type 2 slowly changing dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension)' or the facts and dimensions used in [dimensional modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_fact_model) et al. then it's very possible that your interlocutor has read this tome. \r\n\r\nWhilst I'm more an analyst than an engineer, I have dabbled in the latter and this book will be good guidance on how to think things through going forward. \r\n\r\nA key aspect, and one I'm grateful for, is to focus on making the data easy to understand and analyse in downstream tools, even if it requires substantially more effort - both technical and diplomatic - up front.\r\n\r\nIt's been helpful to me to understand why systems I use are set up like they are - e.g. a distinct absence of using null value where I'd initially thought it'd make sense to use them. It's also a refresher on basic patterns one can use to enable common analysis requirements like 'how many times has this value changed over time?' or 'what would the results look like if they were remapped to the historical structure of the organisation?'  \r\n\r\nIt's written rather prescriptively - follow this rule or regret it forever! I have been told by practitioners that sometimes it's necessary, or at least preferable, to break the occasional rule in reality but that their recommendations are good ones for the majority of the time. \r\n\r\nIt's also organised slightly confusingly in that most of it is divided up into chapters seemingly aimed at various specific business applications e.g. e-commerce or insurance. But they're at pains to say that you shouldn't just read the one that's most similar to your organisation or the task you're trying to accomplish as you'll not understand it fully without all the context provided in the earlier chapters that from their title don't seem relevant to you. So I'm not entirely certain why they structured it like that in the first place. \r\n\r\nBut that aside, it's invaluable reading for anyone designing databases or using other people's databases that are designed this way. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/img-5950.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"353\" alt=\"Book cover of The Data Warehouse Toolkit\">\n",

I haven&rsquo;t really missed it all that much. Anyway, yesterday I decided to reactivate it so as to download all the photos I&rsquo;ve ever uploaded to it for safe storage, along with any that I&rsquo;m tagged in that I might like to revisit one day.  The latter isn&rsquo;t a native functionality as far as I&rsquo;m aware but browser extensions <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagged-photo-exporter-for/cicalpgkgmacgnbnnkhdgpnicipnihgo\">like this one</a> purport to enable it.</p>\n<p>This should of course be easy. From <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/214376678584711\">their docs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to come back to Facebook after you&rsquo;ve deactivated your account, you can reactivate your account at any time by logging back in to Facebook or by using your Facebook account to log in somewhere else</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, upon logging in to reactivate the account I was met with this message:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>My account has apparently been permanently disabled for contravening their spam policy. And because it had been over 180 days since they decided to do that - which I had seemingly no way of knowing had happened given my account was temporarily deactivated - there is no way to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>Obviously I haven&rsquo;t been spamming anyone given I deactivated the account but there we go.</p>\n<p>At the very least, given I&rsquo;d explicitly suspended my account so wasn&rsquo;t logging in, I&rsquo;d have expected to have received some kind of robotically generated email to let me know of the supposed spam crime within the 6 months window that would have allowed me to appeal if I cared enough.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it was still possible to export my content; that&rsquo;s the 1 button that&rsquo;s still available even with the block. Although, it comes to you in a single big intricate zip file that may take some time to dig through. But if I had a desire to start using my Facebook account again - something that temporarily deactivating your account is explicitly supposed to allow - then that opportunity is gone.</p>\n<p>As is my social graph of course. The photos are in the zip somewhere, along with a pretty useless list of all the comments I ever made stripped of context - who knows what it was that I loved so much 7 years ago!? But the connections between me and my friends are gone. I&rsquo;m not aware of any social network you could upload that kind of data to even if your friends all agreed to sign up to it. Mainstream social networks are silos.</p>\n<p>Also naturally it only exports the content I uploaded. So photos by me; but not the photos <em>of</em>  me that someone else uploaded, tagged me and shared that I&rsquo;d probably have liked to keep, let alone photos of friends or family, old or new.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t all that terrible from my personal point of view. I&rsquo;ve little interest in using Facebook and I probably have better-quality backups of most of the photos. But some people might fairly be quite annoyed or upset in this situation.</p>\n<p>As always the lesson to take away is that if you ever post anything to a social network you might ever care about, always keep a copy of it safe somewhere you control. And if you value your social graph, well, I&rsquo;m not sure that there is a solution other than being sure to have some other way to contact your nearest and dearest.</p>\n<p>Similarly with your interactions; the to-and-from flow of any meaningful conversations you had or any threads that meant a lot to you. You’ll be able to export your ramblings, but without the context of what you were responding to. We all know how annoying hearing only half a telephone conversation is. Again given the private and proprietary nature of the service, it&rsquo;s hard to know how you can personally mitigate this. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to act like it&rsquo;s 1997 and start printing out everything you found fun on Facebook?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m obviously an outlier because I haven&rsquo;t been using my account for a long time. But other people find themselves unable to access their Facebook accounts for all sorts of reasons in ways that are much more upsetting to them. There are endless discussions online about it, Reddit is a good place to start if you want to find examples.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s this phenomenon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60959811\">making national news</a> last year - I assume it&rsquo;s not an April fool despite the publication date.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;despite not being an avid user, finding her account locked was still upsetting: &ldquo;All of the images from my university years and family occasions are on Facebook</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will no longer have access to 15-plus years of content, which is genuinely sad</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is also quite stressful not knowing what the issue is, and having no recourse to resolve it. To be given no warning and then no way to access our own data is mindboggling.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course no-one has a legal right to have a Facebook account. It&rsquo;s a private company entitled to make its own decisions outside of basic legal requirements. Personally I think a lot of people might be better off without an account. But, believe it or not, Facebook truly is a positive experience for some people. And its sheer size and scope creates a kind of monopolisation such that as much as you&rsquo;re able to &ldquo;export your data&rdquo; - which is certainly a good and important thing - there is often little of use that the average person can do with that data.</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t simply replicate everything you&rsquo;d made the effort to create in Facebook at home or in a competitor&rsquo;s site. Even if you could, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force the people and organisations you want to talk to to move over to someplace new, which is what you&rsquo;d have to do considering Facebook is not a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network\">federated social network</a>.</p>\n<p>Being locked out forever would be especially upsetting for those people for Facebook is where their community is, whether this is how their family prefers  communicate, where the organisations they have to deal with post or where their support groups are. Innumerable organisations - everything from book clubs to government agencies to medical services to advocacy groups and beyond - seem to have chosen Facebook or one of its equally siloed competitors as a primary place to communicate to their members. It&rsquo;s a risky thing to do when you do not have the final say as to who is able to participate.</p>\n",

And because it had been over 180 days since they decided to do that - which I had seemingly no way of knowing had happened given my account was temporarily deactivated - there is no way to appeal the decision. \n\nObviously I haven't been spamming anyone given I deactivated the account but there we go. \n\nAt the very least, given I'd explicitly suspended my account so wasn't logging in, I'd have expected to have received some kind of robotically generated email to let me know of the supposed spam crime within the 6 months window that would have allowed me to appeal if I cared enough.  \n\nThe good news is that it was still possible to export my content; that's the 1 button that's still available even with the block. Although, it comes to you in a single big intricate zip file that may take some time to dig through. But if I had a desire to start using my Facebook account again - something that temporarily deactivating your account is explicitly supposed to allow - then that opportunity is gone. \n\nAs is my social graph of course. The photos are in the zip somewhere, along with a pretty useless list of all the comments I ever made stripped of context - who knows what it was that I loved so much 7 years ago!? But the connections between me and my friends are gone. I'm not aware of any social network you could upload that kind of data to even if your friends all agreed to sign up to it. Mainstream social networks are silos. \n\nAlso naturally it only exports the content I uploaded. So photos by me; but not the photos _of_  me that someone else uploaded, tagged me and shared that I'd probably have liked to keep, let alone photos of friends or family, old or new.\n\nThis isn't all that terrible from my personal point of view. I've little interest in using Facebook and I probably have better-quality backups of most of the photos. But some people might fairly be quite annoyed or upset in this situation. \n\nAs always the lesson to take away is that if you ever post anything to a social network you might ever care about, always keep a copy of it safe somewhere you control. And if you value your social graph, well, I'm not sure that there is a solution other than being sure to have some other way to contact your nearest and dearest. \n\nSimilarly with your interactions; the to-and-from flow of any meaningful conversations you had or any threads that meant a lot to you. You’ll be able to export your ramblings, but without the context of what you were responding to. We all know how annoying hearing only half a telephone conversation is. Again given the private and proprietary nature of the service, it's hard to know how you can personally mitigate this. Perhaps it's time to act like it's 1997 and start printing out everything you found fun on Facebook?\n\nI'm obviously an outlier because I haven't been using my account for a long time. But other people find themselves unable to access their Facebook accounts for all sorts of reasons in ways that are much more upsetting to them. There are endless discussions online about it, Reddit is a good place to start if you want to find examples. \n\nHere's this phenomenon [making national news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60959811) last year - I assume it's not an April fool despite the publication date. \n\n> ...despite not being an avid user, finding her account locked was still upsetting: \"All of the images from my university years and family occasions are on Facebook \n> \n> \"I will no longer have access to 15-plus years of content, which is genuinely sad\n> \n> \"It is also quite stressful not knowing what the issue is, and having no recourse to resolve it. To be given no warning and then no way to access our own data is mindboggling.\"\n\nOf course no-one has a legal right to have a Facebook account. It's a private company entitled to make its own decisions outside of basic legal requirements. Personally I think a lot of people might be better off without an account. But, believe it or not, Facebook truly is a positive experience for some people. And its sheer size and scope creates a kind of monopolisation such that as much as you're able to \"export your data\" - which is certainly a good and important thing - there is often little of use that the average person can do with that data. \n\nYou can't simply replicate everything you'd made the effort to create in Facebook at home or in a competitor's site. Even if you could, you wouldn't be able to force the people and organisations you want to talk to to move over to someplace new, which is what you'd have to do considering Facebook is not a [federated social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network). \n\nBeing locked out forever would be especially upsetting for those people for Facebook is where their community is, whether this is how their family prefers  communicate, where the organisations they have to deal with post or where their support groups are. Innumerable organisations - everything from book clubs to government agencies to medical services to advocacy groups and beyond - seem to have chosen Facebook or one of its equally siloed competitors as a primary place to communicate to their members. It's a risky thing to do when you do not have the final say as to who is able to participate.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781526615718\">We Are Bellingcat</a> by Eliot Higgins.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how Elliot Higgins went from curious internet user, through to an increasingly renowned commentator on blog articles, to starting <a href=\"https://brown-moses.blogspot.com/\">his own blog</a> all the way through to running an increasingly large and influential organisation dedicated to open source intelligence investigations called <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/\">Bellingcat</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence\">Open source intelligence</a>, or OSINT, is &ldquo;the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources&hellip;to produce actionable intelligence&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Bellingcat, named after the fable &ldquo;<a href=\"https://fablesofaesop.com/belling-the-cat.html\">Belling The Cat</a>&rdquo; , has famously used this technique to investigate and produce damning evidence on many geopolitical episodes, including the Malaysian Airlines <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/06/19/identifying-the-separatists-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/\">flight MH17 crash</a>, the poisoning of Putin&rsquo;s enemies <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/\">Alexei Navalny</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/\">Sergei Skripal</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2017/08/29/database-august-12-charlottesville-videos/\">unmasking of neo-Nazis</a> in Charlottesville&rsquo;s rally as well as various unpleasant and illegal incidents occurring in recent <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/09/04/geolocating-libyas-social-media-executioner/\">Libyan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/21/the-open-source-hunt-for-syrias-favourite-sarin-bomb/\">Syrian</a> conflicts . This book contains details of many of their increasingly complex and impactful investigations.</p>\n<p>They also run <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/workshops/\">training courses</a> to let other folk learn their very transferrable, very versatile skills. They&rsquo;re open about how, why and what they did. Transparency is one of the key tenets of their organisation. Knowing that there&rsquo;s no reason for you to trust them beyond any other voice on the internet, they make a big deal of recording and sharing exactly what they did, what their sources were, what they inferred vs validated and all the outstanding questions that they couldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;an online claim is nothing more than a hypothesis, one validated only with backing evidence that others should be able to corroborate themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their motto became &ldquo;Identify, Verify, Amplify&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The most fascinating aspect to me is around the tooling. We all splurge our data every day all over the internet. Most notably on social media of course but many of our daily transactions that we don&rsquo;t explicitly share are in someone&rsquo;s database somewhere - records of your phone usage, travels, identity, financial transactions, property ownership and a whole lot more. Sometimes this kind of data is publicly available legitimately for free or at a reasonable cost. Other times hacked versions are floating about the lesser known parts of the internet.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading [We Are Bellingcat](https://micro.blog/books/9781526615718) by Eliot Higgins.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of how Elliot Higgins went from curious internet user, through to an increasingly renowned commentator on blog articles, to starting [his own blog](https://brown-moses.blogspot.com/) all the way through to running an increasingly large and influential organisation dedicated to open source intelligence investigations called [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/).\r\n\r\n[Open source intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), or OSINT, is \"the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources...to produce actionable intelligence\". \r\n\r\nBellingcat, named after the fable \"[Belling The Cat](https://fablesofaesop.com/belling-the-cat.html)\" , has famously used this technique to investigate and produce damning evidence on many geopolitical episodes, including the Malaysian Airlines [flight MH17 crash](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/06/19/identifying-the-separatists-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/), the poisoning of Putin's enemies [Alexei Navalny](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/) and [Sergei Skripal](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/), the [unmasking of neo-Nazis](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2017/08/29/database-august-12-charlottesville-videos/) in Charlottesville's rally as well as various unpleasant and illegal incidents occurring in recent [Libyan](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/09/04/geolocating-libyas-social-media-executioner/) and [Syrian](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/21/the-open-source-hunt-for-syrias-favourite-sarin-bomb/) conflicts . This book contains details of many of their increasingly complex and impactful investigations. \r\n\r\nThey also run [training courses](https://www.bellingcat.com/workshops/) to let other folk learn their very transferrable, very versatile skills. They're open about how, why and what they did. Transparency is one of the key tenets of their organisation. Knowing that there's no reason for you to trust them beyond any other voice on the internet, they make a big deal of recording and sharing exactly what they did, what their sources were, what they inferred vs validated and all the outstanding questions that they couldn't answer.\r\n\r\n> ...an online claim is nothing more than a hypothesis, one validated only with backing evidence that others should be able to corroborate themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir motto became \"Identify, Verify, Amplify\".\r\n\r\nThe most fascinating aspect to me is around the tooling. We all splurge our data every day all over the internet. Most notably on social media of course but many of our daily transactions that we don't explicitly share are in someone's database somewhere - records of your phone usage, travels, identity, financial transactions, property ownership and a whole lot more. Sometimes this kind of data is publicly available legitimately for free or at a reasonable cost. Other times hacked versions are floating about the lesser known parts of the internet. On occasion the Bellingcat team seem to slightly deviate from the \"open source\" aspect of OSINT and hold their nose and resort to paying off employees of various organisations to share data with them.\r\n\r\nKnowing what sources they've found useful in their work both enables  you to conduct your own investigations as well as be a bit more aware of what you're potentially unknowingly sharing. This is surely a recommended skill for anyone who's been alive in at least the past decade or so.

				"title": "The deleterious effects of bad business models, incentives and AI on music streaming services",
				"content_html": "<p>When Spotify and its competitors launched it heralded a whole new way to listen to music. Suddenly everyone who could afford a relatively cheap monthly subscription and a device to use it on had access to a near infinite list of the world&rsquo;s most loved music. Recommendation algorithms would expose them to new music they&rsquo;re very likely to love. At the same time, it&rsquo;d cut down on the pull that led some people to pirate their music, so that artists would get paid more fully. Smaller artists who didn&rsquo;t have the means to promote or produce huge worldwide release could get an audience beyond their local pub. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>\n<p>Inevitably, plenty. Naturally it&rsquo;s not only <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html\">extremely bad AI-written books</a> that are attempting to flood our media channels, and occasionally charts, with dross. Music provides another example, for many of the same reasons.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s the AI side of things - both the generative AIs that can &ldquo;create&rdquo; music. But also the more traditional, less hyped, AIs that are used to engage the user with the  apps concerned. And I suppose the AIs that listen to the music, more on that later.</p>\n<p>But there&rsquo;s more to be concerned about, including bad business models, bad incentives, and the exploitation that inevitably shows up once a few giant middle-men effectively monopolise the relationship between people that produce things of value and those that wish to consume them to the extent that they&rsquo;re incentives are entirely distinct from either party.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m an increasing fan of Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message\">the medium is the message</a>&rdquo;. Sure, songs are still songs, but &ldquo;song&rdquo; is vague enough that there&rsquo;s plenty of room for the medium of distribution to influence its content. Perhaps the delivery method is also the message to some extent. His colleague, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message\">John Culkin, opined</a> that &ldquo;we shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us&rdquo;. Our music-creating, music-promoting and music-listening tools have certainly changed in recent times.</p>\n<h2 id=\"torrents-of-new-music-flood-the-system-each-day\">Torrents of new &ldquo;music&rdquo; flood the system each day</h2>\n<p>Apparently there are 120,000 <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/there-are-now-120000-new-tracks-hitting-music-streaming-services-each-day/\">new music tracks being uploaded to music streaming services such as Spotify each day</a>. Each <em>day</em>. MBW calculates that at that rate this year we&rsquo;ll have added 43 million new tracks to the archives - substantially more than even the estimated 34 million tracks uploaded last year.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>(An ISRC is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code\">International Standard Recording Code</a>, used to uniquely identify sounds and music recordings.)</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, not all of these are new Taylor Swift songs, Beatle re-releases or even exciting new work from up-and-coming new indie bands. Some of it is literally noise; white noise, fan noise, rain noise, other noises are available. More of it is a near infinite of variety of customised &ldquo;Happy Birthday to X&rdquo; songs with X replaced by the names of most people you might imagine sending well-wishes to.</p>\n<p>And an increasing amount of it is AI generated. And not even 2023-level-AI generated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Universal Music Group’s Q1 earnings call, Sir Lucian Grainge criticized what he calls the “content oversupply” that currently sees around 100,000+ tracks distributed to music streaming services each day.</p>\n<p>“Not many people realize that AI has already been a major contributor to this content oversupply,” said Grainge.</p>\n<p>“Most of this AI content on DSPs comes from the prior generation of AI, a technology that is not trained on copyrighted IP and that produces very poor quality output with virtually no consumer appeal.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-incentive-structure-encourages-people-to-game-the-system\">The incentive structure encourages people to game the system</h2>\n<p>But, similar to the way <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html\">Kindle Unlimited pays its authors</a>, it&rsquo;s not really the quality of the track that matters. It&rsquo;s whether it was played a lot or not. It&rsquo;s the word that we&rsquo;ve perhaps all learned to dread a little: &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;. 1000 people playing a minute of white noise often produces the same revenue for the creator as 100 people listening to a 10-track album of Taylor&rsquo;s finest.</p>\n<p>As the CEO of Warner Music puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I note he doesn&rsquo;t specify whether an Ed Sheeran stream is worth more <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/music/why-does-everyone-hate-ed-sheeran/\">or less</a> than a recording of the rain, but either way you can probably think of some track of music you personally feel confident has a great deal more value to you and perhaps even to the world at large than listening to one of a million varieties of rain, a good proportion of which might actually 2010-era auto-generated AI fake rain noise.</p>\n<p>So where do we end up? With the same dynamics as we had for <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html\">those terrible AI-written Kindle books</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;.the inevitable coming together of the generative AI infocalypse, enshittified subscription service monopolies, misguided algorithmic recommendation systems and the incentives of modern-day capitalism</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This of course leads &ldquo;creators&rdquo; to game the system. Which is why every time I try to listen to something popular like <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/26/listening-to-endless.html\">&ldquo;Flowers&rdquo;</a> I have to be quick on the pause button if I don&rsquo;t want to end up listening to an algorithmically generated rotation of various knockoff variations of the original. Or, to be honest, one reason why for the most part I relieve the pre-Spotify era and almost always listen to music in units of albums, rather songs or playlists. As a sidenote, if this too is your preference and you&rsquo;re an Apple Music user then I heartily recommend the iOS <a href=\"https://www.albumstheapp.com/\">Albums app</a> which near-forces you into that mode of operation.</p>\n<p>Not all of the system gaming is AI adjacent of course. Humans are more than capable of coming up with their own quantity-increasing quality-reducing schemes. Six years ago, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/streaming-music-cheat-codes.html\">Vulture wrote up</a> some of those shenanigans for us to peruse.</p>\n<p>There are the aforementioned people trying to trick you into listening to their knockoff version of whatever the current genuine-hit song is. It might be a cover, or it might be something totally different but with a similar sounding name.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;the coverbots and ripoff artists who vomit out inferior versions of popular songs every week, flooding the website with dreck that only succeeds when users are misled. No one would willingly listen to King Stitch’s “Sit Down, Be Humble,” a third-rate cover of Lamar’s original, but the track has been streamed more than 300,000 times thanks to Spotify’s broad search results and a clever title designed to confuse those who don’t know the song’s real name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s entries that are not a malicious deception. They&rsquo;re just not really the same category of thing as the classic idea of an album, even though they are displayed indistinguishably.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some artists, a term used very loosely here, are providing people exactly what they want. It just so happens that what they want is ephemeral nonsense. Take, for example, the artist Happy Birthday Library, whose Spotify catalogue consists of hundreds of personalized versions of “Happy Birthday” streamed more than a million times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The algorithms and incentives naturally have an effect on the actually talented and occasionally mega-famous folks too, reshaping what they produce and share. Vulture, <a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/\">and others</a>, suggests that the reason Chris Brown released a 40 track album is because that&rsquo;s the way to boost your streaming numbers the most. Remember, you get paid per stream of each track - not each album. This huge-track count trick can naturally be used by lesser-known folk too</p>\n<p>As they conclude, albeit perhaps with rather rose-tinted spectacles on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never before has a song title or artist name been more important than the actual songs themselves.\n&hellip;\nNever before have so many songs existed just so an album can have a 20th, 30th, or 40th track</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Overall they list 11 ways they&rsquo;ve noticed artists adapting to Spotify&rsquo;s incentives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Happy Birthday gimmick mentioned above. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to listen to a song entitled &ldquo;Happy Birthday whatever-your-name-is&rdquo;?</li>\n<li>Writing songs about everything someone might conceivably search for; their example being &ldquo;the song “Have You Been to Radnor Township?” on the 93-track album Pennsylvania Songs: PA Exiting&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Releasing multiple albums with the same songs, often titled differently.</li>\n<li>Release an absolutely silent &ldquo;song&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Convincing people to get their computers to fake-listen to the song.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Filling the void&rdquo; - releasing covers of songs from famous artists who aren&rsquo;t on Spotify.</li>\n<li>Trying to trick people by naming their songs very similarly to more famous ones. Someone searching for Imagine Dragon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; might not realise they accidentally clicked on the 1-hit wonder Imagine Demon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Covering everything famous, all the time.</li>\n<li>Adding unnessecary extra tracks to albums as noted above.</li>\n<li>Putting your past popular singles in your new album.</li>\n<li>Seeding popular Spotify playlists with fake artists - something Spotify has been accused of doing, more on this below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OK, so is it all greedy users exploiting the opportunities the likes of Spotify inadvertently make available to them? No, it is not. It&rsquo;s easy to go too far in absolving the platforms for their responsibility for this.</p>\n<p>For one, it&rsquo;s 2023. We know how these things go. Everything product decision is a choice. The big platforms decide where to prioritise their development. They decide what they accept and how. If some of the above isn&rsquo;t what the platforms want to promote then surely if users can find it easily enough to repeatedly write articles about the issue then so could they, given their access to reams of confidential internal data.</p>\n<p>In fact they do, sometimes.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year Spotify <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/spotify-ai-music-generator-purges-bots-listening-songs-1850419032\">removed thousands of AI generated songs</a> from its catalogue. Many were those autogenerated by <a href=\"https://boomy.com/\">Boomy</a> - a site that sells itself as enabling you to &ldquo;Create original songs in seconds, even if you&rsquo;ve never made music before&rdquo; and &quot; Submit your songs to streaming platforms and get paid when people listen&quot;.</p>\n<p>Now as with many generative AI tools, it may not be a bad thing in principle. It might enable people who otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to create their own music be able to, in the same way as the image generators could allow expressions of novel creativity otherwise unavailable to most. But it&rsquo;s also catnip for folk that care more for income than art.</p>\n<h2 id=\"robots-are-creating-music-for-robots-to-listen-to\">Robots are creating music for robots to listen to</h2>\n<p>So why did Spotify go on a deleting rampage of these tracks? Not particularly because they weren&rsquo;t a great experience for the average user. And there&rsquo;s certainly no prohibition on using AI to write or help write one&rsquo;s music.</p>\n<p>Rather it was because the people <em>listening</em> to that music were fake. Remember that Spotify pays out based on how many people listen to your tracks. So &ldquo;creators&rdquo; built bots that  &ldquo;listened&rdquo; to the tracks again and again. It&rsquo;s essentially fraud, given the terms of service.</p>\n<p>So in a somewhat dystopian-feeling loop, people are using AI to create music that is mostly listened to by other AIs, no humans involved.</p>\n<p>The business model and recommendation algorithms of the mainstream music streaming platforms - quantity over quality, quantity over everything - makes them as vulnerable to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm\">clickfarms</a> as any other type of site that provides some kind of reward for attracting lots of traffic of any kind. In this case Spotify has to pay for it directly, which is finally enough of a reason for them to act on it.</p>\n<p>People are trying to measure these fake listeners. A French government organisation reported <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/fake-music-streams-france-1-billion-2021-report/\">that 1-3% of all French streams</a> in 2021 were fraudulent based on data from Spotify, Deezer and Qobuz. This is likely an underestimate due to the use of VPNs and the like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beatdapp.com/\">Beatdapp</a>, a company who sells a tool that looks for streaming fraud so is admittedly incentivised to claim that there&rsquo;s a lot of it, wrote that at least 10% of all streaming activity in 2022 was fraudulent. That&rsquo;s equivalent to $2 billion of revenue illegitimately extracted. They believe that it&rsquo;ll be worth $7.5 billion by 2030 if it is not stopped.</p>\n<p>The fact that more streams = more money has also been more publicly exploited in the past. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/\">Eternify was a service that lets users input the name of their favourite artists</a> and it&rsquo;d play their songs on repeat for exactly 30 seconds each on Spotify. 30 seconds was the threshold at which the artist gets paid, so this was a way you could optimise the income of your preferred musicians without the obstacle of having to actually listen to their output. The site would slowly count up the revenue your mouse-click had accrued for them.</p>\n<p>It seems to be have been more of a protest statement from some understandably disenchanted musicians than something that aimed to enable fraudsters. And it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have saved many starving artists without a truly mass takeup. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/\">Forbes calculated</a> that using it for a solid day would generate perhaps $1.44 for the artist in question. In any case, it cost Spotify directly enough to make them go to the effort of <a href=\"https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/06/26/spotify-shuts-down-royalty-boosting-scheme-eternify/\">shutting it down</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-pay-most-musicians-receive-from-the-service-is-incredibly-low\">The &ldquo;pay&rdquo; most musicians receive from the service is incredibly low</h2>\n<p>The $1.44 a day figure reveals another not-so-hidden truth. These services are really not paying out a lot of money to the creators of what they&rsquo;re selling access to. So much so that even a committee of British MPs - a group <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html\">not particularly known</a> for its sympathy or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/30/the-guardian-view-on-cuts-to-arts-funding-a-calamity-that-must-be-averted\">care for artists</a> - are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473\">worried about it</a>.</p>\n<p>From all that revenue you&rsquo;re providing to the streaming services, the folk involved in producing the music are receiving about 16% of it.</p>\n<p>Spotify is thought to be paying out between £0.002 and £0.0038 every time you play a stream. Apple Music pays a bit more, a whopping £0.0059. Youtube a bit less, about £0.00052.</p>\n<p>And &ldquo;pays out&rdquo; is doing a lot of work there, as even many of the reports about &ldquo;Spotify only pays artists £x&rdquo; seem to miss. That 0.2 pence has got to be divided up between anyone with interests or rights to the music, as well as each member of the band, the composer, the writers, and so on.</p>\n<p>The BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473\">provides an infographic</a> to help us visualise what that means.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the recording industry was particularly renowned for being favourable to artists even before the streaming revolution. Anyway, all in all, the recording artist(s) often might expect to receive about 13% of that 0.2p. Under a third of a penny.</p>\n<p>Thirds of pennies don&rsquo;t add up fast. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musician&rsquo;s Union suggested that over 80% of musicians made less than £200 a year from streaming during 2019. 93% didn&rsquo;t break the £1000 milestone.</p>\n<p>Sure, the megastars might earn substantially more than enough to survive on, but even their entourage aren&rsquo;t necessarily doing well. The writer of one of the songs on Kylie Minogue&rsquo;s number-one charting album &ldquo;Disco&rdquo; reported receiving £100.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,&rdquo; she told MPs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite shameful.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"spotify-seems-to-be-gaming-its-own-platform\">Spotify seems to be gaming its own platform</h2>\n<p>Back to the fake streams. As wrong as it is, let&rsquo;s not feel <em>too</em> sorry for some of the platforms subject to this streaming fraud. Spotify&rsquo;s seeming attempts to game it&rsquo;s own system at the expense of other artists and their own users have been written about elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s the time it was found to be <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/spotify-said-to-retaliate-against-artists-with-apple-exclusives?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">burying songs</a> from musicians because they&rsquo;d also made deals with their rivals. Maybe that&rsquo;s understandable, maybe not, but I&rsquo;d guess most users don&rsquo;t understand that to be what&rsquo;s going on when they search for a song.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s even less obvious is that sometimes Spotify decides to pay producers a flat fee to create tracks such that Spotify owns the copyright. They then upload them to their own serivce under fake artist names, people that don&rsquo;t exist. Why?</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-creating-its-own-recordings-and-putting-them-on-playlists/\">Music Business Worldwide</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why would Spotify be instructing producers to write and record tracks of this nature?</p>\n<p>Bingo: to appear on some of its relaxing first-party playlists, which boast millions of followers between them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now they don&rsquo;t seem to get anything like as many plays as the most popular songs on the platform so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s necessarily dominating the user experience. But each time users plays a track from one of these fake artists Spotify only has to pay itself the stream royalties. Over 50 fake artists of this kind <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-spotifys-fake-artists-problem-is-an-epidemic-literally/\">have been found</a> now, almost all of which have had millions of streams.</p>\n<p>As ever, it&rsquo;s not entirely a black and white issue. Spotify have explicitly denied some (but perhaps not all) of these allegations. And, in this case, behind the fake artists are real people playing real music. They&rsquo;re just paid in a way much more favourable to Spotify at scale than other artists, and they seem to have an automatic route to being included in much-coveted very popular playlists.</p>\n<p>Spotify curated playlists apparently account for <a href=\"https://bandzoogle.com/blog/how-to-get-your-music-featured-on-spotify-playlists\">around a third</a> what&rsquo;s listened to on the platform in terms of time. To get onto one of them, most musicians have to actively <a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/\">pitch their music</a> for inclusion, one song at a time, before the song has been released. Most of the pitches, <a href=\"https://artists.spotify.com/blog/behind-the-playlists-your-questions-answered-by-our-playlist-editors\">around 80%</a>, are turned down without explanation.</p>\n<p>Arguably, similar dynamics exist in other types of streaming services. Netflix does of course make its own shows which it heavily promotes on its own service. But as a user it does feel disingenuous to me at least. Why not label these tracks as having been produced by Spotify? Why not explain how they got onto the playlists?</p>\n<p>Based on some patent applications, some folk <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/spotify-could-soon-replace-real-artists-with-ai-music\">seem to think</a> that eventually Spotify might take the human out of the creation process altogether, potentially filling its playlists with music they generated themselves via AI. Presumably competing against those independent users uploading their own AI music, albeit with potentially a thumb on the scale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enshittification-yet-again\">Enshittification, yet again</h2>\n<p>Platforms such as Spotify appear to potentially provide great examples of Doctorow&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html\">theory of enshittification</a>. When they first launched they appeared provided incredible value for users, revolutionary in some ways. You could access literally millions of much-sought after music for a relatively low monthly cost - or even free on Spotify at least if you were happy to tolerate adverts - entirely on demand. A radio station perfectly attuned to your minute-by-minute preferences. A way to experience far more of the musical art than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html\">you could ever afford</a> to if you were paying £12.99+ for an individual album like ye olde days. An experience much safer and easier, not to mention less criminal and more conducive to rewarding musicians than yesteryear&rsquo;s internet underground <a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/\">piracy scene</a>.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lofty-optimism-of-spotify-and-the-influence-of-the-streaming-revolution\">The New Yorker wrote</a> about Spotify 5 years ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The company is essentially insisting that freer and easier access to music is the only thing that matters; everything should be available to everyone, because freedom of choice is an essential freedom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The platforms attracted so many listeners with this fabulous promise that they became attractive, perhaps essential, to artists. Even many of the very rich very famous names who have sworn off Spotify at some point in time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat\">came</a> <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/thom-yorke-solo-albums-back-on-spotify.html\">back</a>, presumably for the audience and its impact on the charts. If you weren&rsquo;t popular on Spotify then you&rsquo;d not so much hope of ever topping the bill, attracting the most revenue, being the most famous.</p>\n<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;d even enable vast numbers of people to realise their artistic dreams in a way they&rsquo;d otherwise never have been able to. As <a href=\"https://pennyfractions.ghost.io/spotify-s-revolutionary-plan-to-support-one-million-artists/\">they wrote 4 years ago</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“the goal of our marketplace strategy is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But now, in the final stage, the platforms claw back more and more of the value for themselves.</p>\n<p>They stop gaining marketshare only by virtue of being <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/02/will-spotify-ever-turn-a-profit/\">able to sustain periods of loss</a>.  They <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630821/spotify-design-home-music-podcasts-audiobooks-app\">change the user interface</a> longer than their competitors. What&rsquo;s promoted, when and how becomes something less aligned with the reasons that many users may have originally signed up. They try to make it inconvenient for either <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/how-to-quit-spotify-and-what-you-give-up-if-you-do.html\">users</a> or <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/03/why-artists-leaving-spotify/\">creators</a> to leave, and costly for artists to make deals with competitors.  They acquire potential future competitors or expand into adjacent-ish markets to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/spotify-needs-to-profit-from-a-music-revolution/2023/01/18/e71c548c-96ef-11ed-a173-61e055ec24ef_story.html\">increase the perceived lock-in</a>. They <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021\">raise prices</a> - although some believe that the recent near-universal streaming price rises in conjunction with a cost-of-living crisis is resulting in <a href=\"https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2023/10/30/online-piracy-streaming\">an increase in piracy</a>. They alter recommendation algorithms, alter incentives.</p>\n<p>All very logical from the point of view of shareholder value et al, at least in the short term. It&rsquo;s not necessarily driven by maliciousness; I&rsquo;m sure many of Spotify&rsquo;s employees love music, love musicians, embrace that vision of enabling a million artists to live off their work. It&rsquo;s just that at the end of the day the company&rsquo;s own incentive is all about coming up with the financial arrangements that most benefit themselves in the marketplace, whether or not it&rsquo;s at the expense of either or both sides of the user-creator relationship that&rsquo;s the fundamental reason that they can exist in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-tools-shape-us\">The tools shape us</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s more amorphous to define and subjective to evaluate, but perhaps these services have significantly changed how we tend to consume music beyond the technical side of things. McLuhan and Culkin&rsquo;s quotes apply on the demand side too. The medium is the message. We shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us.</p>\n<p>In days of yore, listeners would usually have to invest financially in a specific number of physical instantiations of music; a cassette tape, a CD or an LP album amongst other formats. In the iPod era this moved onto digital downloads, but still at the level of purchasing individual songs rather than access to a smorgasbord of (a somewhat misleading perception of) everything everywhere, all at once, all the time.</p>\n<p>For most people this put a limit on how much music they had access to. This seems prima facie bad at first glance, and perhaps it is. But maybe it also encouraged folk to spend more time and intention in choosing what they listened to, more time exploring any one individual work.  I expect a fair proportion of people don&rsquo;t even know what they recently listened to when they&rsquo;ve opened their app at the start of the day and hit the &ldquo;especially for you&rdquo; playlist.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music\">the Guardian talked to a bunch of people</a> who&rsquo;d moved from streaming music back to more traditional forms of consumption they found some examples of this. Here&rsquo;s Lethem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[With streaming] there’s endless accessibility, but you’re not really listening to anything. At least that’s what it started feeling like to me. I’m experiencing so much music, but am I really listening to any of it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like what the algo chose then you can just hit skip 5 seconds in and be provided with something else that tries to hook you in. And it&rsquo;ll continue forever. There&rsquo;s no real concept of sitting down to appreciate an album end-to-end when the album is a literally endless playlist.</p>\n<p>Many of these services do let you listen by album of course, at least if you pay them for that ability. I&rsquo;d be curious to know how many people still do that. It&rsquo;s certainly not the style of listening I feel like I see most heavily encouraged by the apps. Similar to the Youtube and Netflix style next-episode auto-play, the last thing they want to do is make you think you &ldquo;finished&rdquo; something to the extent you close the app.</p>\n<p>Fairly incredibly, Spotify even used to default to shuffling the tracks of the album you selected into a random order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/21/spotify-hides-shuffle-button-adele-albums-should-tell-a-story\">before Adele requested they stopped doing that</a> because, of course, there is usually a reason why the tracks were put in that order in the first place. To quote her:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some more conceptual albums would surely simply make very little sense out of order.</p>\n<p>So hey, it&rsquo;s not like Spotify <em>never</em> listens to feedback, at least from megastars. Although even now you do have to be a paying customer of Spotify in order to be given the privilege of a &ldquo;play in the proper order&rdquo; button.</p>\n<p>More recently Amazon actually <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-music-alexa-restrictions-shuffle-11674054533\">went in the opposite direction</a> for its basic music streaming service. Subscribers to Amazon Prime, a service that costs around £9 a month and offers a variety of benefits to Amazon customers including music streaming, found that instead of the previous behaviour of being to choose what they listen to, when they requested music by a particular artist they would get a single track from that artist followed by a load of tracks from other people. Even their manually customised playlists started to shuffle around.</p>\n<p>An unhappy customer reports his confusion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. McKenna, who lives near Albany, N.Y., spent years curating Amazon Music playlists&hellip;.Recently, the app began playing a rock song he had never heard. When he got to the office, he tried to click on a Kenny Chesney song in his playlist, but it didn’t work. Songs he didn’t recognize kept playing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Bob, his chronologically-defined playlists not any more being chronological was enough to drive him back to CDs and Windows Media Player - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve gone back to 2005&rdquo;. The only way to keep hold of your Amazon Music collection and listen to what you want to when you want to now became to upgrade to the more expensive &ldquo;Amazon Unlimited&rdquo; service.</p>\n<p>Shifts in people&rsquo;s listening choices are certainly not all about these services removing features that were once there. Even where you can in theory still choose to listen to exactly what you want, here&rsquo;s Nick from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music\">previously-mentioned Guardian article</a> confirming a shift in his behaviour he experienced soon after switching to streaming that I suspect is quite common:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found myself selecting more and more just one-off songs from an artist, whereas before I’d been inclined to save a whole album</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The obvious &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; alternative 20 years ago was to listen to the radio or a TV channel like MTV where for the most part you are subjected to other people&rsquo;s musical selections. From beginning to end, with no skip button. This might let you discover something so new and wonderful that you - and your 2023 recommendation algorithm - would never have considered if left to your own devices. On the other hand you had to listen to a lot of dross you didn&rsquo;t like, and would perhaps never happen to be listening at the right time to hear songs you were more likely to enjoy  - so again, nothing here is all good or all bad. But it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.</p>\n<p>Finlay, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music\">the same Guardian article</a>, spoke to the issue above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With streaming, he says: “If I didn’t gel with an album or an artist’s work at first, I tended not to go back to it.” But he realised that a lot of his all-time favourite albums were ones that grew on him over time. “Streaming was actually contributing to some degree of dismissal of new music.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jared speaks to both upsides and downsides:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My musical experiences definitely feel more dedicated and focused. It’s not as convenient. I’ll reluctantly admit that I listen to less music. Although on Spotify, I wasn’t necessarily listening to stuff. I was checking out the first 15 seconds and hitting skip. Now, I have to work for it and I like that. I can use the internet as a search tool but I’m not using it as a means to listen. I really have to seek things out and research.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Virginia likewise, exhibiting a pattern I found myself adhering to at first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will listen to one song 100 times in a row, but I won’t give the rest of the album a chance. Before I used streaming services, I would listen to the whole thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even conceptually, the word &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; has connotations that may affect how we feel about what we&rsquo;re listening to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before there was streaming music, what else was streaming? This idea that you can just turn on a faucet, and out comes music. It’s something that leaves everyone to take it for granted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, many of these ex-streamer folk talked about the extra work they now had to do to find what they like. It can comes at a financial cost too, which risks making some of what I wrote seem elitist and gatekeepery as well as Ludditey. After all why should only people with time and wealth to spare have access to reasonable quantities of music? What&rsquo;s wrong with having convenient and cheap access to so much art? Nothing on the face of it, if we can find a business model that doesn&rsquo;t incentivise its enshittification and abuse of the creators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"streaming-isnt-necessarily-cheap-and-you-end-up-owning-nothing\">Streaming isn&rsquo;t necessarily cheap, and you end up owning nothing</h2>\n<p>Although I would note that for the moderately well-off that it&rsquo;s not clear to me that paying for a year of Spotify is necessarily cheaper than buying a few albums that mean something to you. Right now, Spotify paid edition would cost you £131.88 a year. That would also buy you a good amount of singles, albums, whatever you&rsquo;re into. That might well suit people who prefer to or simply happen to end up listening to a certain subset of everything repeatedly. And it&rsquo;s almost certainly better for the artists concerned.</p>\n<p>It also means your music becomes &ldquo;yours&rdquo;. You can keep a CD or, let&rsquo;s be realistic given it&rsquo;s 2023, an MP3 or lossless music file whether or not you want to keep subscribing to any given service. I&rsquo;ve been an Apple Music subscriber in my time, and I liked the service. But assuming one day you will choose to, or be forced to, stop paying the company the monthly fee then it&rsquo;s all gone. If I want to switch to a different service then it&rsquo;s a faff. Copying your favourite playlists, likes, subscribes, downloads et al  to a new place isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy - the new service may even be missing some of your tracks. And moving your carefully refined recommendation algorithms across services isn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s radar at all and probably won&rsquo;t ever be; it&rsquo;s each company&rsquo;s secret sauce.</p>\n<p>You also certainly can&rsquo;t give your collection or pieces of it to anyone. You can&rsquo;t give what you don&rsquo;t own. I can&rsquo;t find it now, but I remember reading a story about the joy and meaning someone got from inheriting the music collection of their sadly recently-deceased father; the feelings and memories that listening to what he&rsquo;d collected over a lifetime evoked. But that&rsquo;s something that likely becomes unavailable with a shift to streaming.</p>\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any documentation about what happens to someone&rsquo;s music streaming account when they die, outside of <a href=\"https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;filter=location&amp;location=forum-board:spotifyaccountrelated&amp;q=deceased\">several posts on the Spotify forums</a> that mainly end in &ldquo;try asking customer services&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s surely not something that someone inherits&gt; If you don&rsquo;t know the person&rsquo;s password and can open to their email then access may be gone for good. If it&rsquo;s a pay-for service then I imagine every trace of it simply vanishes as soon as the credit card fails to bill.</p>\n<p>Talking about dying is admittedly a little dramatic. But there are other ways your favoured streaming services might be denied to you even whilst alive. Services close, even ones from <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/google-play-music-will-shutdown-completely-in-december-heres-how-to-save-your-music\">hugely successful companies</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Say goodbye to Google Play Music, the service will be going away for good in December 2020 and with it, all your music if you don&rsquo;t transfer it over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are you old enough to remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio\">Rdio</a>? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Music\">Beats Music</a>? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Music_Unlimited\">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a>? Or any of the other 20-30 services currently listed on Wikipedia in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services#Discontinued_services\">its &ldquo;Discontinued services&rdquo; section</a>, either entirely shut down or purchased by and replaced with the current handful of big players.</p>\n<p>Or you may simply lose access to your account. If Apple, Amazon, Spotify, or whoever you&rsquo;re with decide for some reason that they don&rsquo;t want you to have an account then it&rsquo;s all gone. The various chatboards of the internet are full of stories of people losing their accounts from the big tech firms. Oftentimes they&rsquo;re more concerned about their emails or photos than their music. But it&rsquo;s all the same. If Apple, Spotify or the rest of them decide you&rsquo;ve been misbehaving, or can&rsquo;t be convinced that you are who you say you are, then whatever effort you&rsquo;ve put into maintaining your collection is lost. I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s probably rarer for this to happen with music streaming services than some categories - it&rsquo;s harder to imagine being accused of &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; a music streaming account but as many Reddit posts show, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>\n<p>For the paid-only services, which is most of them, of course the same happens if your circumstances change such that you can no longer afford the service. And even if not, you&rsquo;re bound to implicitly supporting any changes in the streaming company&rsquo;s rules, strategies, personnel or ethics if you want to keep the music flowing. This might well be a price worth paying for many people, for most people. But it is a price.</p>\n<p>If one of these eventualities does happen to you, then there are third-party services that try attempt to transfer your streaming collections and various metadata between one such service and another, although I haven&rsquo;t tried any of them out enough to know how well they work. But not if you already lost access to the service you want to move from. And of course they won&rsquo;t be able to transfer your playlists, likes et al to a service that doesn&rsquo;t have the particular track involved.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "When Spotify and its competitors launched it heralded a whole new way to listen to music. Suddenly everyone who could afford a relatively cheap monthly subscription and a device to use it on had access to a near infinite list of the world's most loved music. Recommendation algorithms would expose them to new music they're very likely to love. At the same time, it'd cut down on the pull that led some people to pirate their music, so that artists would get paid more fully. Smaller artists who didn't have the means to promote or produce huge worldwide release could get an audience beyond their local pub. What's not to love?\r\n\r\nInevitably, plenty. Naturally it's not only [extremely bad AI-written books](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html) that are attempting to flood our media channels, and occasionally charts, with dross. Music provides another example, for many of the same reasons.\r\n\r\nThere's the AI side of things - both the generative AIs that can \"create\" music. But also the more traditional, less hyped, AIs that are used to engage the user with the  apps concerned. And I suppose the AIs that listen to the music, more on that later.\r\n\r\nBut there's more to be concerned about, including bad business models, bad incentives, and the exploitation that inevitably shows up once a few giant middle-men effectively monopolise the relationship between people that produce things of value and those that wish to consume them to the extent that they're incentives are entirely distinct from either party.\r\n\r\nI'm an increasing fan of Marshall McLuhan's idea that \"[the medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message)\". Sure, songs are still songs, but \"song\" is vague enough that there's plenty of room for the medium of distribution to influence its content. Perhaps the delivery method is also the message to some extent. His colleague, [John Culkin, opined](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message) that \"we shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us\". Our music-creating, music-promoting and music-listening tools have certainly changed in recent times.\r\n\r\n## Torrents of new \"music\" flood the system each day\r\n\r\nApparently there are 120,000 [new music tracks being uploaded to music streaming services such as Spotify each day](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/there-are-now-120000-new-tracks-hitting-music-streaming-services-each-day/). Each *day*. MBW calculates that at that rate this year we'll have added 43 million new tracks to the archives - substantially more than even the estimated 34 million tracks uploaded last year.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/isrc.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n(An ISRC is an [International Standard Recording Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code), used to uniquely identify sounds and music recordings.)\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, not all of these are new Taylor Swift songs, Beatle re-releases or even exciting new work from up-and-coming new indie bands. Some of it is literally noise; white noise, fan noise, rain noise, other noises are available. More of it is a near infinite of variety of customised \"Happy Birthday to X\" songs with X replaced by the names of most people you might imagine sending well-wishes to. \r\n\r\nAnd an increasing amount of it is AI generated. And not even 2023-level-AI generated:\r\n\r\n>On Universal Music Group’s Q1 earnings call, Sir Lucian Grainge criticized what he calls the “content oversupply” that currently sees around 100,000+ tracks distributed to music streaming services each day.\r\n>\r\n>“Not many people realize that AI has already been a major contributor to this content oversupply,” said Grainge.\r\n>\r\n>“Most of this AI content on DSPs comes from the prior generation of AI, a technology that is not trained on copyrighted IP and that produces very poor quality output with virtually no consumer appeal.”\r\n\r\n## The incentive structure encourages people to game the system\r\n\r\nBut, similar to the way [Kindle Unlimited pays its authors](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html), it's not really the quality of the track that matters. It's whether it was played a lot or not. It's the word that we've perhaps all learned to dread a little: \"engagement\". 1000 people playing a minute of white noise often produces the same revenue for the creator as 100 people listening to a 10-track album of Taylor's finest. \r\n\r\nAs the CEO of Warner Music puts it:\r\n\r\n> It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof.\r\n\r\nI note he doesn't specify whether an Ed Sheeran stream is worth more [or less](https://wegotthiscovered.com/music/why-does-everyone-hate-ed-sheeran/) than a recording of the rain, but either way you can probably think of some track of music you personally feel confident has a great deal more value to you and perhaps even to the world at large than listening to one of a million varieties of rain, a good proportion of which might actually 2010-era auto-generated AI fake rain noise.\r\n\r\nSo where do we end up? With the same dynamics as we had for [those terrible AI-written Kindle books](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html).\r\n\r\n>....the inevitable coming together of the generative AI infocalypse, enshittified subscription service monopolies, misguided algorithmic recommendation systems and the incentives of modern-day capitalism\r\n\r\nThis of course leads \"creators\" to game the system. Which is why every time I try to listen to something popular like [\"Flowers\"](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/26/listening-to-endless.html) I have to be quick on the pause button if I don't want to end up listening to an algorithmically generated rotation of various knockoff variations of the original. Or, to be honest, one reason why for the most part I relieve the pre-Spotify era and almost always listen to music in units of albums, rather songs or playlists. As a sidenote, if this too is your preference and you're an Apple Music user then I heartily recommend the iOS [Albums app](https://www.albumstheapp.com/) which near-forces you into that mode of operation.\r\n\r\nNot all of the system gaming is AI adjacent of course. Humans are more than capable of coming up with their own quantity-increasing quality-reducing schemes. Six years ago, [Vulture wrote up](https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/streaming-music-cheat-codes.html) some of those shenanigans for us to peruse.\r\n\r\nThere are the aforementioned people trying to trick you into listening to their knockoff version of whatever the current genuine-hit song is. It might be a cover, or it might be something totally different but with a similar sounding name.\r\n\r\n>...the coverbots and ripoff artists who vomit out inferior versions of popular songs every week, flooding the website with dreck that only succeeds when users are misled. No one would willingly listen to King Stitch’s “Sit Down, Be Humble,” a third-rate cover of Lamar’s original, but the track has been streamed more than 300,000 times thanks to Spotify’s broad search results and a clever title designed to confuse those who don’t know the song’s real name.\r\n\r\nThen there's entries that are not a malicious deception. They're just not really the same category of thing as the classic idea of an album, even though they are displayed indistinguishably. \r\n\r\n>Some artists, a term used very loosely here, are providing people exactly what they want. It just so happens that what they want is ephemeral nonsense. Take, for example, the artist Happy Birthday Library, whose Spotify catalogue consists of hundreds of personalized versions of “Happy Birthday” streamed more than a million times.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms and incentives naturally have an effect on the actually talented and occasionally mega-famous folks too, reshaping what they produce and share. Vulture, [and others](https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/), suggests that the reason Chris Brown released a 40 track album is because that's the way to boost your streaming numbers the most. Remember, you get paid per stream of each track - not each album. This huge-track count trick can naturally be used by lesser-known folk too\r\n\r\nAs they conclude, albeit perhaps with rather rose-tinted spectacles on:\r\n\r\n>Never before has a song title or artist name been more important than the actual songs themselves.\r\n>...\r\n>Never before have so many songs existed just so an album can have a 20th, 30th, or 40th track\r\n\r\nOverall they list 11 ways they've noticed artists adapting to Spotify's incentives:\r\n\r\n- The Happy Birthday gimmick mentioned above. Who wouldn't want to listen to a song entitled \"Happy Birthday whatever-your-name-is\"?\r\n- Writing songs about everything someone might conceivably search for; their example being \"the song “Have You Been to Radnor Township?” on the 93-track album Pennsylvania Songs: PA Exiting\". \r\n- Releasing multiple albums with the same songs, often titled differently.\r\n- Release an absolutely silent \"song\".\r\n- Convincing people to get their computers to fake-listen to the song.\r\n- \"Filling the void\" - releasing covers of songs from famous artists who aren't on Spotify.\r\n- Trying to trick people by naming their songs very similarly to more famous ones. Someone searching for Imagine Dragon's song \"Demons\" might not realise they accidentally clicked on the 1-hit wonder Imagine Demon's song \"Demons\".\r\n- Covering everything famous, all the time.\r\n- Adding unnessecary extra tracks to albums as noted above.\r\n- Putting your past popular singles in your new album.\r\n- Seeding popular Spotify playlists with fake artists - something Spotify has been accused of doing, more on this below.\r\n\r\nOK, so is it all greedy users exploiting the opportunities the likes of Spotify inadvertently make available to them? No, it is not. It's easy to go too far in absolving the platforms for their responsibility for this. \r\n\r\nFor one, it's 2023. We know how these things go. Everything product decision is a choice. The big platforms decide where to prioritise their development. They decide what they accept and how. If some of the above isn't what the platforms want to promote then surely if users can find it easily enough to repeatedly write articles about the issue then so could they, given their access to reams of confidential internal data. \r\n\r\nIn fact they do, sometimes. \r\n\r\nEarlier this year Spotify [removed thousands of AI generated songs](https://gizmodo.com/spotify-ai-music-generator-purges-bots-listening-songs-1850419032) from its catalogue. Many were those autogenerated by [Boomy](https://boomy.com/) - a site that sells itself as enabling you to \"Create original songs in seconds, even if you've never made music before\" and \" Submit your songs to streaming platforms and get paid when people listen\". \r\n\r\nNow as with many generative AI tools, it may not be a bad thing in principle. It might enable people who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to create their own music be able to, in the same way as the image generators could allow expressions of novel creativity otherwise unavailable to most. But it's also catnip for folk that care more for income than art.\r\n\r\n## Robots are creating music for robots to listen to\r\n\r\nSo why did Spotify go on a deleting rampage of these tracks? Not particularly because they weren't a great experience for the average user. And there's certainly no prohibition on using AI to write or help write one's music. \r\n\r\nRather it was because the people *listening* to that music were fake. Remember that Spotify pays out based on how many people listen to your tracks. So \"creators\" built bots that  \"listened\" to the tracks again and again. It's essentially fraud, given the terms of service. \r\n\r\nSo in a somewhat dystopian-feeling loop, people are using AI to create music that is mostly listened to by other AIs, no humans involved. \r\n\r\nThe business model and recommendation algorithms of the mainstream music streaming platforms - quantity over quality, quantity over everything - makes them as vulnerable to [clickfarms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm) as any other type of site that provides some kind of reward for attracting lots of traffic of any kind. In this case Spotify has to pay for it directly, which is finally enough of a reason for them to act on it.\r\n\r\nPeople are trying to measure these fake listeners. A French government organisation reported [that 1-3% of all French streams](https://www.billboard.com/pro/fake-music-streams-france-1-billion-2021-report/) in 2021 were fraudulent based on data from Spotify, Deezer and Qobuz. This is likely an underestimate due to the use of VPNs and the like.\r\n\r\n[Beatdapp](https://beatdapp.com/), a company who sells a tool that looks for streaming fraud so is admittedly incentivised to claim that there's a lot of it, wrote that at least 10% of all streaming activity in 2022 was fraudulent. That's equivalent to $2 billion of revenue illegitimately extracted. They believe that it'll be worth $7.5 billion by 2030 if it is not stopped.\r\n\r\nThe fact that more streams = more money has also been more publicly exploited in the past. [Eternify was a service that lets users input the name of their favourite artists](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/) and it'd play their songs on repeat for exactly 30 seconds each on Spotify. 30 seconds was the threshold at which the artist gets paid, so this was a way you could optimise the income of your preferred musicians without the obstacle of having to actually listen to their output. The site would slowly count up the revenue your mouse-click had accrued for them. \r\n\r\nIt seems to be have been more of a protest statement from some understandably disenchanted musicians than something that aimed to enable fraudsters. And it probably wouldn't have saved many starving artists without a truly mass takeup. [Forbes calculated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/) that using it for a solid day would generate perhaps $1.44 for the artist in question. In any case, it cost Spotify directly enough to make them go to the effort of [shutting it down](https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/06/26/spotify-shuts-down-royalty-boosting-scheme-eternify/).\r\n\r\n## The \"pay\" most musicians receive from the service is incredibly low\r\n\r\nThe $1.44 a day figure reveals another not-so-hidden truth. These services are really not paying out a lot of money to the creators of what they're selling access to. So much so that even a committee of British MPs - a group [not particularly known](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html) for its sympathy or [care for artists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/30/the-guardian-view-on-cuts-to-arts-funding-a-calamity-that-must-be-averted) - are [worried about it](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473). \r\n\r\nFrom all that revenue you're providing to the streaming services, the folk involved in producing the music are receiving about 16% of it.\r\n\r\nSpotify is thought to be paying out between £0.002 and £0.0038 every time you play a stream. Apple Music pays a bit more, a whopping £0.0059. Youtube a bit less, about £0.00052.\r\n\r\nAnd \"pays out\" is doing a lot of work there, as even many of the reports about \"Spotify only pays artists £x\" seem to miss. That 0.2 pence has got to be divided up between anyone with interests or rights to the music, as well as each member of the band, the composer, the writers, and so on. \r\n\r\nThe BBC [provides an infographic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473) to help us visualise what that means.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/119425053-stream-revenue-640-2x-nc.png.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"738\" alt=\"A diagram showing where the revenue paid out from streaming goes\">\r\n\r\nI don't think that the recording industry was particularly renowned for being favourable to artists even before the streaming revolution. Anyway, all in all, the recording artist(s) often might expect to receive about 13% of that 0.2p. Under a third of a penny.\r\n\r\nThirds of pennies don't add up fast. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musician's Union suggested that over 80% of musicians made less than £200 a year from streaming during 2019. 93% didn't break the £1000 milestone. \r\n\r\nSure, the megastars might earn substantially more than enough to survive on, but even their entourage aren't necessarily doing well. The writer of one of the songs on Kylie Minogue's number-one charting album \"Disco\" reported receiving £100.\r\n\r\n>\"Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,\" she told MPs. \"It's quite shameful.\"\r\n\r\n## Spotify seems to be gaming its own platform\r\n\r\nBack to the fake streams. As wrong as it is, let's not feel *too* sorry for some of the platforms subject to this streaming fraud. Spotify's seeming attempts to game it's own system at the expense of other artists and their own users have been written about elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere's the time it was found to be [burying songs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/spotify-said-to-retaliate-against-artists-with-apple-exclusives?leadSource=uverify%20wall) from musicians because they'd also made deals with their rivals. Maybe that's understandable, maybe not, but I'd guess most users don't understand that to be what's going on when they search for a song.\r\n\r\nWhat's even less obvious is that sometimes Spotify decides to pay producers a flat fee to create tracks such that Spotify owns the copyright. They then upload them to their own serivce under fake artist names, people that don't exist. Why?\r\n\r\nFrom [Music Business Worldwide](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-creating-its-own-recordings-and-putting-them-on-playlists/):\r\n\r\n>Why would Spotify be instructing producers to write and record tracks of this nature?\r\n>\r\n>Bingo: to appear on some of its relaxing first-party playlists, which boast millions of followers between them.\r\n\r\nNow they don't seem to get anything like as many plays as the most popular songs on the platform so it's not something that's necessarily dominating the user experience. But each time users plays a track from one of these fake artists Spotify only has to pay itself the stream royalties. Over 50 fake artists of this kind [have been found](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-spotifys-fake-artists-problem-is-an-epidemic-literally/) now, almost all of which have had millions of streams. \r\n\r\nAs ever, it's not entirely a black and white issue. Spotify have explicitly denied some (but perhaps not all) of these allegations. And, in this case, behind the fake artists are real people playing real music. They're just paid in a way much more favourable to Spotify at scale than other artists, and they seem to have an automatic route to being included in much-coveted very popular playlists. \r\n\r\nSpotify curated playlists apparently account for [around a third](https://bandzoogle.com/blog/how-to-get-your-music-featured-on-spotify-playlists) what's listened to on the platform in terms of time. To get onto one of them, most musicians have to actively [pitch their music](https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/) for inclusion, one song at a time, before the song has been released. Most of the pitches, [around 80%](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/behind-the-playlists-your-questions-answered-by-our-playlist-editors), are turned down without explanation.\r\n\r\nArguably, similar dynamics exist in other types of streaming services. Netflix does of course make its own shows which it heavily promotes on its own service. But as a user it does feel disingenuous to me at least. Why not label these tracks as having been produced by Spotify? Why not explain how they got onto the playlists? \r\n\r\nBased on some patent applications, some folk [seem to think](https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/spotify-could-soon-replace-real-artists-with-ai-music) that eventually Spotify might take the human out of the creation process altogether, potentially filling its playlists with music they generated themselves via AI. Presumably competing against those independent users uploading their own AI music, albeit with potentially a thumb on the scale.\r\n\r\n## Enshittification, yet again\r\n\r\nPlatforms such as Spotify appear to potentially provide great examples of Doctorow's [theory of enshittification](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html). When they first launched they appeared provided incredible value for users, revolutionary in some ways. You could access literally millions of much-sought after music for a relatively low monthly cost - or even free on Spotify at least if you were happy to tolerate adverts - entirely on demand. A radio station perfectly attuned to your minute-by-minute preferences. A way to experience far more of the musical art than [you could ever afford](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html) to if you were paying £12.99+ for an individual album like ye olde days. An experience much safer and easier, not to mention less criminal and more conducive to rewarding musicians than yesteryear's internet underground [piracy scene](https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/).\r\n\r\nAs [The New Yorker wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lofty-optimism-of-spotify-and-the-influence-of-the-streaming-revolution) about Spotify 5 years ago:\r\n\r\n>The company is essentially insisting that freer and easier access to music is the only thing that matters; everything should be available to everyone, because freedom of choice is an essential freedom.\r\n\r\nThe platforms attracted so many listeners with this fabulous promise that they became attractive, perhaps essential, to artists. Even many of the very rich very famous names who have sworn off Spotify at some point in time [came](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat) [back](https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/thom-yorke-solo-albums-back-on-spotify.html), presumably for the audience and its impact on the charts. If you weren't popular on Spotify then you'd not so much hope of ever topping the bill, attracting the most revenue, being the most famous.\r\n\r\nOr maybe they'd even enable vast numbers of people to realise their artistic dreams in a way they'd otherwise never have been able to. As [they wrote 4 years ago](https://pennyfractions.ghost.io/spotify-s-revolutionary-plan-to-support-one-million-artists/):\r\n\r\n>“the goal of our marketplace strategy is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work.”\r\n\r\nBut now, in the final stage, the platforms claw back more and more of the value for themselves.\r\n\r\nThey stop gaining marketshare only by virtue of being [able to sustain periods of loss](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/02/will-spotify-ever-turn-a-profit/).  They [change the user interface](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630821/spotify-design-home-music-podcasts-audiobooks-app) longer than their competitors. What's promoted, when and how becomes something less aligned with the reasons that many users may have originally signed up. They try to make it inconvenient for either [users](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/how-to-quit-spotify-and-what-you-give-up-if-you-do.html) or [creators](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/03/why-artists-leaving-spotify/) to leave, and costly for artists to make deals with competitors.  They acquire potential future competitors or expand into adjacent-ish markets to [increase the perceived lock-in](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/spotify-needs-to-profit-from-a-music-revolution/2023/01/18/e71c548c-96ef-11ed-a173-61e055ec24ef_story.html). They [raise prices](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021) - although some believe that the recent near-universal streaming price rises in conjunction with a cost-of-living crisis is resulting in [an increase in piracy](https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2023/10/30/online-piracy-streaming). They alter recommendation algorithms, alter incentives. \r\n\r\nAll very logical from the point of view of shareholder value et al, at least in the short term. It's not necessarily driven by maliciousness; I'm sure many of Spotify's employees love music, love musicians, embrace that vision of enabling a million artists to live off their work. It's just that at the end of the day the company's own incentive is all about coming up with the financial arrangements that most benefit themselves in the marketplace, whether or not it's at the expense of either or both sides of the user-creator relationship that's the fundamental reason that they can exist in the first place. \r\n\r\n## The tools shape us\r\n\r\nIt's more amorphous to define and subjective to evaluate, but perhaps these services have significantly changed how we tend to consume music beyond the technical side of things. McLuhan and Culkin's quotes apply on the demand side too. The medium is the message. We shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us.\r\n\r\nIn days of yore, listeners would usually have to invest financially in a specific number of physical instantiations of music; a cassette tape, a CD or an LP album amongst other formats. In the iPod era this moved onto digital downloads, but still at the level of purchasing individual songs rather than access to a smorgasbord of (a somewhat misleading perception of) everything everywhere, all at once, all the time.\r\n\r\nFor most people this put a limit on how much music they had access to. This seems prima facie bad at first glance, and perhaps it is. But maybe it also encouraged folk to spend more time and intention in choosing what they listened to, more time exploring any one individual work.  I expect a fair proportion of people don't even know what they recently listened to when they've opened their app at the start of the day and hit the \"especially for you\" playlist.\r\n\r\nWhen [the Guardian talked to a bunch of people](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music) who'd moved from streaming music back to more traditional forms of consumption they found some examples of this. Here's Lethem:\r\n\r\n>[With streaming] there’s endless accessibility, but you’re not really listening to anything. At least that’s what it started feeling like to me. I’m experiencing so much music, but am I really listening to any of it?\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't like what the algo chose then you can just hit skip 5 seconds in and be provided with something else that tries to hook you in. And it'll continue forever. There's no real concept of sitting down to appreciate an album end-to-end when the album is a literally endless playlist.\r\n\r\nMany of these services do let you listen by album of course, at least if you pay them for that ability. I'd be curious to know how many people still do that. It's certainly not the style of listening I feel like I see most heavily encouraged by the apps. Similar to the Youtube and Netflix style next-episode auto-play, the last thing they want to do is make you think you \"finished\" something to the extent you close the app. \r\n\r\nFairly incredibly, Spotify even used to default to shuffling the tracks of the album you selected into a random order [before Adele requested they stopped doing that](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/21/spotify-hides-shuffle-button-adele-albums-should-tell-a-story) because, of course, there is usually a reason why the tracks were put in that order in the first place. To quote her:\r\n\r\n>We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended.\r\n\r\nSome more conceptual albums would surely simply make very little sense out of order.\r\n\r\nSo hey, it's not like Spotify *never* listens to feedback, at least from megastars. Although even now you do have to be a paying customer of Spotify in order to be given the privilege of a \"play in the proper order\" button.\r\n\r\nMore recently Amazon actually [went in the opposite direction](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-music-alexa-restrictions-shuffle-11674054533) for its basic music streaming service. Subscribers to Amazon Prime, a service that costs around £9 a month and offers a variety of benefits to Amazon customers including music streaming, found that instead of the previous behaviour of being to choose what they listen to, when they requested music by a particular artist they would get a single track from that artist followed by a load of tracks from other people. Even their manually customised playlists started to shuffle around.\r\n\r\nAn unhappy customer reports his confusion:\r\n\r\n>Mr. McKenna, who lives near Albany, N.Y., spent years curating Amazon Music playlists....Recently, the app began playing a rock song he had never heard. When he got to the office, he tried to click on a Kenny Chesney song in his playlist, but it didn’t work. Songs he didn’t recognize kept playing.\r\n\r\nFor Bob, his chronologically-defined playlists not any more being chronological was enough to drive him back to CDs and Windows Media Player - \"It's like I've gone back to 2005\". The only way to keep hold of your Amazon Music collection and listen to what you want to when you want to now became to upgrade to the more expensive \"Amazon Unlimited\" service.\r\n\r\nShifts in people's listening choices are certainly not all about these services removing features that were once there. Even where you can in theory still choose to listen to exactly what you want, here's Nick from the [previously-mentioned Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music) confirming a shift in his behaviour he experienced soon after switching to streaming that I suspect is quite common:\r\n\r\n>I found myself selecting more and more just one-off songs from an artist, whereas before I’d been inclined to save a whole album\r\n\r\nThe obvious \"discovery\" alternative 20 years ago was to listen to the radio or a TV channel like MTV where for the most part you are subjected to other people's musical selections. From beginning to end, with no skip button. This might let you discover something so new and wonderful that you - and your 2023 recommendation algorithm - would never have considered if left to your own devices. On the other hand you had to listen to a lot of dross you didn't like, and would perhaps never happen to be listening at the right time to hear songs you were more likely to enjoy  - so again, nothing here is all good or all bad. But it's worth thinking about.\r\n\r\nFinlay, in [the same Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music), spoke to the issue above:\r\n\r\n>With streaming, he says: “If I didn’t gel with an album or an artist’s work at first, I tended not to go back to it.” But he realised that a lot of his all-time favourite albums were ones that grew on him over time. “Streaming was actually contributing to some degree of dismissal of new music.”\r\n\r\nJared speaks to both upsides and downsides:\r\n\r\n>My musical experiences definitely feel more dedicated and focused. It’s not as convenient. I’ll reluctantly admit that I listen to less music. Although on Spotify, I wasn’t necessarily listening to stuff. I was checking out the first 15 seconds and hitting skip. Now, I have to work for it and I like that. I can use the internet as a search tool but I’m not using it as a means to listen. I really have to seek things out and research.\r\n\r\nVirginia likewise, exhibiting a pattern I found myself adhering to at first:\r\n\r\n>I will listen to one song 100 times in a row, but I won’t give the rest of the album a chance. Before I used streaming services, I would listen to the whole thing.\r\n\r\nEven conceptually, the word \"streaming\" has connotations that may affect how we feel about what we're listening to.\r\n\r\n>Before there was streaming music, what else was streaming? This idea that you can just turn on a faucet, and out comes music. It’s something that leaves everyone to take it for granted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of these ex-streamer folk talked about the extra work they now had to do to find what they like. It can comes at a financial cost too, which risks making some of what I wrote seem elitist and gatekeepery as well as Ludditey. After all why should only people with time and wealth to spare have access to reasonable quantities of music? What's wrong with having convenient and cheap access to so much art? Nothing on the face of it, if we can find a business model that doesn't incentivise its enshittification and abuse of the creators. \r\n\r\n## Streaming isn't necessarily cheap, and you end up owning nothing\r\n\r\nAlthough I would note that for the moderately well-off that it's not clear to me that paying for a year of Spotify is necessarily cheaper than buying a few albums that mean something to you. Right now, Spotify paid edition would cost you £131.88 a year. That would also buy you a good amount of singles, albums, whatever you're into. That might well suit people who prefer to or simply happen to end up listening to a certain subset of everything repeatedly. And it's almost certainly better for the artists concerned.\r\n\r\nIt also means your music becomes \"yours\". You can keep a CD or, let's be realistic given it's 2023, an MP3 or lossless music file whether or not you want to keep subscribing to any given service. I've been an Apple Music subscriber in my time, and I liked the service. But assuming one day you will choose to, or be forced to, stop paying the company the monthly fee then it's all gone. If I want to switch to a different service then it's a faff. Copying your favourite playlists, likes, subscribes, downloads et al  to a new place isn't necessarily easy - the new service may even be missing some of your tracks. And moving your carefully refined recommendation algorithms across services isn't on anyone's radar at all and probably won't ever be; it's each company's secret sauce.\r\n\r\nYou also certainly can't give your collection or pieces of it to anyone. You can't give what you don't own. I can't find it now, but I remember reading a story about the joy and meaning someone got from inheriting the music collection of their sadly recently-deceased father; the feelings and memories that listening to what he'd collected over a lifetime evoked. But that's something that likely becomes unavailable with a shift to streaming.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any documentation about what happens to someone's music streaming account when they die, outside of [several posts on the Spotify forums](https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&allow_punctuation=false&filter=location&location=forum-board:spotifyaccountrelated&q=deceased) that mainly end in \"try asking customer services\". But it's surely not something that someone inherits> If you don't know the person's password and can open to their email then access may be gone for good. If it's a pay-for service then I imagine every trace of it simply vanishes as soon as the credit card fails to bill.\r\n\r\nTalking about dying is admittedly a little dramatic. But there are other ways your favoured streaming services might be denied to you even whilst alive. Services close, even ones from [hugely successful companies](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-play-music-will-shutdown-completely-in-december-heres-how-to-save-your-music)\r\n\r\n>Say goodbye to Google Play Music, the service will be going away for good in December 2020 and with it, all your music if you don't transfer it over.\r\n\r\nAre you old enough to remember [Rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio)? [Beats Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Music)? [Yahoo Music Unlimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Music_Unlimited)? Or any of the other 20-30 services currently listed on Wikipedia in [its \"Discontinued services\" section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services#Discontinued_services), either entirely shut down or purchased by and replaced with the current handful of big players.\r\n\r\nOr you may simply lose access to your account. If Apple, Amazon, Spotify, or whoever you're with decide for some reason that they don't want you to have an account then it's all gone. The various chatboards of the internet are full of stories of people losing their accounts from the big tech firms. Oftentimes they're more concerned about their emails or photos than their music. But it's all the same. If Apple, Spotify or the rest of them decide you've been misbehaving, or can't be convinced that you are who you say you are, then whatever effort you've put into maintaining your collection is lost. I'd imagine it's probably rarer for this to happen with music streaming services than some categories - it's harder to imagine being accused of \"abusing\" a music streaming account but as many Reddit posts show, it's not impossible. \r\n\r\nFor the paid-only services, which is most of them, of course the same happens if your circumstances change such that you can no longer afford the service. And even if not, you're bound to implicitly supporting any changes in the streaming company's rules, strategies, personnel or ethics if you want to keep the music flowing. This might well be a price worth paying for many people, for most people. But it is a price. \r\n\r\nIf one of these eventualities does happen to you, then there are third-party services that try attempt to transfer your streaming collections and various metadata between one such service and another, although I haven't tried any of them out enough to know how well they work. But not if you already lost access to the service you want to move from. And of course they won't be able to transfer your playlists, likes et al to a service that doesn't have the particular track involved.\n",

Perhaps a true emissary of [Gen Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z) with possibly the somewhat [stereotypical Gen Z habits](https://www.kerrang.com/nessa-barrett-interview-hell-is-a-teenage-girl-tiktok-religion-mental-health-cover-story) of spending time staying in writing in her gratitude journal and doing tarot alongside her cat whilst releasing TikTok videos rather than the again stereotypical debauched and drunken lifestyles of such stars in former generations  \n\nSome of her ability to attract an incredible number of fans likely comes from her openness about [her mental health problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessa_Barrett#Personal_life). Sadly it sounds like she's suffered tremendously from a range of conditions. \n\nShe's also musically talented enough that posting her vids on TikTok led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers.\n\nI think I read somewhere that the concept behind much of this EP is to enumerate the stages one goes through after a rough relationship breakup - the incompatible thoughts one might have: reminiscing, happy memories, disgust, hatred, caring nothing, caring too much.

				"title": "Experiencing the Dream Machine",
				"content_html": "<p>Last week I got to go experience the <a href=\"https://dreamachine.world/\">Dream Machine</a> with a friend. The nature of the experience is such that I think it'&rsquo;ll be extraordinarily hard to convey via text, but I&rsquo;ll give it at least a weak go.</p>\n<p>The overall conceit of the project is that when placed in a dark room, a mix of flashing lights and sounds can alter your conscious experience. Or rather it  &ldquo;invites you on a magical journey to explore the extraordinary potential of your mind&rdquo; to quote their website.</p>\n<p>First up you start off in a room where past participants have attempted to draw what they experienced. You get to do the same when you&rsquo;re done, although my art skills are such that I didn&rsquo;t even try. Many of these pictures resemble colourful geometric patterns or bright fields of light. A handful appear to contain human-looking objects, perhaps aliens, that kind of thing, especially exciting to me. You can see some of these <a href=\"https://dreamachine.world/dream-grid/\">pictures on their their website</a>. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Next up they relieve you of your phone and other devices and, unexpectedly, your shoes. You&rsquo;re issued a bag that contains some hotel-style slippers, an eye mask and a blanket. There&rsquo;s a short safety talk to check everyone&rsquo;s willing and ready. The default experience is not suitable for people with sensitivity to flashing lights (precluding folk with some forms of epilepsy) or loud sounds. But they do have modified experiences available that should allow most people with those sensitivities to proceed if you let them know that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re led into a kind of inside tent with maybe 10-12 people to sit space d out on a large circular sofa type thing. The back of it is slanted such that you&rsquo;re half lying down. Two speakers surround your head. There&rsquo;s a big white spherical thing on the ceiling, which is the soon-to-be-flashing light. Your bag&rsquo;s blanket is for if you&rsquo;re a bit cold. The eye-mask is for you to put on if the experience starts to feel temporarily too much.</p>\n<p>More safety briefing and confirmations that one is ready to proceed are given. Whilst the supervisors aren&rsquo;t going to be in the room with you when the experience starts they must be watching you I suppose as the deal is that if you need help you should wave and they&rsquo;ll come help you. All this is either a bit off-putting or a bit exciting depending your constitution, I definitely felt the latter.</p>\n<p>Two key facts include that 1) you should keep your eyes shut throughout the experience if you can and 2) no matter what you think is going on out there they promise that all they&rsquo;re actually doing is flashing a white light at various intervals. Anything else you perceive is coming entirely from the mysterious world of your brain.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s a little taster session just to make sure everyone is OK with the actual experience rather than a description of it. The room goes dark, you close your eyes and a prerecorded audio grounding starts. If you&rsquo;ve done certain types of meditation (including the app types) it&rsquo;s that kind of thing. Focus on your breath, your body, and so on. Then the sounds start, slightly ethereal music for the most part. And through your closed eyes you can tell the light must be turning on as a kind of brightness changes your eye-closed perception, similarly to how you know whether it&rsquo;s a sunny day or the middle of the night when you wake up each day but can&rsquo;t be bothered to open your eyes.</p>\n<p>Then a few minutes of presumably flickering lights, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, wherein you get a taste of what&rsquo;s to come.

				"content_text": "Last week I got to go experience the [Dream Machine](https://dreamachine.world/) with a friend. The nature of the experience is such that I think it''ll be extraordinarily hard to convey via text, but I'll give it at least a weak go.\r\n\r\nThe overall conceit of the project is that when placed in a dark room, a mix of flashing lights and sounds can alter your conscious experience. Or rather it  \"invites you on a magical journey to explore the extraordinary potential of your mind\" to quote their website.\r\n\r\nFirst up you start off in a room where past participants have attempted to draw what they experienced. You get to do the same when you're done, although my art skills are such that I didn't even try. Many of these pictures resemble colourful geometric patterns or bright fields of light. A handful appear to contain human-looking objects, perhaps aliens, that kind of thing, especially exciting to me. You can see some of these [pictures on their their website](https://dreamachine.world/dream-grid/). Here's an example:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/dreammachine.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Picture of what someone saw in the Dream Machine\">\r\n \r\nNext up they relieve you of your phone and other devices and, unexpectedly, your shoes. You're issued a bag that contains some hotel-style slippers, an eye mask and a blanket. There's a short safety talk to check everyone's willing and ready. The default experience is not suitable for people with sensitivity to flashing lights (precluding folk with some forms of epilepsy) or loud sounds. But they do have modified experiences available that should allow most people with those sensitivities to proceed if you let them know that's what you're after.\r\n\r\nYou're led into a kind of inside tent with maybe 10-12 people to sit space d out on a large circular sofa type thing. The back of it is slanted such that you're half lying down. Two speakers surround your head. There's a big white spherical thing on the ceiling, which is the soon-to-be-flashing light. Your bag's blanket is for if you're a bit cold. The eye-mask is for you to put on if the experience starts to feel temporarily too much. \r\n\r\nMore safety briefing and confirmations that one is ready to proceed are given. Whilst the supervisors aren't going to be in the room with you when the experience starts they must be watching you I suppose as the deal is that if you need help you should wave and they'll come help you. All this is either a bit off-putting or a bit exciting depending your constitution, I definitely felt the latter. \r\n\r\nTwo key facts include that 1) you should keep your eyes shut throughout the experience if you can and 2) no matter what you think is going on out there they promise that all they're actually doing is flashing a white light at various intervals. Anything else you perceive is coming entirely from the mysterious world of your brain.\r\n\r\nThen there's a little taster session just to make sure everyone is OK with the actual experience rather than a description of it. The room goes dark, you close your eyes and a prerecorded audio grounding starts. If you've done certain types of meditation (including the app types) it's that kind of thing. Focus on your breath, your body, and so on. Then the sounds start, slightly ethereal music for the most part. And through your closed eyes you can tell the light must be turning on as a kind of brightness changes your eye-closed perception, similarly to how you know whether it's a sunny day or the middle of the night when you wake up each day but can't be bothered to open your eyes.\r\n\r\nThen a few minutes of presumably flickering lights, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, wherein you get a taste of what's to come. The taster experience soon ends. The supervisors return and check that everyone is fine to proceed. Everyone was, so the main experience begins, again with the grounding.\r\n\r\nThis main course is a lot longer. I'm not actually sure how long. Maybe 20 minutes? It's not like us humans are particularly good at keeping track of time in our heads even when at our most connected to stark reality, which in this experience is not really the case. \r\n\r\nThe sounds start, the light flashes, on and off, fast and slow, and your mind does what it does.

Sometimes not.

				"title": "The trials and tribulations of installing Linux Mint alongside Windows 10",
				"content_html": "<p>Over the past couple of days I&rsquo;ve managed to install <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/07/the-call-of.html\">Linux Mint</a> onto my Windows 10 computer. The last straw for Windows was when <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/\">it advertised</a> some story about how great Wetherspoons is to me when all I wanted to do was open some software. My computer also is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/\">prohibited by Microsoft</a> from upgrading to Windows 11 (it is old&hellip;but runs Windows 10 just fine) so at some point in the possibly distant future I imagine that could have caused me a problem. I&rsquo;d also like to move more and more towards open source software, at least for my personal computing.</p>\n<p>Below is what I did. It didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as I&rsquo;d hoped to be honest. I probably made it more difficult than I needed to for myself to be fair, and Windows played tricks on me too. But in the end it seems to be working well I&rsquo;m writing it here in case I need to do it again or someone else encounters the same obstacles.</p>\n<p>So there are various ways you can install Linux Mint on a computer that currently has Windows on it. That includes starting afresh, deleting everything you already have, Windows and all, and going 100% Linux. You can also use Linux Mint inside Windows using a virtual machine without having to do anything to Windows - it acts just like another piece of software you install in Windows, but has the obvious memory and processing overhead of having to run Windows and Linux simultaneously. You can also use it entirely from a USB drive. But I chose to go with probably the trickiest of options dual-booting.</p>\n<p>The idea here is that in the end what should happen is that each time my computer turns on it gives me a menu letting me choose whether I want to use Windows or Linux. I thus can choose between Windows and Linux each run and they&rsquo;ll act independently of each other. The natural cost is that you need to dedicate a certain amount of disk space to both operating systems and any files you want to use in them - but it&rsquo;s better than having to buy a whole new computer. It&rsquo;s also proved more tricky to set up than I imagine the other options would have been, although I do lay some of the blame at Windows' feet whilst  sucking up a decent chunk of it as being down to my own ignorance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-and-validate-the-linux-mint-install-software\">Get and validate the Linux Mint install software</h2>\n<p>Step 1 was to <a href=\"https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/choose.html\">download</a> the ISO file containing the Linux Mint image I wanted to install. I went with the &ldquo;Cinnamon 64bit&rdquo; version. Also get the sha256sum.txt and sha256sum.txt.gpg files from relevant Linux Mint download page (<a href=\"https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=305\">this</a> was the edition I used) which lets us verify the integrity of the ISO file later.</p>\n<p>Once downloaded, verify the file by comparing hashes. I only had access to Windows so per <a href=\"https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=291093\">these instructions</a> I downloaded <a href=\"https://www.gnupg.org/\">GnuPG</a> - the &ldquo;Simple installer for the current Gnu PG&rdquo; from <a href=\"https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Then to check the integrity if the ISO:</p>\n<p>Open a command prompt (PowerShell) in the folder I downloaded those to and ran \n<code>CertUtil -hashfile linuxmint-21.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso SHA256</code></p>\n<p>Check that the results matched the sha256sum.txt file.</p>\n<p>To check authenticity:</p>\n<p>Run <code>gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-key 27DEB15644C6B3CF3BD7D291300F846BA25BAE09</code></p>\n<p>Then:\n<code>gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt</code></p>\n<p>And check that the output says &ldquo;Good signature from &ldquo;Linux Mint ISO Signing Key <a href=\"mailto:root@linuxmint.com\">root@linuxmint.com</a>&rdquo; and the primary key fingerprint at the bottom matches the 27DE&hellip;. code from the first <code>gpg</code> output. Don&rsquo;t worry about the warning about the key not being certified.</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-a-bootable-linux-usb-stick\">Make a bootable Linux USB stick</h2>\n<p>Now we need to to make a bootable USB stick from the ISO image. First find a USB disk you don&rsquo;t mind emptying out as this will remove any existing files on it. After that, <a href=\"https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html\">here are the instructions</a>.  For Windows they suggest you install <a href=\"https://etcher.balena.io/\">Etcher</a>. I downloaded Etcher for Windows Portable Edition but presumably any should work.</p>\n<p>In Etcher, choose to &ldquo;Flash from file&rdquo; and select the ISO image you downloaded in the first step.\nThen &ldquo;Select Target&rdquo; to choose your USB drive (after plugging it in, and remembering that you&rsquo;ll lose any data on it). Then select to flash the drive and wait a few minutes until it’s finished.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prepare-disk-space-for-linux-to-install-to\">Prepare disk space for Linux to install to</h2>\n<p>Next up we&rsquo;ll need to create a partition for Linux Mint to install to. Probably your disk is already partitioned 100% for Windows. I needed to reduce the size of the Windows partition and create a new one with space from Linux.</p>\n<p>Although the instructions for Linux Mint read to me like you can do this during the Linux Mint install process, most of the info I read on the internet suggested to do it first in Windows, with the Windows specific tool, given you&rsquo;re messing around with a Windows partition. This is &ldquo;fiddling around with hard disks&rdquo; type stuff, so everyone recommends that you back up anything important before doing it just in case either you or Windows does it wrong and lose it all.</p>\n<p>Then I did the below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the built-in app &ldquo;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-in-disk-management-ad88ba19-f0d3-0809-7889-830f63e94405\">Disk Management</a>&rdquo; in Windows - one way to get to this is open the Start Menu and start typing &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; until the option to &ldquo;Create and format hard disk partitions&rdquo; comes up.</li>\n<li>Right click the disk you want to &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; in order to make a Linux partition. For me this was the one labelled &ldquo;C:&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>Choose &ldquo;Shrink volume&rdquo;</li>\n<li>It asks you to input the &ldquo;amount of space to shrink&rdquo; in MB. I decided to give Linux 100GB to use for now so typed in 100000 and clicked &ldquo;Shrink&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>A while later the Disk Management screen updated to show a 97.66GB unallocated space. Seems like I should have remembered that 100000 MB doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equal 100 GB if I wanted rounder numbers. But this will do for now.</li>\n<li>Note that of course whatever you &ldquo;unallocate&rdquo; here won&rsquo;t be accessible to Windows. So you need to have a decent amount of free disk space to go this dual boot way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reboot-from-your-usb-drive\">Reboot from your USB drive</h2>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to boot up the bootable USB we created and install Linux into this free space.</p>\n<p>First I checked the BIOS to make sure my computer could boot from a USB. For my old Sony laptop this meant turning it off and then holding down the special button marked &ldquo;ASSIST&rdquo; and choosing &ldquo;Start from media&rdquo;. For most less weirdly proprietary computers I think that&rsquo;s usually case of looking at your <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings\">BIOS settings</a> to make sure your computer is set to boot from USB drive before your hard disk and then rebooting it.</p>\n<p>Start it up again with the USB drive you prepared earlier plugged in. If you set the boot options correctly you will get a menu. I chose &lsquo;Start Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon 64-bit&rsquo;’'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"start-the-linux-mint-installation-wizard\">Start the Linux Mint installation wizard</h2>\n<p>After a few minutes and some slightly scary looking error messages I ignored it loaded up to a Linux Mint desktop. I double clicked the Install Linux Mint icon.</p>\n<p>In the subsequent wizards, select your language, keyboard. I chose the option to ‘Install multimedia codecs’ which meant I had to configure secure boot by choosing a password as  I apparently have UEFI secure boot enabled.</p>\n<p>I think this stage later gave me problems. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure this is why but I read somewhere that your keyboard will effectively be in US mode at the time of needing this password. So if you have a non-US keyboard then you might want to make the password pretty simple and not full of special characters. Letters and numbers worked for me. Note that you only need to use this password once.</p>\n<p>Next up in the install wizard, I chose &ldquo;Install Linux mint alongside windows boot manager&rdquo;. A message popped up explaining what changes it was going to make. It wasn’t all that helpful. But I <em>think</em> it did everything OK.  There is a &ldquo;Something else&rdquo; option if you prefer to try and manually figure out / exert some control your partitions. Most internet guides seem to recommend that, but I must admit I did the &ldquo;install alongside&rdquo; option.</p>\n<p>Next up I chose my time zone, and chose a username, password, computer name and chose to encrypt my home folder. This password is the one you&rsquo;ll use to log onto Linux Mint every time so make sure you can remember it. The system then started to install.</p>\n<p>I then let it restart the computer, removing the USB when it told me too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manage-your-moks-\">Manage your MOKs (?)</h2>\n<p>A blue &ldquo;MOK management&rdquo; screen appeared. I had no idea what this meant. I think what I should have done was to choose the &ldquo;Enroll MOK&rdquo; which was the second option I was presented with, view the key and choose to &ldquo;Enroll key&rdquo;. The password is the first password we recorded above, the one to do with the multimedia codecs.</p>\n<p>However I had little idea what any of this meant so by the time I got to it it had timed out and automatically picked the first option which was to continue the normal boot process. This loaded up Linux Mint but I&rsquo;m led to believe this meant the multimedia codecs and maybe some other stuff wouldn&rsquo;t work. You really want to enroll the MOK.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s a one time prompt - reboot and you&rsquo;ll not get a chance to enroll the MOK key again. Oh no! But there is a way to reset this and get the MOK key prompt to come back.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-the-mok-enrollment-screen-to-come-back-if-like-me-you-did-it-wrong-the-first-time\">Getting the MOK enrollment screen to come back if like me you did it wrong the first time</h3>\n<p>Thank you to Philip from the 11th post <a href=\"https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/701448\">here</a> who documented that if you load up to Linux and type this into the command prompt:</p>\n<p><code>sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der</code></p>\n<p>Then the next time you restart you&rsquo;ll get that option to Enroll MOK again. Running the above will ask perhaps for your &ldquo;root&rdquo; password which is the second one you selected above and then for you to define a new password. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of the one-use first password we encountered above with the multimedia codecs. So probably make it fairly simple. It won&rsquo;t affect the password you log onto your computer with. But it&rsquo;s this one-use password you use to enroll your MOK.</p>\n<p>If feeling particularly committed, <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot\">this page</a> describes a bit more about what these keys and commands are for. If your computer isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; with SecureBoot then you may not see any of this.</p>\n<p>After that, all seemed well. Whenever I turned my computer on I could choose between Linux and Windows just like I wanted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"connecting-to-the-internet\">Connecting to the internet</h2>\n<p>At first the wifi didn&rsquo;t work, but once I went into the built-in Driver Manager in Linux Mint and inserted my install USB key when prompted. It scanned, found my wireless card, and when I selected the only option it gave me other than &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it&rdquo; that all started working well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-windows-forcibly-takes-over-again\">When Windows forcibly takes over again</h2>\n<p>I was glowing with success only for a few minutes until Windows turned nasty&hellip;.The first time I chose to load Windows it appeared to overwrite the startup menu where you choose between Linux and Windows. Apparently this is pretty normal. I guess Windows just can&rsquo;t believe that you don&rsquo;t want to 100% use it and its extremely undesirable Start Menu.</p>\n<p>So whilst I&rsquo;d successfully installed Linux Mint, after the first time I&rsquo;d loaded up Windows I wasn&rsquo;t given the option to actually use Linux ever again. Aaargh.</p>\n<p>The internet has a vast array of frustrated users and posts with helpful suggestions about what lengthy thing you should type in to where to hopefully sort this problem out. But not a single one of the ones I saw quite worked for me. However they did provide enough clues that I think I eventually got to  the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t say I fully understand everything I did here, and it&rsquo;s probably not very risk free for anyone with no backup, but here&rsquo;s what worked for me in case I ever need it again. Honestly though, unless you understand it better than me I wouldn&rsquo;t run it without having a great backup, a bit more research or an expert friend.</p>\n<p>First up, you&rsquo;ll need to get back into Linux however you can (remember you can most likely boot from your install USB if you&rsquo;ve no other way). Then open the command prompt (aka terminal) and run:</p>\n<p><code>efibootmgr -v</code></p>\n<p>I got a list showing the partitions that could boot and thee order that they&rsquo;d apparently do so in. One row for Windows and a couple for &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo;. One of these rows was my main Linux Mint install. The other is &ldquo;grub&rdquo; which is the menu system that lets you choose which OS to start when you turn your computer. Windows kept insisting on enabling itself and acting like it was first on the list no matter what I did whereas I needed the grub one to take precedence.

				"content_text": "Over the past couple of days I've managed to install [Linux Mint](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/07/the-call-of.html) onto my Windows 10 computer. The last straw for Windows was when [it advertised](https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/) some story about how great Wetherspoons is to me when all I wanted to do was open some software. My computer also is [prohibited by Microsoft](https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/) from upgrading to Windows 11 (it is old...but runs Windows 10 just fine) so at some point in the possibly distant future I imagine that could have caused me a problem. I'd also like to move more and more towards open source software, at least for my personal computing.\r\n\r\nBelow is what I did. It didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped to be honest. I probably made it more difficult than I needed to for myself to be fair, and Windows played tricks on me too. But in the end it seems to be working well I'm writing it here in case I need to do it again or someone else encounters the same obstacles.\r\n\r\nSo there are various ways you can install Linux Mint on a computer that currently has Windows on it. That includes starting afresh, deleting everything you already have, Windows and all, and going 100% Linux. You can also use Linux Mint inside Windows using a virtual machine without having to do anything to Windows - it acts just like another piece of software you install in Windows, but has the obvious memory and processing overhead of having to run Windows and Linux simultaneously. You can also use it entirely from a USB drive. But I chose to go with probably the trickiest of options dual-booting. \r\n\r\nThe idea here is that in the end what should happen is that each time my computer turns on it gives me a menu letting me choose whether I want to use Windows or Linux. I thus can choose between Windows and Linux each run and they'll act independently of each other. The natural cost is that you need to dedicate a certain amount of disk space to both operating systems and any files you want to use in them - but it's better than having to buy a whole new computer. It's also proved more tricky to set up than I imagine the other options would have been, although I do lay some of the blame at Windows' feet whilst  sucking up a decent chunk of it as being down to my own ignorance.\r\n\r\n## Get and validate the Linux Mint install software\r\n\r\nStep 1 was to [download](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/choose.html) the ISO file containing the Linux Mint image I wanted to install. I went with the \"Cinnamon 64bit\" version. Also get the sha256sum.txt and sha256sum.txt.gpg files from relevant Linux Mint download page ([this](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=305) was the edition I used) which lets us verify the integrity of the ISO file later.\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded, verify the file by comparing hashes. I only had access to Windows so per [these instructions](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=291093) I downloaded [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) - the \"Simple installer for the current Gnu PG\" from [here](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html).\r\n\r\nThen to check the integrity if the ISO:\r\n\r\nOpen a command prompt (PowerShell) in the folder I downloaded those to and ran \r\n`CertUtil -hashfile linuxmint-21.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso SHA256`\r\n\r\nCheck that the results matched the sha256sum.txt file.\r\n\r\nTo check authenticity:\r\n\r\nRun `gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-key 27DEB15644C6B3CF3BD7D291300F846BA25BAE09`\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n`gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt`\r\n\r\nAnd check that the output says \"Good signature from \"Linux Mint ISO Signing Key <root@linuxmint.com>\" and the primary key fingerprint at the bottom matches the 27DE.... code from the first `gpg` output. Don't worry about the warning about the key not being certified.\r\n\r\n## Make a bootable Linux USB stick\r\n\r\nNow we need to to make a bootable USB stick from the ISO image. First find a USB disk you don't mind emptying out as this will remove any existing files on it. After that, [here are the instructions](https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html).  For Windows they suggest you install [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/). I downloaded Etcher for Windows Portable Edition but presumably any should work.\r\n\r\nIn Etcher, choose to \"Flash from file\" and select the ISO image you downloaded in the first step.\r\nThen \"Select Target\" to choose your USB drive (after plugging it in, and remembering that you'll lose any data on it). Then select to flash the drive and wait a few minutes until it’s finished. \r\n\r\n## Prepare disk space for Linux to install to\r\n\r\nNext up we'll need to create a partition for Linux Mint to install to. Probably your disk is already partitioned 100% for Windows. I needed to reduce the size of the Windows partition and create a new one with space from Linux. \r\n\r\nAlthough the instructions for Linux Mint read to me like you can do this during the Linux Mint install process, most of the info I read on the internet suggested to do it first in Windows, with the Windows specific tool, given you're messing around with a Windows partition. This is \"fiddling around with hard disks\" type stuff, so everyone recommends that you back up anything important before doing it just in case either you or Windows does it wrong and lose it all.\r\n\r\nThen I did the below:\r\n\r\n- Open the built-in app \"[Disk Management](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-in-disk-management-ad88ba19-f0d3-0809-7889-830f63e94405)\" in Windows - one way to get to this is open the Start Menu and start typing \"Disk Management\" until the option to \"Create and format hard disk partitions\" comes up.\r\n- Right click the disk you want to \"shrink\" in order to make a Linux partition. For me this was the one labelled \"C:\".\r\n- Choose \"Shrink volume\"\r\n- It asks you to input the \"amount of space to shrink\" in MB. I decided to give Linux 100GB to use for now so typed in 100000 and clicked \"Shrink\".\r\n- A while later the Disk Management screen updated to show a 97.66GB unallocated space. Seems like I should have remembered that 100000 MB doesn't necessarily equal 100 GB if I wanted rounder numbers. But this will do for now.\r\n- Note that of course whatever you \"unallocate\" here won't be accessible to Windows. So you need to have a decent amount of free disk space to go this dual boot way.\r\n\r\n## Reboot from your USB drive\r\n\r\nNow it's time to boot up the bootable USB we created and install Linux into this free space. \r\n\r\nFirst I checked the BIOS to make sure my computer could boot from a USB. For my old Sony laptop this meant turning it off and then holding down the special button marked \"ASSIST\" and choosing \"Start from media\". For most less weirdly proprietary computers I think that's usually case of looking at your [BIOS settings](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings) to make sure your computer is set to boot from USB drive before your hard disk and then rebooting it.\r\n\r\nStart it up again with the USB drive you prepared earlier plugged in. If you set the boot options correctly you will get a menu. I chose 'Start Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon 64-bit'’'. \r\n\r\n## Start the Linux Mint installation wizard \r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes and some slightly scary looking error messages I ignored it loaded up to a Linux Mint desktop. I double clicked the Install Linux Mint icon. \r\n\r\nIn the subsequent wizards, select your language, keyboard. I chose the option to ‘Install multimedia codecs’ which meant I had to configure secure boot by choosing a password as  I apparently have UEFI secure boot enabled. \r\n\r\nI think this stage later gave me problems. I'm not 100% sure this is why but I read somewhere that your keyboard will effectively be in US mode at the time of needing this password. So if you have a non-US keyboard then you might want to make the password pretty simple and not full of special characters. Letters and numbers worked for me. Note that you only need to use this password once.\r\n\r\nNext up in the install wizard, I chose \"Install Linux mint alongside windows boot manager\". A message popped up explaining what changes it was going to make. It wasn’t all that helpful. But I *think* it did everything OK.  There is a \"Something else\" option if you prefer to try and manually figure out / exert some control your partitions. Most internet guides seem to recommend that, but I must admit I did the \"install alongside\" option.\r\n\r\nNext up I chose my time zone, and chose a username, password, computer name and chose to encrypt my home folder. This password is the one you'll use to log onto Linux Mint every time so make sure you can remember it. The system then started to install. \r\n\r\nI then let it restart the computer, removing the USB when it told me too. \r\n\r\n## Manage your MOKs (?)\r\n\r\nA blue \"MOK management\" screen appeared. I had no idea what this meant. I think what I should have done was to choose the \"Enroll MOK\" which was the second option I was presented with, view the key and choose to \"Enroll key\". The password is the first password we recorded above, the one to do with the multimedia codecs. \r\n\r\nHowever I had little idea what any of this meant so by the time I got to it it had timed out and automatically picked the first option which was to continue the normal boot process. This loaded up Linux Mint but I'm led to believe this meant the multimedia codecs and maybe some other stuff wouldn't work. You really want to enroll the MOK.\r\n\r\nBut it's a one time prompt - reboot and you'll not get a chance to enroll the MOK key again. Oh no! But there is a way to reset this and get the MOK key prompt to come back. \r\n\r\n### Getting the MOK enrollment screen to come back if like me you did it wrong the first time\r\n\r\nThank you to Philip from the 11th post [here](https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/701448) who documented that if you load up to Linux and type this into the command prompt:\r\n\r\n`sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der`\r\n\r\nThen the next time you restart you'll get that option to Enroll MOK again. Running the above will ask perhaps for your \"root\" password which is the second one you selected above and then for you to define a new password. That's the equivalent of the one-use first password we encountered above with the multimedia codecs. So probably make it fairly simple. It won't affect the password you log onto your computer with. But it's this one-use password you use to enroll your MOK.\r\n\r\nIf feeling particularly committed, [this page](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot) describes a bit more about what these keys and commands are for. If your computer isn't \"blessed\" with SecureBoot then you may not see any of this.\r\n\r\nAfter that, all seemed well. Whenever I turned my computer on I could choose between Linux and Windows just like I wanted. \r\n\r\n## Connecting to the internet\r\n\r\nAt first the wifi didn't work, but once I went into the built-in Driver Manager in Linux Mint and inserted my install USB key when prompted. It scanned, found my wireless card, and when I selected the only option it gave me other than \"don't use it\" that all started working well.\r\n\r\n## When Windows forcibly takes over again\r\n\r\nI was glowing with success only for a few minutes until Windows turned nasty....The first time I chose to load Windows it appeared to overwrite the startup menu where you choose between Linux and Windows. Apparently this is pretty normal. I guess Windows just can't believe that you don't want to 100% use it and its extremely undesirable Start Menu. \r\n\r\nSo whilst I'd successfully installed Linux Mint, after the first time I'd loaded up Windows I wasn't given the option to actually use Linux ever again. Aaargh. \r\n\r\nThe internet has a vast array of frustrated users and posts with helpful suggestions about what lengthy thing you should type in to where to hopefully sort this problem out. But not a single one of the ones I saw quite worked for me. However they did provide enough clues that I think I eventually got to  the bottom of it. \r\n\r\nI can't say I fully understand everything I did here, and it's probably not very risk free for anyone with no backup, but here's what worked for me in case I ever need it again. Honestly though, unless you understand it better than me I wouldn't run it without having a great backup, a bit more research or an expert friend. \r\n\r\nFirst up, you'll need to get back into Linux however you can (remember you can most likely boot from your install USB if you've no other way). Then open the command prompt (aka terminal) and run:\r\n\r\n`efibootmgr -v`\r\n\r\nI got a list showing the partitions that could boot and thee order that they'd apparently do so in. One row for Windows and a couple for \"Ubuntu\". One of these rows was my main Linux Mint install. The other is \"grub\" which is the menu system that lets you choose which OS to start when you turn your computer. Windows kept insisting on enabling itself and acting like it was first on the list no matter what I did whereas I needed the grub one to take precedence. The intuitive thing of \"change the boot order to the order you want it to be in\" did not help.\r\n\r\nSo I noted down the filenames each of these entries were associated withl- the parts starting:\r\n`/File(\\EFI\\....`\r\n\r\nThe Windows one in my case was the file:\r\n`\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi`\r\n\r\nThe \"grub\" one was:\r\n`\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi`\r\n\r\nThe Linux Mint one was:\r\n`\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi`\r\n\r\nThen, shutdown Linux, turn your computer off. \r\n\r\nReboot this time loading Windows (which is probably what will happen anyway given the issue we're trying to solve here).\r\n\r\nOpen the Windows command prompt in administrator mode (which means to hold Shift and right click it and choose \"Run as administrator\" rather than simply double-clicking it) and type this mystical incantation into it:\r\n\r\n`bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi`\r\n\r\nPresumably if you saw something other than \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi when you ran `efibootmgr` in the previous step then you should put what you saw relating to grub at the end of the `bcdedit` command rather than copying me exactly.\r\n\r\nThat said it completed successfully.

Somehow this gets him into a parcel-delivery mission down a non-existent highway, accompanied at times by a unusual genital-free man who grants peoples' wishes for better or worse - shades of a much more relaxed and horror-free [Wishmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishmaster_(film)) - via smoking a weird monkey-shaped pipe. Guided by an extremely prescient Magic 8-ball and visions of a lady only he can see, he sets out to delivery his parcel and of course along the way make those all-important life decisions. \n\nWhilst this might imply existential wrangling, it's pretty much light-hearted fun and games in this case.

When Sunak <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/24/another-day-another.html\">took over the British premiership</a> from the last Conservative mess of a Prime Minister, someone who must have set some kind of record for their damage-to-tenure ratio, I did have a little hope that he would at least try and be the &ldquo;sensible adult in the room&rdquo; that was promised. No hope at all that he&rsquo;d come up with thoughtful or progressive policies, but maybe at least he&rsquo;d manage to be some kind of boring technocrat before losing the next general election.</p>\n<p>I guess I was wrong. It seems like he wants the next election to be fought over the issue of which party can promise to damage the environment the most, with a side-helping of who can make the roads as dangerous as possible for us, their valued citizens. My fear is Labour will actually sign up to that battle, throwing away the last remnants of <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html\">the only policies of theirs I positively liked</a> to the wind. &ldquo;The wind&rdquo; of course being the next devastating hurricane the ongoing climate catastrophe <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1128221\">summons up</a>.</p>\n<p>A few days ago he was promoting his slightly 2017-robot-disguised-as-human visage via a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1685582472262602752\">photo of him</a> supposedly sitting in Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s old car.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Inevitably this turned out to be another lie, albeit probably an accidental one, insomuch as the car he was sitting in <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gaffe-prone-rishi-sunak-mocked-30591650\">was not in fact Thatcher&rsquo;s vehicle</a>, but rather one that her protection squad used.</p>\n<p>Sunak of course has form for pretending he&rsquo;s in other people&rsquo;s cars for PR reasons, namely the famous incident him filling up his Kia with post-tax-cut petrol that in fact <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/rishi-sunak-used-sainsburys-employees-car-for-petrol-filling-photo-op_uk_623c7038e4b019fd8138588f\">wasn&rsquo;t his Kia</a>.  At least it shows he has wherewithal to feel some tension between showing off his own extremely expensive fleet of cars and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-helicopter-travel-ulez-b2384489.html\">unnecessary helicopters</a> and appearing as, same as they all want to pretend to be, yawn, &ldquo;a man of the people&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Anyway, why was he polluting the media-waves pretending to be in Thatcher&rsquo;s car? Well a part of it was no doubt the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pm-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tory-party-chasing-the-ghost-of-margaret-thatcher/\">weird obsession</a> many of the wannabe Conservative movers-and-shakers and their acolytes have with their former Prime Minister who it must be said did actually manage to get things done. The wrong things, sure, but <em>things</em>.  Things with even more impact than the best of today&rsquo;s cabinet sponsored warm-take cringe-tweet.</p>\n<p>But also following the only Conservative hold in the recent &ldquo;Day Of 3-Byelections&rdquo;, the <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-suffers-by-election-bruising-but-avoids-clean-sweep-of-defeats-12924593\">Uxbridge result</a> where they managed to lose only around 93% of their previous majority, it&rsquo;s been decided by all and sundry that the reason they won was because they campaigned against the &ldquo;ULEZ&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Despite it&rsquo;s name, the ULEZ is not a species of war-mongering aliens, but rather the <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone\">Ultra Low Emission Zone</a>. It&rsquo;s a London based policy whereby if you have a vehicle that emits above <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone\">a certain threshold</a> of polluting emissions then you have to pay £12.50 a day to drive it within the specified zone.  The zone now includes Uxbridge after the (Labour) Mayor of London extended its scope. So this was admittedly potentially going to get pretty expensive for folk who have cause to regularly drive. Labour seems to agree, with their leader, Kier Starmer, deciding he&rsquo;s also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/starmer-urges-khan-to-reflect-on-ulez-rules-after-uxbridge-defeat\">against it</a>.</p>\n<p>It seems a reasonable criticism that making people with with non-compliant cars pay probably biases the charges towards older cars, which in turn means that the average owner might likely be poorer than someone with a newer, compliant, car (but much richer than someone with no car, plus not all new cars are compliant). Whether the charge will be tilted towards folk with a lesser ability to afford to pay it or not is a factual matter. I&rsquo;m sure someone has looked into it. And if it is, and it&rsquo;s seen as unfair, then sure, let&rsquo;s dream up a new policy that actually gets at what we really want to do here - which is to protect the environment, rather than let people pay to damage the environment.</p>\n<p>But somehow the issue of a certain constituency saying they don&rsquo;t like a very specific fairly punitive-at-the-individual-level scheme has developed into the idea that all pro-environmental policies are evil. Hence the Sunak tweet, sitting in his fake car, &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; (cringe) blasting out how he&rsquo;s the true motorist&rsquo;s friend.</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just bad tweets.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s ordered <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66351785\">a review</a> of all current low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs). Despite the fact in reality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular\">they&rsquo;re quite popular</a>, even if Conservative MP Nick Fletcher does believe them to be an &ldquo;international socialist concept&rdquo;, whatever that means.</p>\n<p>Further complicating matters is that no-one knows what LTN even means. Depending on the definition taken, there may be more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/16/critics-of-uk-low-traffic-schemes-told-that-25000-filters-already-existed\">25,000</a> of them. Their main use is to stop a torrent of traffic ripping its way through narrow residential streets. Pedestrians and cyclists can pass freely, and cars can still access the streets in order reach any destination within the area - but they&rsquo;re generally blocked in a way that stops you motoring your way right through a city entirely on the small, easily clogged, heavily pedestrian oriented streets where children play and suchlike.</p>\n<p>In a further bid to lionise the act of speeding tons of metal through inappropriate routes, ministers are also apparently thinking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-councils-20mph-speed-limit-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns\">restrict councils' freedom</a> to create 20 miles per hour speed limits. The <a href=\"https://www.roadpeace.org/\">RoadPeace charity</a> is amongst many other interested parties who express sentiments along the lines of being &ldquo;extremely disappointed to see roads made demonstrably less safe.”</p>\n<p>Central government imposing these restrictions on council decisions - I guess Sunak stopped &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; right after he left the photo-op - might not actually be be legal under current legislation. They might have to change the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/contents\">1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act</a> to go ahead with this.</p>\n<p>These things are also important for reasons outside of environmental emissions, and in fact aren&rsquo;t necessarily even targeted at improving our atmosphere in that way. As Devi Sridhar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/uk-must-follow-europe-lead-prioritising-walking-cycling-public-transport\">recently summarised</a>, this stuff is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;not about banning cars, but about making it cheaper and simpler to replace short-distance single occupancy journeys with alternatives that have far-reaching benefits for the city’s inhabitants and the planet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those benefits include staying alive. The ultimate freedom, if we must. It was a campaign group whose name translates to &ldquo;Stop The Child Murder&rdquo; that helped compel the Dutch government to make their cities less car focussed. Over 400 children died in traffic accidents over there in 1971. Now it&rsquo;s more like 17 per year.</p>\n<p>Over here in the UK, last year <a href=\"https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/slowing-city-traffic-cuts-road-deaths-by-a-quarter-study-shows/31621\">a study</a> found that reducing the speed limit in the city of Edinburgh to 20 mph - the very thing that the government is rumoured to oppose - reduced road deaths by 23%, serious injuries by 33% and collisions by 40%. &ldquo;Livability&rdquo;, things such as safety, health, sustainability and living standards also improved, as did the number of people who supported and were willing to obey the new limits.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://discerningcyclist.com/which-city-has-the-most-cyclists-statistics/\">majority of Dutch people</a> are cyclists now, making them the one of the most physically active populations around according to <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/dutch-are-most-physically-active-nation-brazilians-are-least#:~:text=A%20new%20global%20Ipsos%20study,of%206.1%20across%2029%20markets.\">an Ipsos poll</a> , with all the concomitant health and life-extending benefits that brings. People seem to embrace pro-cycling infrastructure when it exists; increasing the number of cycle lanes in Paris led to a <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/increase-paris-cycle-lanes-leads-dramatic-rise-bike-commuting/\">54% increase in cycle usage</a>.</p>\n<p>And air pollution does more than cause our planet to burn up. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/doctors-urge-politicians-to-stand-firm-on-schemes-to-tackle-air-pollution\">group of doctors wrote</a> to the Labour leader and mayor of London begging them not to bow to the pressure to throw away the progress made so far with initiatives such as ULEZ because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Air pollution affects every one of us from before we are born into old age. It not only causes respiratory conditions such as asthma, but also heart attacks, heart arrhythmias, strokes, child developmental disorders, lung cancer and dementia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/air-pollution-linked-rise-antibiotic-resistance-imperils-human-health\">recent study</a> also suggests that air pollution may be exacerbating the rise of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance already kills 1.3 million people a year, and if it gets out of hand could in theory make a serious dent in global human population numbers. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.&rdquo; according to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance\">World Health Organisation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ULEZ scheme specifically seems to be helping on the air pollution front. London&rsquo;s air pollution <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-transformational-impact-expanded-ultra-low-emission-zone-so-far\">has dropped</a>. I haven&rsquo;t looked into how to quantify this directly in terms of health benefits. But 4,000 of London&rsquo;s deaths were apparently <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/213273/tackling-londons-pollution-will-increase-life/\">attributable to air pollution</a> in 2019 so there are some major wins potentially to be had.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://erg.ic.ac.uk/research/home/resources/ERG_ImperialCollegeLondon_HIA_AQ_LDN_11012021.pdf\">One study suggested</a> that if the mayor&rsquo;s air pollution policies were followed then Londoners would gain an extra 6.1 million life years by 2050. It would be even higher, 20% higher, if they managed to meet the World Health Organisation guidelines.</p>\n<p>The ULEZ scheme itself aims to <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/pollution-and-air-quality/ultra-low-emission-zone-ulez-london\">save over a million hospital admissions</a>, albeit this particular figure sounds like a somewhat vague aspiration that won&rsquo;t be realised until 2050 so possibly one should dig into the evidence around that before parroting it too much.</p>\n<p>The doctors raised another important point, and one that highlights that any &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; or economic harm caused to some people by ULEZ is down to policy choices, not its overall objective.</p>\n<p>The policy shouldn&rsquo;t stand alone. Rather there should be &ldquo;a commitment to a much more affordable, frequent and reliable public transport system&rdquo; as well. People do need to get to places. No sensible person should argue otherwise. But I can easily think of several other carrot-rather-than-stick approaches that might be added to the mix, rather than removing one of the few things that seems to be working for the sake of the Conservatives desperate attempt to introduce some US-imported-style culture war banter as a last ditch effort to not get totally laughed out of office next time we have a general election.</p>\n<p>Obviously the idea should be to put together a package of policies that improve the health of us and our planet whilst mitigating any downsides of any individual approach. Not just give up and throw them all in the landfill-destined bin because a few of those people not rendered too ill by air pollution to get to the polling station in a couple of years time might vote for you.</p>\n<p>The insanity is not limited to the motorist love-ins unfortunately. Last week Sunak announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023\">a vast expansion</a> of North Sea oil and gas drilling. Living as we do in a post-truth world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis\">he claims</a> that this is &ldquo;entirely consistent with our plan to get to net zero&rdquo;. He actually seems to think that it&rsquo;s positively pro-environment. More on this in a bit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis\">Oxfam&rsquo;s climate advisor disagrees</a> and highlights that should we want to generate more energy more locally at less environmental cost - all good objectives when the current option often seems to lead to paying war criminals big bucks to import it let alone the environmental concerns - there is an obvious alternative:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low-carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s proposing nationalising the process, or really doing anything other than let whichever company does the extraction run riot on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; market as far as I can see.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis\">Per Mike Childs</a> from Friends of the Earth:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences will simply pour more fuel on the flames, while doing nothing for energy security as these fossil fuels will be sold on international markets and not reserved for UK use</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similar comments abound. Kate White from the WWF is <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-heads-to-scotland-for-net-zero-energy-policy-push-12930459\">quoted by Sky News</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot; [Sunak&rsquo;s plan will] do nothing to cut household energy bills or shore up our energy security - it will simply line the pockets of the extractive industry while the world burns&hellip;the solution to the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis is in affordable, clean energy; better insulation for our homes; and restoring our natural world.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carbon Brief <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-why-banning-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-is-not-a-just-stop-oil-plan/\">looked into</a> some of the energy security related claims. Unsurprisingly they don&rsquo;t stack up.</p>\n<p>Apparently on average it takes 28 years after the granting of oil and gas licenses for the flow of fossil fuels to start. If it&rsquo;s anything like as long as that then these fuels won&rsquo;t come online until the 2040s. They do nothing to solve today&rsquo;s security or cost of living crisis. And by 2040 we should be well on our way towards net zero, with the plan (supposedly supported by Sunak) being to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050. If we need a new flow of fossil fuel at that point then something went very wrong.</p>\n<p>There are so many other ways the government could improve the cost of living situation for UK citizens that don&rsquo;t involve waiting a quarter of a century and hoping big businesses show unprecedented compassion.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no reason to suspect the fossil fuel companies would by remotely shy about maximising their profits from any new gas and oil that they could possibly get their hands on. In these cost-of-living-whilst-the-world-burns crisis times Shell recently reported its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/shell-makes-record-quarterly-profits-of-nearly-10bn\">largest ever first quarter profits</a>: $9.6 billion for the first quarter of this year. BP made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/bp-profits-energy-windfall-tax-oil-gas\">$5 billion profit</a> during the same period.</p>\n<p>Sunak et al also seem to have gotten this odd idea that &ldquo;buying local&rdquo; is incredibly environmentally beneficial when it comes to fossil fuels, claiming that importing fuel from elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12355601/Rishi-Sunak-Just-Stop-Oil-Labour-North-Sea-oil-gas.html\">ends up releasing 3-4x</a> as many carbon emissions.</p>\n<p>At first this made me wonder if Sunak thinks that we import oil by putting it into small bottles and hand delivering it via single-passenger private jets or something. Once I got over myself, I actually looked into what the reality is and wrote about it in more detail <a href=\"https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2023/08/10/is-british-gas-and-oil-really-4x-as-good-for-the-environment-as-imported-fuel/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The TLDR would be that the &ldquo;3-4x the emissions&rdquo; claim for imported alternatives to North Sea gas and oil is not exactly an outright fiction but it&rsquo;s very misleading. It appears to refer to only the emissions associated with the <em>transport</em> of fuel, only for gas, and only for the minority of gas that is transported to the UK in liquid form.</p>\n<p>The process of shipping gas via boat involves converting it to liquid form (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas\">Liquified Natural Gas</a>, or &ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) before putting it on a boat and then converting it back when it arrives. That is an energy intensive process, quite possibly <a href=\"https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/\">generating 3-4x the emissions</a> associated with (just) the <em>transporting</em> of <em>gas</em> via methods not involving LNG, such as via a pipeline.</p>\n<p>However, it turns out that only a minority of Britain&rsquo;s imported gas is transported via LNG. <a href=\"https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/\">Most of it</a> comes through a pipeline and hence does not incur anything like that process' emissions penalty.</p>\n<p>In any case, the emissions generated by even the nasty LNG gas process are <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/sunak-claims-north-sea-gas-four-times-less-polluting-than-imports\">only a small fraction</a> of the total emissions generated during the lifecycle of the gas overall. The large majority of emissions come from the actual use of the fuel itself. There is no possible way to reduce the actual emissions associated with that gas by anything like as much as 3-4x by fiddling around with the extraction or transport process when most of the emissions are associated with the end use of the gas itself.</p>\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, oil isn&rsquo;t affected by the LNG process so I couldn&rsquo;t find any similar-in-scale emissions savings to be had there.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also of note that some countries <a href=\"https://www.petro-online.com/news/fuel-for-thought/13/sp-global/two-thirds-of-uk-and-norway-north-sea-oil-and-gas-production-has-lower-than-average-greenhouse-gas-intensity-new-analysis-finds/59378#:~:text=The%20analysis%20found%20that%2C%20on,(8%20kgCO2e%2Fboe).\">are substantially better than the UK</a> at extracting gas and oil in terms of having reduced emissions for the extraction process itself. The trend there will also be <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Letter-to-Kwasi-Kwarteng-Climate-Compatibility-of-New-Oil-and-Gas-Fields.pdf\">that they improve further</a> if they enact the process improvements that they&rsquo;ve already committed to. But this is still not the biggest deal: remember that the majority of the emissions associated with gas come from the usage of the gas itself.</p>\n<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, switching to basically any form of renewable energy would vastly outweigh even the very best case emissions savings one could get from the North Sea network. Vastly. Yes, <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html\">even when you take into account the end-to-end impact</a> of manufacturing, maintaining and disposing of the equipment needed to use renewables.</p>\n<p>Other assumptions that one would have to make in order to see even the small North Sea emissions benefit prospectively on offer include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That the North Sea gas is all kept and used in the UK rather than being exported elsewhere. As mentioned above, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that that will happen.</li>\n<li>That any extra gas and oil extracted from the North Sea means that there will be a similar reduction in the amount extracted (and in part exported via LNG) globally. I see no reason to think that that will be true. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve reached a level where the demand for energy is entirely satiated. Instead, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the oil and gas market will simply enlarge. And if more gas and oil is sold then - especially as most of the associated emissions come from the use of the fuels - proportionally more pollution will be generated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So for all Sunak&rsquo;s hobby of &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; he seems to be chatting about only very specific types of freedom.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a type of freedom that values the freedom to create traffic jams on unsuitably small residential roads over the freedom to not become ill from other people&rsquo;s air pollution infusing your home. The freedom to legally drive 10 miles per hour faster than you used to be able to, over the freedom to not be involved in a fatal accident. The freedom for a few to greatly profit from the harmful exploitation of natural resources over the freedom for us all to live in a planet with a bearable climate.  You can&rsquo;t enjoy exceeding the 20 mph limit all that much if you are too ill or too dead to drive.</p>\n<p>The people who tend to be most <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-hurts-poorest-most\">vulnerable to pollution</a> or the immediate <a href=\"https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/climate-change/how-climate-change-impacts-poverty\">ravages of climate change</a> are of course on average poorer, more disadvantaged, and hold less economic and political power than the average person, let alone the CEO of whichever big oil company and the owners of very fast cars. In this way, <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html\">Frank Wilhoit&rsquo;s evergreen canard</a> that conservatives naturally tend towards the idea that laws exist to protect in-groups by binding out-groups shows its face once again.</p>\n",

My fear is Labour will actually sign up to that battle, throwing away the last remnants of [the only policies of theirs I positively liked](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html) to the wind. \"The wind\" of course being the next devastating hurricane the ongoing climate catastrophe [summons up](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1128221).\r\n\r\nA few days ago he was promoting his slightly 2017-robot-disguised-as-human visage via a [photo of him](https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1685582472262602752) supposedly sitting in Margaret Thatcher's old car.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/sunaktw.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"694\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nInevitably this turned out to be another lie, albeit probably an accidental one, insomuch as the car he was sitting in [was not in fact Thatcher's vehicle](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gaffe-prone-rishi-sunak-mocked-30591650), but rather one that her protection squad used.\r\n\r\nSunak of course has form for pretending he's in other people's cars for PR reasons, namely the famous incident him filling up his Kia with post-tax-cut petrol that in fact [wasn't his Kia](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/rishi-sunak-used-sainsburys-employees-car-for-petrol-filling-photo-op_uk_623c7038e4b019fd8138588f).  At least it shows he has wherewithal to feel some tension between showing off his own extremely expensive fleet of cars and [unnecessary helicopters](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-helicopter-travel-ulez-b2384489.html) and appearing as, same as they all want to pretend to be, yawn, \"a man of the people\".  \r\n\r\nAnyway, why was he polluting the media-waves pretending to be in Thatcher's car? Well a part of it was no doubt the [weird obsession](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pm-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tory-party-chasing-the-ghost-of-margaret-thatcher/) many of the wannabe Conservative movers-and-shakers and their acolytes have with their former Prime Minister who it must be said did actually manage to get things done. The wrong things, sure, but *things*.  Things with even more impact than the best of today's cabinet sponsored warm-take cringe-tweet. \r\n\r\nBut also following the only Conservative hold in the recent \"Day Of 3-Byelections\", the [Uxbridge result](https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-suffers-by-election-bruising-but-avoids-clean-sweep-of-defeats-12924593) where they managed to lose only around 93% of their previous majority, it's been decided by all and sundry that the reason they won was because they campaigned against the \"ULEZ\". \r\n\r\nDespite it's name, the ULEZ is not a species of war-mongering aliens, but rather the [Ultra Low Emission Zone](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone). It's a London based policy whereby if you have a vehicle that emits above [a certain threshold](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone) of polluting emissions then you have to pay £12.50 a day to drive it within the specified zone.  The zone now includes Uxbridge after the (Labour) Mayor of London extended its scope. So this was admittedly potentially going to get pretty expensive for folk who have cause to regularly drive. Labour seems to agree, with their leader, Kier Starmer, deciding he's also [against it](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/starmer-urges-khan-to-reflect-on-ulez-rules-after-uxbridge-defeat). \r\n\r\nIt seems a reasonable criticism that making people with with non-compliant cars pay probably biases the charges towards older cars, which in turn means that the average owner might likely be poorer than someone with a newer, compliant, car (but much richer than someone with no car, plus not all new cars are compliant). Whether the charge will be tilted towards folk with a lesser ability to afford to pay it or not is a factual matter. I'm sure someone has looked into it. And if it is, and it's seen as unfair, then sure, let's dream up a new policy that actually gets at what we really want to do here - which is to protect the environment, rather than let people pay to damage the environment.\r\n\r\nBut somehow the issue of a certain constituency saying they don't like a very specific fairly punitive-at-the-individual-level scheme has developed into the idea that all pro-environmental policies are evil. Hence the Sunak tweet, sitting in his fake car, \"talking about freedom\" (cringe) blasting out how he's the true motorist's friend.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just bad tweets.\r\n\r\nHe's ordered [a review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66351785) of all current low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs). Despite the fact in reality [they're quite popular](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular), even if Conservative MP Nick Fletcher does believe them to be an \"international socialist concept\", whatever that means. \r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters is that no-one knows what LTN even means. Depending on the definition taken, there may be more than [25,000](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/16/critics-of-uk-low-traffic-schemes-told-that-25000-filters-already-existed) of them. Their main use is to stop a torrent of traffic ripping its way through narrow residential streets. Pedestrians and cyclists can pass freely, and cars can still access the streets in order reach any destination within the area - but they're generally blocked in a way that stops you motoring your way right through a city entirely on the small, easily clogged, heavily pedestrian oriented streets where children play and suchlike.\r\n\r\nIn a further bid to lionise the act of speeding tons of metal through inappropriate routes, ministers are also apparently thinking to [restrict councils' freedom](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-councils-20mph-speed-limit-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns) to create 20 miles per hour speed limits. The [RoadPeace charity](https://www.roadpeace.org/) is amongst many other interested parties who express sentiments along the lines of being \"extremely disappointed to see roads made demonstrably less safe.”\r\n\r\nCentral government imposing these restrictions on council decisions - I guess Sunak stopped \"talking about freedom\" right after he left the photo-op - might not actually be be legal under current legislation. They might have to change the [1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/contents) to go ahead with this.\r\n\r\nThese things are also important for reasons outside of environmental emissions, and in fact aren't necessarily even targeted at improving our atmosphere in that way. As Devi Sridhar [recently summarised](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/uk-must-follow-europe-lead-prioritising-walking-cycling-public-transport), this stuff is:\r\n\r\n>...not about banning cars, but about making it cheaper and simpler to replace short-distance single occupancy journeys with alternatives that have far-reaching benefits for the city’s inhabitants and the planet.\r\n\r\nThose benefits include staying alive. The ultimate freedom, if we must. It was a campaign group whose name translates to \"Stop The Child Murder\" that helped compel the Dutch government to make their cities less car focussed. Over 400 children died in traffic accidents over there in 1971. Now it's more like 17 per year.\r\n\r\nOver here in the UK, last year [a study](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/slowing-city-traffic-cuts-road-deaths-by-a-quarter-study-shows/31621) found that reducing the speed limit in the city of Edinburgh to 20 mph - the very thing that the government is rumoured to oppose - reduced road deaths by 23%, serious injuries by 33% and collisions by 40%. \"Livability\", things such as safety, health, sustainability and living standards also improved, as did the number of people who supported and were willing to obey the new limits.\r\n\r\nThe [majority of Dutch people](https://discerningcyclist.com/which-city-has-the-most-cyclists-statistics/) are cyclists now, making them the one of the most physically active populations around according to [an Ipsos poll](https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/dutch-are-most-physically-active-nation-brazilians-are-least#:~:text=A%20new%20global%20Ipsos%20study,of%206.1%20across%2029%20markets.) , with all the concomitant health and life-extending benefits that brings. People seem to embrace pro-cycling infrastructure when it exists; increasing the number of cycle lanes in Paris led to a [54% increase in cycle usage](https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/increase-paris-cycle-lanes-leads-dramatic-rise-bike-commuting/).\r\n\r\nAnd air pollution does more than cause our planet to burn up. A [group of doctors wrote](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/doctors-urge-politicians-to-stand-firm-on-schemes-to-tackle-air-pollution) to the Labour leader and mayor of London begging them not to bow to the pressure to throw away the progress made so far with initiatives such as ULEZ because:\r\n\r\n>Air pollution affects every one of us from before we are born into old age. It not only causes respiratory conditions such as asthma, but also heart attacks, heart arrhythmias, strokes, child developmental disorders, lung cancer and dementia.\r\n\r\nA [recent study](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/air-pollution-linked-rise-antibiotic-resistance-imperils-human-health) also suggests that air pollution may be exacerbating the rise of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance already kills 1.3 million people a year, and if it gets out of hand could in theory make a serious dent in global human population numbers. It's \"one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.\" according to the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance):\r\n\r\n>...we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.\r\n\r\nThe ULEZ scheme specifically seems to be helping on the air pollution front. London's air pollution [has dropped](https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-transformational-impact-expanded-ultra-low-emission-zone-so-far). I haven't looked into how to quantify this directly in terms of health benefits. But 4,000 of London's deaths were apparently [attributable to air pollution](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/213273/tackling-londons-pollution-will-increase-life/) in 2019 so there are some major wins potentially to be had. \r\n\r\n[One study suggested](http://erg.ic.ac.uk/research/home/resources/ERG_ImperialCollegeLondon_HIA_AQ_LDN_11012021.pdf) that if the mayor's air pollution policies were followed then Londoners would gain an extra 6.1 million life years by 2050. It would be even higher, 20% higher, if they managed to meet the World Health Organisation guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe ULEZ scheme itself aims to [save over a million hospital admissions](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/pollution-and-air-quality/ultra-low-emission-zone-ulez-london), albeit this particular figure sounds like a somewhat vague aspiration that won't be realised until 2050 so possibly one should dig into the evidence around that before parroting it too much.\r\n\r\nThe doctors raised another important point, and one that highlights that any \"unfairness\" or economic harm caused to some people by ULEZ is down to policy choices, not its overall objective.\r\n\r\nThe policy shouldn't stand alone. Rather there should be \"a commitment to a much more affordable, frequent and reliable public transport system\" as well. People do need to get to places. No sensible person should argue otherwise. But I can easily think of several other carrot-rather-than-stick approaches that might be added to the mix, rather than removing one of the few things that seems to be working for the sake of the Conservatives desperate attempt to introduce some US-imported-style culture war banter as a last ditch effort to not get totally laughed out of office next time we have a general election.\r\n\r\nObviously the idea should be to put together a package of policies that improve the health of us and our planet whilst mitigating any downsides of any individual approach. Not just give up and throw them all in the landfill-destined bin because a few of those people not rendered too ill by air pollution to get to the polling station in a couple of years time might vote for you.\r\n\r\nThe insanity is not limited to the motorist love-ins unfortunately. Last week Sunak announced [a vast expansion](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023) of North Sea oil and gas drilling. Living as we do in a post-truth world, [he claims](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis) that this is \"entirely consistent with our plan to get to net zero\". He actually seems to think that it's positively pro-environment. More on this in a bit.\r\n\r\n[Oxfam's climate advisor disagrees](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis) and highlights that should we want to generate more energy more locally at less environmental cost - all good objectives when the current option often seems to lead to paying war criminals big bucks to import it let alone the environmental concerns - there is an obvious alternative:\r\n\r\n>Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low-carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.\r\n\r\nIt's not like he's proposing nationalising the process, or really doing anything other than let whichever company does the extraction run riot on the \"free\" market as far as I can see.\r\n\r\n[Per Mike Childs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis) from Friends of the Earth:\r\n\r\n>Granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences will simply pour more fuel on the flames, while doing nothing for energy security as these fossil fuels will be sold on international markets and not reserved for UK use\r\n\r\nSimilar comments abound. Kate White from the WWF is [quoted by Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-heads-to-scotland-for-net-zero-energy-policy-push-12930459)\r\n\r\n>\" [Sunak's plan will] do nothing to cut household energy bills or shore up our energy security - it will simply line the pockets of the extractive industry while the world burns...the solution to the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis is in affordable, clean energy; better insulation for our homes; and restoring our natural world.\"\r\n\r\nCarbon Brief [looked into](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-why-banning-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-is-not-a-just-stop-oil-plan/) some of the energy security related claims. Unsurprisingly they don't stack up. \r\n\r\nApparently on average it takes 28 years after the granting of oil and gas licenses for the flow of fossil fuels to start. If it's anything like as long as that then these fuels won't come online until the 2040s. They do nothing to solve today's security or cost of living crisis. And by 2040 we should be well on our way towards net zero, with the plan (supposedly supported by Sunak) being to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050. If we need a new flow of fossil fuel at that point then something went very wrong. \r\n\r\nThere are so many other ways the government could improve the cost of living situation for UK citizens that don't involve waiting a quarter of a century and hoping big businesses show unprecedented compassion.\r\n\r\nThere's certainly no reason to suspect the fossil fuel companies would by remotely shy about maximising their profits from any new gas and oil that they could possibly get their hands on. In these cost-of-living-whilst-the-world-burns crisis times Shell recently reported its [largest ever first quarter profits](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/shell-makes-record-quarterly-profits-of-nearly-10bn): $9.6 billion for the first quarter of this year. BP made [$5 billion profit](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/bp-profits-energy-windfall-tax-oil-gas) during the same period.\r\n\r\nSunak et al also seem to have gotten this odd idea that \"buying local\" is incredibly environmentally beneficial when it comes to fossil fuels, claiming that importing fuel from elsewhere [ends up releasing 3-4x](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12355601/Rishi-Sunak-Just-Stop-Oil-Labour-North-Sea-oil-gas.html) as many carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nAt first this made me wonder if Sunak thinks that we import oil by putting it into small bottles and hand delivering it via single-passenger private jets or something. Once I got over myself, I actually looked into what the reality is and wrote about it in more detail [here](https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2023/08/10/is-british-gas-and-oil-really-4x-as-good-for-the-environment-as-imported-fuel/). \r\n\r\nThe TLDR would be that the \"3-4x the emissions\" claim for imported alternatives to North Sea gas and oil is not exactly an outright fiction but it's very misleading. It appears to refer to only the emissions associated with the *transport* of fuel, only for gas, and only for the minority of gas that is transported to the UK in liquid form. \r\n\r\nThe process of shipping gas via boat involves converting it to liquid form ([Liquified Natural Gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas), or \"LNG\") before putting it on a boat and then converting it back when it arrives. That is an energy intensive process, quite possibly [generating 3-4x the emissions](https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/) associated with (just) the *transporting* of *gas* via methods not involving LNG, such as via a pipeline.\r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that only a minority of Britain's imported gas is transported via LNG. [Most of it](https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/) comes through a pipeline and hence does not incur anything like that process' emissions penalty.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the emissions generated by even the nasty LNG gas process are [only a small fraction](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/sunak-claims-north-sea-gas-four-times-less-polluting-than-imports) of the total emissions generated during the lifecycle of the gas overall. The large majority of emissions come from the actual use of the fuel itself. There is no possible way to reduce the actual emissions associated with that gas by anything like as much as 3-4x by fiddling around with the extraction or transport process when most of the emissions are associated with the end use of the gas itself.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, oil isn't affected by the LNG process so I couldn't find any similar-in-scale emissions savings to be had there. \r\n\r\nIt's also of note that some countries [are substantially better than the UK](https://www.petro-online.com/news/fuel-for-thought/13/sp-global/two-thirds-of-uk-and-norway-north-sea-oil-and-gas-production-has-lower-than-average-greenhouse-gas-intensity-new-analysis-finds/59378#:~:text=The%20analysis%20found%20that%2C%20on,(8%20kgCO2e%2Fboe).) at extracting gas and oil in terms of having reduced emissions for the extraction process itself. The trend there will also be [that they improve further](https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Letter-to-Kwasi-Kwarteng-Climate-Compatibility-of-New-Oil-and-Gas-Fields.pdf) if they enact the process improvements that they've already committed to. But this is still not the biggest deal: remember that the majority of the emissions associated with gas come from the usage of the gas itself.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, switching to basically any form of renewable energy would vastly outweigh even the very best case emissions savings one could get from the North Sea network. Vastly. Yes, [even when you take into account the end-to-end impact](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html) of manufacturing, maintaining and disposing of the equipment needed to use renewables. \r\n\r\nOther assumptions that one would have to make in order to see even the small North Sea emissions benefit prospectively on offer include:\r\n\r\n1) That the North Sea gas is all kept and used in the UK rather than being exported elsewhere. As mentioned above, there's no reason to believe that that will happen. \r\n2) That any extra gas and oil extracted from the North Sea means that there will be a similar reduction in the amount extracted (and in part exported via LNG) globally. I see no reason to think that that will be true. It's not like we've reached a level where the demand for energy is entirely satiated. Instead, there's a good chance that the oil and gas market will simply enlarge. And if more gas and oil is sold then - especially as most of the associated emissions come from the use of the fuels - proportionally more pollution will be generated.\r\n\r\nSo for all Sunak's hobby of \"talking about freedom\" he seems to be chatting about only very specific types of freedom. \r\n\r\nIt's a type of freedom that values the freedom to create traffic jams on unsuitably small residential roads over the freedom to not become ill from other people's air pollution infusing your home. The freedom to legally drive 10 miles per hour faster than you used to be able to, over the freedom to not be involved in a fatal accident. The freedom for a few to greatly profit from the harmful exploitation of natural resources over the freedom for us all to live in a planet with a bearable climate.  You can't enjoy exceeding the 20 mph limit all that much if you are too ill or too dead to drive. \r\n\r\nThe people who tend to be most [vulnerable to pollution](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-hurts-poorest-most) or the immediate [ravages of climate change](https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/climate-change/how-climate-change-impacts-poverty) are of course on average poorer, more disadvantaged, and hold less economic and political power than the average person, let alone the CEO of whichever big oil company and the owners of very fast cars. In this way, [Frank Wilhoit's evergreen canard](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html) that conservatives naturally tend towards the idea that laws exist to protect in-groups by binding out-groups shows its face once again.\n",

A true simulation of the American Dream, accessible to all, realised like never before.</p>\n<p>Except, inevitably, that story isn&rsquo;t true.

Well, as luck would have it, Al has discovered a strange portal in a corner of a diner. Walking through it leaves you in the same geographic location in the year 1958.</p>\n<p>You can return back to modernity as and when you want. And no matter how long you spent in the past-times world, it&rsquo;s only 2 minutes later when you come back to 2011. But it might be a totally different 2011 if you did something in the past that had substantial repercussions.</p>\n<p>We know that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy\">Kennedy was shot in 1963</a>. So Jake has a few years to get accustomed to discretely living in the past, to learn how the world used to work. Unfortunately for him, the past has a way of resisting changes to the original timeline. You might plan to do something that was never done in the 1960s only to be inexplicably diverted, distracted or incapacitated en-route. This tendency is not infallible, the past can change in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not entirely straightforward.</p>\n<p>A further complication is of course the mystery surrounding the JFK assassination. In our world there are plenty of people out there who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories\">do not believe</a> Oswald was the real assassin, or at least not the sole person involved. These people include the large majority of Americans in a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1813/most-americans-believe-oswald-conspired-others-kill-jfk.aspx\">2001 poll</a>.</p>\n<p>Would killing Oswald in cold blood <em>really</em> stop JFK being assassinated? Especially if not only is there a decent chance that he wasn&rsquo;t the sole operator involved, but also that tendency of the the past to exert mysterious forces in the direction of recreating its original timeline.</p>\n<p>Jake is not a natural murderer. Understandably he wants some certainty that there is some point to conducting this operation before committing such an alien act.</p>\n<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not the only unknown. Sure, Al believes JFK staying alive long would have dramatically improved the world. But would it really? Would there be no cost to pay at all? Few people would feel certain about that, and Jake is no stranger to doubt. So many time travel stories have conveyed to us the idea that altering the past could have intended consequences for the future.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, living in any community for several years means you&rsquo;ll struggle not to build up a lifestyle, habits and human relationships that might be hard to put aside for a small chance of possibly doing something that may or may not make the future a bit better. That&rsquo;s even if you could navigate your way through an alien world that resists your every attempt to change it so as to be in the right place at the right time to put a potentially huge dent into standard-timeline history.</p>\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;m pleased to say that a mere 800ish pages later you&rsquo;ll find out what Jake thought and did.  Yes, it is a mammoth tome, so long that had it not come with such a strong recommendation I doubt I&rsquo;d have considered starting it. But the recommendation was a good one.

You might plan to do something that was never done in the 1960s only to be inexplicably diverted, distracted or incapacitated en-route. This tendency is not infallible, the past can change in some ways, but it's not entirely straightforward.\r\n\r\nA further complication is of course the mystery surrounding the JFK assassination. In our world there are plenty of people out there who [do not believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories) Oswald was the real assassin, or at least not the sole person involved. These people include the large majority of Americans in a [2001 poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1813/most-americans-believe-oswald-conspired-others-kill-jfk.aspx). \r\n\r\nWould killing Oswald in cold blood *really* stop JFK being assassinated? Especially if not only is there a decent chance that he wasn't the sole operator involved, but also that tendency of the the past to exert mysterious forces in the direction of recreating its original timeline. \r\n\r\nJake is not a natural murderer. Understandably he wants some certainty that there is some point to conducting this operation before committing such an alien act.\r\n\r\nOf course that's not the only unknown. Sure, Al believes JFK staying alive long would have dramatically improved the world. But would it really? Would there be no cost to pay at all? Few people would feel certain about that, and Jake is no stranger to doubt. So many time travel stories have conveyed to us the idea that altering the past could have intended consequences for the future. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, living in any community for several years means you'll struggle not to build up a lifestyle, habits and human relationships that might be hard to put aside for a small chance of possibly doing something that may or may not make the future a bit better. That's even if you could navigate your way through an alien world that resists your every attempt to change it so as to be in the right place at the right time to put a potentially huge dent into standard-timeline history.  \r\n\r\nWell, I'm pleased to say that a mere 800ish pages later you'll find out what Jake thought and did.  Yes, it is a mammoth tome, so long that had it not come with such a strong recommendation I doubt I'd have considered starting it. But the recommendation was a good one. It was over long before I could ever have gotten bored of it.\n",

				"title": "Jenara Nerenberg asks us to consider a different type of diversity in \"Divergent Mind\"",
				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780062876812\">Divergent Mind</a> by Jenara Nerenberg.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This book encourages us to consider a type of diversity less commonly considered in mainstream <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion\">diversity, equity and inclusion</a> efforts: the differences in how people think and feel, with a focus on how they process sensory input.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Temperament rights&rdquo; captures the idea that we should respect individual&rsquo;s temperament and neurology in the same way that we should respect other aspects of people such as their gender, sexuality, or ethnic identity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Much of the focus is on people with high sensitivity. This is commonly an aspect of diagnoses like autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, synesthesia or those termed  &ldquo;highly sensitive people&rdquo;, as well as present in plenty of people who have no medical diagnosis at all.</p>\n<p>Living in a world not attuned for ones' sensory processing can be overwhelming, exhausting and frustrating. Things that seem perfectly normal to other people - loud music, crowds - can be very stressful. &ldquo;Everyday&rdquo; tasks we&rsquo;re all supposed to be able to do such as housework or adhering to deadlines might be difficult. At the same time they might truly excel in other areas of life.</p>\n<p>The difficulties are compounded by the pressure those with these conditions feel to fit in, to appear &ldquo;normal&rdquo; throughout life. They do this by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_(personality)\">masking</a> their experience. They may feel compelled to do this in every aspect of life, including in social and workplace environments, silently facing an extra challenge many of us do not. Women are apparently particularly prone to this, with their behaviour in general being more policed within our patriarchal society, having been socialised to mask more often and more effectively.</p>\n<p>Of course this comes at a cost. Sufferers may appear to lash out or exhibit other behaviours determined by many to be &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. They commonly present with comorbidities such as depression anxiety, shame, guilt, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and distorted self-image. Masking by definition precludes you from living a life in accordance with your true self.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that the person concerned themselves doesn&rsquo;t realise what&rsquo;s causing their challenge. They might seek treatment just for the more visible symptoms of their condition rather than what underlies it, or another condition entirely, which is generally ineffective.</p>\n<p>One criticism I&rsquo;ve seen of the book is that it heavily focuses on a particular demographic of folk with neurodivergences - most obviously women, and in particular middle class women. There&rsquo;s not a ton of discussion about the effects of poverty, race, sexuality or other intersections of identity. I can see aspects in this in terms of the suggestions of how to live a life more compatible with one&rsquo;s sensitivities that are provided at times. Moving to a quieter neighborhood, redecorating your house, reading the latest research on neurodivergence or getting a new job more suited to your cognitive style are not exactly opportunities easily open to all.</p>\n<p>Of course if you fit into this sort of demographic or know people who do, this might be a benefit rather than drawback when it comes to getting insight into yourself or others, And to be fair, many of the suggestions are more widely applicable.</p>\n<p>The critical message of the importance of learning to accept yourself as you are and then working to accept others as they are is clearly a message that can benefit us all. If this book helps people that struggle through life for one reason or another understand they&rsquo;re not alone and certainly not broken or deficient then it&rsquo;ll obviously be a force for good.</p>\n<p>On the gender front, a man with such a condition might be a little surprised at its female focus given the title doesn&rsquo;t make that so clear. But I guess it acts as a counterbalance against the dominance of maleness in past psychological and medical research, a topic the book goes into some detail about when it reviews the history of psychology as a discipline. Given some of these conditions may present differently in women than men one might need to read another book on top of this one for a full understanding.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a inevitable tension here between the idea of celebrating neurodiversity versus the pathologisation of it. Under the former mindset, no-one&rsquo;s thinking or sensory style is right or wrong. There&rsquo;s tremendous amount of variation such that the concept of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is itself largely flawed. Whether a mental tendency makes your life harder or easier is often really a product of societal and environmental choices rather than something inherent to the condition - consider the &ldquo;social model&rdquo; of disability.   Even what we regard as a disorder certainly has changed and will again change dramatically over time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The DSM is more like a catalogue of current social ailments than scientific hardwired “diseases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand people do often end up as being labelled as having a  disorder. Some who suffer may seek this out. This risks marking them as &ldquo;aberrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;weird&rdquo; or &ldquo;sick&rdquo;. Expectations may be lowered, judgements may be received. But such a label unfortunately is often necessary to gain access to healthcare or support systems.</p>\n<p>Although there can be upsides in carefully-used labels. Many people feel far better once they&rsquo;ve found a label that seems to describe how they exist in the world, that what they experience is both &ldquo;real&rdquo; and acknowledged. It helps them understand why some parts of life feel particularly challenging whilst they may be highly proficient in others. It also makes it easier to find a support community of people like oneself.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished reading: [Divergent Mind](https://micro.blog/books/9780062876812) by Jenara Nerenberg.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/9780062876812.jpg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Book cover of Divergent Mind\">\r\n\r\nThis book encourages us to consider a type of diversity less commonly considered in mainstream [diversity, equity and inclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion) efforts: the differences in how people think and feel, with a focus on how they process sensory input.\r\n\r\n>\"Temperament rights\" captures the idea that we should respect individual's temperament and neurology in the same way that we should respect other aspects of people such as their gender, sexuality, or ethnic identity.\r\n\r\nMuch of the focus is on people with high sensitivity. This is commonly an aspect of diagnoses like autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, synesthesia or those termed  \"highly sensitive people\", as well as present in plenty of people who have no medical diagnosis at all.\r\n\r\nLiving in a world not attuned for ones' sensory processing can be overwhelming, exhausting and frustrating. Things that seem perfectly normal to other people - loud music, crowds - can be very stressful. \"Everyday\" tasks we're all supposed to be able to do such as housework or adhering to deadlines might be difficult. At the same time they might truly excel in other areas of life. \r\n\r\nThe difficulties are compounded by the pressure those with these conditions feel to fit in, to appear \"normal\" throughout life. They do this by [masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_(personality)) their experience. They may feel compelled to do this in every aspect of life, including in social and workplace environments, silently facing an extra challenge many of us do not. Women are apparently particularly prone to this, with their behaviour in general being more policed within our patriarchal society, having been socialised to mask more often and more effectively.\r\n\r\nOf course this comes at a cost. Sufferers may appear to lash out or exhibit other behaviours determined by many to be \"bad\". They commonly present with comorbidities such as depression anxiety, shame, guilt, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and distorted self-image. Masking by definition precludes you from living a life in accordance with your true self. \r\n\r\nIt's very possible that the person concerned themselves doesn't realise what's causing their challenge. They might seek treatment just for the more visible symptoms of their condition rather than what underlies it, or another condition entirely, which is generally ineffective.\r\n\r\nOne criticism I've seen of the book is that it heavily focuses on a particular demographic of folk with neurodivergences - most obviously women, and in particular middle class women. There's not a ton of discussion about the effects of poverty, race, sexuality or other intersections of identity. I can see aspects in this in terms of the suggestions of how to live a life more compatible with one's sensitivities that are provided at times. Moving to a quieter neighborhood, redecorating your house, reading the latest research on neurodivergence or getting a new job more suited to your cognitive style are not exactly opportunities easily open to all.  \r\n\r\nOf course if you fit into this sort of demographic or know people who do, this might be a benefit rather than drawback when it comes to getting insight into yourself or others, And to be fair, many of the suggestions are more widely applicable. \r\n\r\nThe critical message of the importance of learning to accept yourself as you are and then working to accept others as they are is clearly a message that can benefit us all. If this book helps people that struggle through life for one reason or another understand they're not alone and certainly not broken or deficient then it'll obviously be a force for good. \r\n\r\nOn the gender front, a man with such a condition might be a little surprised at its female focus given the title doesn't make that so clear. But I guess it acts as a counterbalance against the dominance of maleness in past psychological and medical research, a topic the book goes into some detail about when it reviews the history of psychology as a discipline. Given some of these conditions may present differently in women than men one might need to read another book on top of this one for a full understanding.\r\n\r\nThere's also a inevitable tension here between the idea of celebrating neurodiversity versus the pathologisation of it. Under the former mindset, no-one's thinking or sensory style is right or wrong. There's tremendous amount of variation such that the concept of \"normal\" is itself largely flawed. Whether a mental tendency makes your life harder or easier is often really a product of societal and environmental choices rather than something inherent to the condition - consider the \"social model\" of disability.   Even what we regard as a disorder certainly has changed and will again change dramatically over time.\r\n\r\n>The DSM is more like a catalogue of current social ailments than scientific hardwired “diseases.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand people do often end up as being labelled as having a  disorder. Some who suffer may seek this out. This risks marking them as \"aberrant\", \"weird\" or \"sick\". Expectations may be lowered, judgements may be received. But such a label unfortunately is often necessary to gain access to healthcare or support systems.\r\n\r\nAlthough there can be upsides in carefully-used labels. Many people feel far better once they've found a label that seems to describe how they exist in the world, that what they experience is both \"real\" and acknowledged. It helps them understand why some parts of life feel particularly challenging whilst they may be highly proficient in others. It also makes it easier to find a support community of people like oneself.  The book contains many stories of women who couldn't understand why life seemed to be so much harder for them than others for years until finally, later in life they received a diagnosis. They often felt validated, and gained access to a language that allowed them to discuss their needs with others.\r\n\r\nAnd it's certainly hard to argue with some of the overall takeaways. Sentiments like the quote below are universally useful to bear in mind, even if it's not something I'd say is especially particular to the issue of neurodivergence.\r\n\r\n> There’s really nothing right or wrong about people; we’re all just people doing our best...It’s important that we see differences, that we don’t deny them; but let it stop there and respond to everyone with kindness and help.\r\n\r\nBut it might well be that the often invisible, misunderstood and hard-to-classify neurodivergences are an aspect of humanity that we're particularly bad at considering in this context. We should certainly do our best to fix that. Educating ourselves and others such that such variations in experience exist is surely an important first step in building a world that more people feel comfortable existing within.\r\n\r\nMy more detailed notes are [here](https://booknotes.amedcalf.com/2023/05/divergent-mind-thriving-in-a-world-that-wasnt-designed-for-you).\n",

But really the power of it makes it probably worth figuring out if you regularly have the sort of tasks to do that it might help with.\n\n<a href = \"https://rclone.org/\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/d8898986fd.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"92\" alt=\"Rclone logo\" /></a>\n",

				"title": "A few sites that offer blog hosting",
				"content_html": "<p>Something of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging\">return to blogging</a> seems to be in the air, at least in some circles. Whether inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/08/elon-musk-broke-twitter/\">semi-destruction of Twitter</a>, an increased awareness of the bad incentives and surveillance capitalism that are <a href=\"https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/\">infused within the places</a> where the world previously moved the bulk of its personal posting to in the past - the big social networks - or part of a vaguely-defined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/19/how-can-you-spot-a-vibe-shift-that-transforms-popular-culture-ask-me-i-literally-invented-the-term\">vibe shift</a>, it feels positive to me.</p>\n<p>But how to start a blog can be a bit less immediately obvious and accessible than signing up to Facebook is. First up, there&rsquo;s only one Facebook, one Instagram and so on - which is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/29/facebook-privacy-monopoly/\">part of the problem</a> - whereas you can host the same blog in many different places. That even includes on your own computer in your own house, although that&rsquo;s not to be recommended for most people! After all, a traditional blog is really just a website that displays pages in a certain format, so most places where you can write on the web you can blog. However for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t need to be too &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, particularly if they&rsquo;re not super familiar with web hosting or coding and prefer to focus on their post content, it&rsquo;s probably easiest to start off with a third-party host that is specifically designed to host blogs.</p>\n<p>Below is list of the ones I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;ll also add some thoughts as to what went through my mind when it came to choosing one myself. That said, one shouldn&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you do not want to spend your time reviewing the options, just pick one and start writing. Honestly if you were to just pick one at random you&rsquo;d probably end up somewhere that you have far more control over and access to more useful features than the mainstream social networks.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated who are in no mood to spend time exploring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">Wordpress.com</a> might be a reasonable default for traditional-style blogs because:\n<ul>\n<li>It&rsquo;s extremely widely used by individuals and big organisations for all sorts of sites. This means it&rsquo;s generally reliable, plus widespread enough that if it doesn&rsquo;t suit you then it&rsquo;s a format that some other blog hosts can import from which can make switching to another site later easier.</li>\n<li>There&rsquo;s a (permanently) free option if you don&rsquo;t mind them adding advertising to your posts. This might be especially good if you just want to see whether the blogging is something you are going to enjoy before spending time or money setting up something fancier,</li>\n<li>Wordpress probably can be cajoled to do almost anything in theory, although it might be complicated and/or expensive to fully customise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For something more akin to the social media posting experience - short posts with no titles, single photos etc. then if you&rsquo;re open to paying then <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> is one I use that&rsquo;s more aimed at this style of usage - although it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to write traditional long posts too; see for example the one you&rsquo;re currently reading! It does cost a subscription, but there&rsquo;s a free trial if you want to try it out (and a summer sale on at the time of writing). <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> offers another easy-to-use take on microblogging that has a ton in common with the bigger social media sites, for better or worse, including free options. But it comes at the cost of having less control over your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However if you have any interest in looking around then I&rsquo;d certainly recommend doing so to see if which of the options feel most in line with the ethos of what you want.</p>\n<p>As noted, you can build a blog with almost anything web-orientated. A text editor and some web hosting works. But to keep the list manageable, I&rsquo;ve only included those that are ready-to-use cloud services with functions tailored to blogging. As far as I know you can just sign up to use any of them and write a basic blog post that the whole internet-enabled-world can see with minimal effort or technical skill required.</p>\n<p>This means I&rsquo;ve excluded some big categories like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator\">static site generators</a> you&rsquo;d run on your own computer or anything involving setting up self-hosting. These have a good following but are a perhaps more effort than I&rsquo;d guess the average person new to blogging wants to deal with. But they certainly have advantages if you&rsquo;re minded to survey all options.</p>\n<p>Now the list. I&rsquo;ll include the tagline for each one in case that helps understand who they&rsquo;re targeting. To be clear, I&rsquo;m just pasting their tagline in, not my opinion.</p>\n<p>First, the three I currently personally use for various things.

But how exactly you write your posts might differ.\n<ul>\n<li>Some use &ldquo;block editors&rdquo; where you construct your posts out of a series of blocks for various types of content. For example maybe your post has a paragraph of text block, then an image block, and then another paragraph of text block that you can move around as you wish.</li>\n<li>Others are more like typical word processors. You just write your document and embed what you want within it in the same way as Google docs works.</li>\n<li>Is it a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\">WYSIWYG</a> interface? If not, is there some way to preview what the post looks like pre-publishing?</li>\n<li>How do you format text, define headings, add other media etc? Maybe you use menu items or keyboard shortcuts, again like Google Docs' default. Would you prefer to write in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\">markdown</a>? Can you edit the HTML directly? Sidenote: markdown is fairly easy to learn and after I did so I found I it invaluable to use in all sorts of places unrelated to blogging.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you prefer to write on the go, is the web editor easy to use on a phone? Does the provider have its own app you can write in?</li>\n<li>If you already have favourite writing apps, can they publish directly to your blog? For example, <a href=\"https://ia.net/\">iaWriter</a> can<a href=\"https://ia.net/writer/support/ipados/publish-to-blogging-platforms\"> publish directly</a> to several blog hosts. <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> has addins that can do things like <a href=\"https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog\">publish to micro.blog</a>. This is more likely if it&rsquo;s one of the big hosts or they use some API or protocol that&rsquo;s common. Although there&rsquo;s no need to over-complicate things, copy and paste usually works fine.</li>\n<li>Can you edit and update your posts? Almost certainly the answer here will be yes.</li>\n<li>Do you want to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future, or to edit the post dates for other reasons?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do you want your blog to look and work? How much technical ability do you want to expend to make it so?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much do you want to be able to customise your blog? It may be very little if your focus entirely on your writing or other content. After all most people are happy enough posting on social media where you basically have zero control over what it looks like. But it might also be a whole lot if you have a particular design in mind, especially one that&rsquo;s something other than the norm.</li>\n<li>Do you like the default format of the blog enough? That way you can just begin posting right away.</li>\n<li>Are there different pre-made themes you can easily apply to your blog? Do you like any of them?</li>\n<li>What elements of the design can you customise beyond any preset themes?</li>\n<li>How do you make these customisations? e.g. is it a case of point-and-click, filling in forms, selecting from dropdowns etc. or do you need to know some kind of code?</li>\n<li>If you do know or want to learn <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS\">CSS</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\">HTML</a> code, are you able to add that kind of custom code to your blog? It&rsquo;s likely the only way to get full control over its appearance, but it&rsquo;s also something that many people may have no interest in doing.</li>\n<li>If you want some interactivity beyond basic link-clicking, is that possible? Are there pre-made widgets or plugins that you can drop in? Is there ability to write <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\">Javascript</a> code or equivalent to add interactive features?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What type of content does the host support?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traditionally, blog posts have a title. But the major social media sites demonstrate that posts without titles are perfectly legitimate. Does the host work well with both posts that have and do not have titles, if you think you&rsquo;ll use both types?</li>\n<li>Can you make pages other than blog articles? For instance many people like to have a static &ldquo;About me&rdquo; type page that is outside the chronological flow of the regular blog posts.</li>\n<li>Can you directly upload pictures, videos, PDFs and any other types of file you might want to share. Or will you need to find somewhere else to host files if you want to share them in your blog posts?</li>\n<li>Are there limits on file sizes, types, etc?</li>\n<li>Are there any restrictions on what types of things you can embed from other sites? For instance, if you plan to share Youtube videos, you&rsquo;d want to know that they&rsquo;ll display nicely.</li>\n<li>Does it integrate with any other online services you&rsquo;d like to connect to it?</li>\n<li>Can you add custom code if you want to - HTML, CSS, Javascript, whatever?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On site navigation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a built-in site search feature?</li>\n<li>By default blogs are usually arranged in reverse chronological order. But are there further ways to organise or navigate through your posts? e.g. categories, tags, folders.</li>\n<li>Can you create menus, lists, tag clouds, or whatever else you think might help people to navigate your site?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a different topic, how does the hosting company make money? Are you comfortable with whatever the answer is?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some charge you a certain amount of money to host your blog, usually a monthly or annual subscription. These are often the most transparent but are of course not accessible to anyone who can&rsquo;t or doesn&rsquo;t want to afford the cost.</li>\n<li>Others are free or have a free offering. Of course they&rsquo;re not free for the company to actually run, so how do they make enough money to sustain themselves? For example it might be by:\n<ul>\n<li>displaying their own adverts on your site. If this is the case, are you comfortable with the adverts? Both content-wise and to whatever extent they track your readers.</li>\n<li>by collecting data, possibly covertly, from your readers.</li>\n<li>by relying on some users to upgrade to a paid offering.</li>\n<li>VC or other funding (but then what will happen when that runs out?).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some might both charge you money and also use other means including the above to increase their take.</li>\n<li>If they don&rsquo;t appear to have any way of making money&hellip;why not?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a few more points around longevity, if it&rsquo;s important to you that your blog will last. Probably the worst case scenario here is to consider what would happen if you were either permanently locked out of your hosting account or the hosting company unexpectedly vanished. But there are several other less dramatic but much more likely to happen issues around being locked into a given provider.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you easily back up your site? Can it be automated? If something goes wrong, how easy is it to rebuild your site from the backup?</li>\n<li>Can you export your posts if you decide you want to move hosts? How easy would it be to import them elsewhere? This includes your writing, but also any photos, videos, etc.</li>\n<li>Do you fully own your posts? Has the host any rights over them?</li>\n<li>Can you use a custom URL? i.e. a web address of myblog.com rather than e.g. a subdomain myblog.thehost.com. If so, not only does it look nicer and is probably more memorable and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; but it also gives you the possibility of moving your blog elsewhere in future without breaking all the links. For instance if you want to move your Wordpress blog &ldquo;myblog.wordpress.com&rdquo; to another host then you will have to tell all your readers to look in the new place. But if you owned &ldquo;myblog.com&rdquo; then you can move it wherever you like as long as the host supports custom URLs.\n<ul>\n<li>Note that you will usually have to pay an annual fee in order to purchase the domain name in the first place, separately from any blog hosting costs. It can be as cheap as a few pounds a year if you don&rsquo;t want anything too fancy or arcane.</li>\n<li>Some blog hosts might be able to arrange the purchase for you as part of the signup process. This can be convenient but isn&rsquo;t necessarily the cheapest option. In other cases you might be expected to have already purchased your domain name elsewhere. I use <a href=\"https://porkbun.com/\">Porkbun</a> for this at present.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If it&rsquo;s a site you pay for, what happens to your posts if you decide to stop paying for it?</li>\n<li>How long has the site been around? If it&rsquo;s very new it might in some sense be less &ldquo;proven&rdquo; than older sites, although of course all new services have to start somewhere.</li>\n<li>How big is the company? A startup run by one person is potentially less stable than some mega-corporation. But there may be many different reasons to prefer the former. And famously of course even the Google giant <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/\">has a habit</a> of shutting things down.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding audience interaction and discovery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want readers to be able to leave comments on your posts?  Should people have to log in to comment? Particularly if that&rsquo;s not the case, how is spam handled?\n<ul>\n<li>Note that if you love everything about a service other than the comments side of things then there are third-party services that provide commenting features that you might be able to integrate into your blog if you are prepared to make the effort and potentially an extra cost.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Do you want a contact form?</li>\n<li>Some hosts have their own kind of social media or discovery component relating to your blogs e.g. micro.blog has a <a href=\"https://micro.blog/about\">timeline</a> , Wordpress has a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/support/reader/\">reader</a>.</li>\n<li>Can you automate the sharing of your posts onto the big social media networks if you want to? What happens if users reply to them there?</li>\n<li>Do you want any other specific features around making it easy for people to email you, connect with you on social media, that kind of thing?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want readers to be able to subscribe to your blog beyond being able to read it on the web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the host offer an automatic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS feed</a> of your posts?</li>\n<li>Can readers subscribe to your posts as an email newsletter?</li>\n<li>Can readers subscribe via other means? For instance because <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub#:~:text=ActivityPub%20is%20an%20open%2C%20decentralized,for%20delivering%20notifications%20and%20content.\">ActivityPub protocol</a>, readers can <a href=\"https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95\">subscribe via Mastodon</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ones are probably more relevant if you&rsquo;re planning to make money from your blog. I&rsquo;m not interested in this at the present.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a facility to make private or subscriber only posts?</li>\n<li>Is there a paid membership concept? Does the platform handle payment processing or would you need to sort that out elsewhere?</li>\n<li>Can you run your own adverts? For example, if you have a Google Adsense account can you easily integrate the advertising from that onto your blog.</li>\n<li>Is it optimised for good search engine performance?</li>\n<li>If you post a link to your article on a social network does it show up in a nice format?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, some miscellany to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you the only writer for your site, or will it be important that more than one user can post, each having their own username?</li>\n<li>Do you want any kind of analytics? Some hosts have built-in analytics.\n<ul>\n<li>Note that if you like everything else about the host, there are third-party services that are specifically designed to provide analytics that you might be able to integrate into your blog separately if you are willing to spend the time and potentially money to do so.</li>\n<li>If the host does have built in analytics, are you comfortable with them and how they track users? Can you disable them if not?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you already have a blog that you want to move to this one, how easy will it be to import your existing posts?</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;ve sort of covered this one already, but it&rsquo;s a particular bugbear of mine at present! Does the site surveil your visitors with trackers and the like? This might be in theory for your own &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; (e.g. to show you analytics) or for their own money-making purposes.</li>\n<li>Is there an API that would let you either post to or retrieve from your blog programmatically, if that&rsquo;s something you envisage needing to do? Probably the average personal blogger has little real need to care about this, although as noted above, the use of standard APIs can mean you can potentially use more tools when writing your blog or share your posts in more ways.</li>\n</ul>\n",
				"content_text": "Something of a [return to blogging](https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging) seems to be in the air, at least in some circles. Whether inspired by the [semi-destruction of Twitter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/08/elon-musk-broke-twitter/), an increased awareness of the bad incentives and surveillance capitalism that are [infused within the places](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) where the world previously moved the bulk of its personal posting to in the past - the big social networks - or part of a vaguely-defined [vibe shift](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/19/how-can-you-spot-a-vibe-shift-that-transforms-popular-culture-ask-me-i-literally-invented-the-term), it feels positive to me.\n\nBut how to start a blog can be a bit less immediately obvious and accessible than signing up to Facebook is. First up, there's only one Facebook, one Instagram and so on - which is [part of the problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/29/facebook-privacy-monopoly/) - whereas you can host the same blog in many different places. That even includes on your own computer in your own house, although that's not to be recommended for most people! After all, a traditional blog is really just a website that displays pages in a certain format, so most places where you can write on the web you can blog. However for anyone who doesn't need to be too \"experimental\", particularly if they're not super familiar with web hosting or coding and prefer to focus on their post content, it's probably easiest to start off with a third-party host that is specifically designed to host blogs.\n\nBelow is list of the ones I've come across. I'll also add some thoughts as to what went through my mind when it came to choosing one myself. That said, one shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you do not want to spend your time reviewing the options, just pick one and start writing. Honestly if you were to just pick one at random you'd probably end up somewhere that you have far more control over and access to more useful features than the mainstream social networks.\n\nFor the uninitiated who are in no mood to spend time exploring:\n\n- [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) might be a reasonable default for traditional-style blogs because:\n\t- It's extremely widely used by individuals and big organisations for all sorts of sites. This means it's generally reliable, plus widespread enough that if it doesn't suit you then it's a format that some other blog hosts can import from which can make switching to another site later easier.\n\t- There's a (permanently) free option if you don't mind them adding advertising to your posts. This might be especially good if you just want to see whether the blogging is something you are going to enjoy before spending time or money setting up something fancier,\n\t- Wordpress probably can be cajoled to do almost anything in theory, although it might be complicated and/or expensive to fully customise. \n- For something more akin to the social media posting experience - short posts with no titles, single photos etc. then if you're open to paying then [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) is one I use that's more aimed at this style of usage - although it's perfectly possible to write traditional long posts too; see for example the one you're currently reading! It does cost a subscription, but there's a free trial if you want to try it out (and a summer sale on at the time of writing). [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) offers another easy-to-use take on microblogging that has a ton in common with the bigger social media sites, for better or worse, including free options. But it comes at the cost of having less control over your site.\n\nHowever if you have any interest in looking around then I'd certainly recommend doing so to see if which of the options feel most in line with the ethos of what you want. \n\nAs noted, you can build a blog with almost anything web-orientated. A text editor and some web hosting works. But to keep the list manageable, I've only included those that are ready-to-use cloud services with functions tailored to blogging. As far as I know you can just sign up to use any of them and write a basic blog post that the whole internet-enabled-world can see with minimal effort or technical skill required. \n\nThis means I've excluded some big categories like [static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) you'd run on your own computer or anything involving setting up self-hosting. These have a good following but are a perhaps more effort than I'd guess the average person new to blogging wants to deal with. But they certainly have advantages if you're minded to survey all options.\n\nNow the list. I'll include the tagline for each one in case that helps understand who they're targeting. To be clear, I'm just pasting their tagline in, not my opinion.\n\nFirst, the three I currently personally use for various things. Obviously this means I like them enough.\n\n- [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/):  \"Personal blogging that makes it easy to be social. Post short thoughts or long essays, share photos, all on your own blog.\"\n- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/):  \"Welcome to the world’s most popular website builder\" (I've linked to wordpress.com but there are many other sites also provide Wordpress.)\n- [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/): \"Get the best internet address that you’ve ever had\" (this one's blog feature is actually in beta so it's not even advertised as a feature, but there is one.)\n\nNow a few others that are primarily focussed on blogging that I feel like I've heard at least some positive feedback about.\n\n- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/): \"A privacy-first, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging platform\"\n- [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/): \"Publish your passions, your way.\"\n- [Blot.im](https://blot.im/): \"Blot turns a folder into a website.\"\n- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/): \"Turn your audience into a business.\" \n- [Medium](https://medium.com/): \"Publish, grow, and earn, all in one place.\"\n- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/): \"It's time to try Tumblr. You'll never be bored again.\"\n- [Write.as](https://write.as/): \"Type words, put them on the internet.\"\n\nThese ones I've heard of but know nothing whatsoever about:\n\n- [Blogstatic](https://blogstatic.io/): \"The simplest, most powerful way to create your new great–looking blog!\"\n- [Postach.io](https://postach.io/): \"The easiest way to blog. Turn an Evernote notebook into a beautiful blog or web site.\"\n- [Silvrback](https://www.silvrback.com/): \"The best at simple blogging.\"\n- [Superblog](https://superblog.ai/): \"Stop worrying about speed, SEO, and servers. Superblog is a blazing fast alternative to WordPress and Medium blogs.\"\n- [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/): \"A publishing platform.\"\n\nThe next few I understand to be more general \"make it easy to build any kind of website easily\" offerings. To be fair, Wordpress is really that these days. But they do have dedicated templates or features for bloggers so I've included them.\n\n- [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/): \"Everything to sell anything.\"\n- [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/) : \"Websites, eCommerce & Marketing in one place. So you can focus on what you love.\"\n- [Wix](https://www.wix.com/): \"Create a website without limits.\"\n\nOther categories you might consider include sites targeting newsletter creation, [Substack](https://substack.com/) being the obvious one. Although it's very much email newsletter focused,  people read your newsletters on the web, within a Substack app or, to some extent, via  RSS readers, which makes it bloggy. But it's set up to prioritise the newsletter side of things so unless that's your focus it might be of less interest.\n\n## Things you might consider\n\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of things that went through my mind when thinking about blogging platform choice. Honestly there's a lot here that you don't really need to care about at all in order to just start blogging, particularly if it's a personal blog. \n\nPlus if you do overlook something you later want to change, well, part of the joy of blogging is that you're almost never locked into anything. Change it later! Some people appear to enjoy changing their blog hosting every few months.\n\nSo certainly don't let not being up for reading incredible amounts of rambling about tiny decisions put you off getting started right away. It's important to remember that for a lot of people the alternative we're comparing blogging to is posting on social media where you have essentially no control over anything. \n\nBut in case like me you enjoy dramatically overthinking everything:\n\nHow do you want write your posts?\n\n- Likely all blog hosts have some kind of web editor you can use. But how exactly you write your posts might differ.\n\t- Some use \"block editors\" where you construct your posts out of a series of blocks for various types of content. For example maybe your post has a paragraph of text block, then an image block, and then another paragraph of text block that you can move around as you wish.\n\t- Others are more like typical word processors. You just write your document and embed what you want within it in the same way as Google docs works.\n\t- Is it a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) interface? If not, is there some way to preview what the post looks like pre-publishing?\n\t- How do you format text, define headings, add other media etc?

For example, [iaWriter](https://ia.net/) can[ publish directly](https://ia.net/writer/support/ipados/publish-to-blogging-platforms) to several blog hosts. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has addins that can do things like [publish to micro.blog](https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog). This is more likely if it's one of the big hosts or they use some API or protocol that's common. Although there's no need to over-complicate things, copy and paste usually works fine.\n- Can you edit and update your posts? Almost certainly the answer here will be yes.\n- Do you want to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future, or to edit the post dates for other reasons?\n\nHow do you want your blog to look and work?

For instance many people like to have a static \"About me\" type page that is outside the chronological flow of the regular blog posts.\n- Can you directly upload pictures, videos, PDFs and any other types of file you might want to share. Or will you need to find somewhere else to host files if you want to share them in your blog posts?\n- Are there limits on file sizes, types, etc?\n- Are there any restrictions on what types of things you can embed from other sites? For instance, if you plan to share Youtube videos, you'd want to know that they'll display nicely.\n- Does it integrate with any other online services you'd like to connect to it?\n- Can you add custom code if you want to - HTML, CSS, Javascript, whatever?\n\nOn site navigation:\n\n- Is there a built-in site search feature?\n- By default blogs are usually arranged in reverse chronological order. But are there further ways to organise or navigate through your posts? e.g. categories, tags, folders.\n- Can you create menus, lists, tag clouds, or whatever else you think might help people to navigate your site?\n\nOn a different topic, how does the hosting company make money? Are you comfortable with whatever the answer is?\n\n- Some charge you a certain amount of money to host your blog, usually a monthly or annual subscription. These are often the most transparent but are of course not accessible to anyone who can't or doesn't want to afford the cost.\n- Others are free or have a free offering. Of course they're not free for the company to actually run, so how do they make enough money to sustain themselves? For example it might be by:\n\t- displaying their own adverts on your site. If this is the case, are you comfortable with the adverts? Both content-wise and to whatever extent they track your readers. \n\t- by collecting data, possibly covertly, from your readers.\n\t- by relying on some users to upgrade to a paid offering.\n\t- VC or other funding (but then what will happen when that runs out?).\n- Some might both charge you money and also use other means including the above to increase their take.\n- If they don't appear to have any way of making money...why not?\n\nHere's a few more points around longevity, if it's important to you that your blog will last. Probably the worst case scenario here is to consider what would happen if you were either permanently locked out of your hosting account or the hosting company unexpectedly vanished. But there are several other less dramatic but much more likely to happen issues around being locked into a given provider.\n\n- Can you easily back up your site? Can it be automated? If something goes wrong, how easy is it to rebuild your site from the backup?\n- Can you export your posts if you decide you want to move hosts? How easy would it be to import them elsewhere? This includes your writing, but also any photos, videos, etc.\n- Do you fully own your posts? Has the host any rights over them?  \n- Can you use a custom URL? i.e. a web address of myblog.com rather than e.g. a subdomain myblog.thehost.com. If so, not only does it look nicer and is probably more memorable and \"professional\" but it also gives you the possibility of moving your blog elsewhere in future without breaking all the links. For instance if you want to move your Wordpress blog \"myblog.wordpress.com\" to another host then you will have to tell all your readers to look in the new place. But if you owned \"myblog.com\" then you can move it wherever you like as long as the host supports custom URLs. \n\t- Note that you will usually have to pay an annual fee in order to purchase the domain name in the first place, separately from any blog hosting costs. It can be as cheap as a few pounds a year if you don't want anything too fancy or arcane.\n\t- Some blog hosts might be able to arrange the purchase for you as part of the signup process. This can be convenient but isn't necessarily the cheapest option. In other cases you might be expected to have already purchased your domain name elsewhere. I use [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) for this at present.\n- If it's a site you pay for, what happens to your posts if you decide to stop paying for it?\n- How long has the site been around? If it's very new it might in some sense be less \"proven\" than older sites, although of course all new services have to start somewhere.\n- How big is the company? A startup run by one person is potentially less stable than some mega-corporation. But there may be many different reasons to prefer the former. And famously of course even the Google giant [has a habit](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/) of shutting things down.\n\nRegarding audience interaction and discovery:\n\n- Do you want readers to be able to leave comments on your posts?  Should people have to log in to comment? Particularly if that's not the case, how is spam handled?\n\t- Note that if you love everything about a service other than the comments side of things then there are third-party services that provide commenting features that you might be able to integrate into your blog if you are prepared to make the effort and potentially an extra cost.\n- Do you want a contact form?\n- Some hosts have their own kind of social media or discovery component relating to your blogs e.g. micro.blog has a [timeline](https://micro.blog/about) , Wordpress has a [reader](https://wordpress.com/support/reader/).\n- Can you automate the sharing of your posts onto the big social media networks if you want to? What happens if users reply to them there?\n- Do you want any other specific features around making it easy for people to email you, connect with you on social media, that kind of thing?\n\nIf you want readers to be able to subscribe to your blog beyond being able to read it on the web:\n- Does the host offer an automatic [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of your posts?\n- Can readers subscribe to your posts as an email newsletter?\n- Can readers subscribe via other means? For instance because [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) uses the [ActivityPub protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub#:~:text=ActivityPub%20is%20an%20open%2C%20decentralized,for%20delivering%20notifications%20and%20content.), readers can [subscribe via Mastodon](https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95).\n\nThese ones are probably more relevant if you're planning to make money from your blog. I'm not interested in this at the present.\n\n- Is there a facility to make private or subscriber only posts? \n- Is there a paid membership concept? Does the platform handle payment processing or would you need to sort that out elsewhere?\n- Can you run your own adverts? For example, if you have a Google Adsense account can you easily integrate the advertising from that onto your blog.\n- Is it optimised for good search engine performance?\n- If you post a link to your article on a social network does it show up in a nice format?\n\nFinally, some miscellany to consider:\n\n - Are you the only writer for your site, or will it be important that more than one user can post, each having their own username?\n - Do you want any kind of analytics? Some hosts have built-in analytics. \n\t- Note that if you like everything else about the host, there are third-party services that are specifically designed to provide analytics that you might be able to integrate into your blog separately if you are willing to spend the time and potentially money to do so. \n\t- If the host does have built in analytics, are you comfortable with them and how they track users? Can you disable them if not?\n- If you already have a blog that you want to move to this one, how easy will it be to import your existing posts?\n- We've sort of covered this one already, but it's a particular bugbear of mine at present! Does the site surveil your visitors with trackers and the like? This might be in theory for your own \"benefit\" (e.g. to show you analytics) or for their own money-making purposes. \n- Is there an API that would let you either post to or retrieve from your blog programmatically, if that's something you envisage needing to do? Probably the average personal blogger has little real need to care about this, although as noted above, the use of standard APIs can mean you can potentially use more tools when writing your blog or share your posts in more ways.\n",

Something about the way he appears to be watching your every move,  repeatedly jumping in to mansplain what a letter is at every possible opportunity, seems to give that impression to many people.</p>\n<p>Contrast that with the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; of the more modern voice assistants like Siri, Alexa et al. which usually defaulted to female-presenting personas in most places. Whilst still something of a surveillance style technology, they&rsquo;re designed to remain silent and invisible in the background until you specifically bark an order at them.

The assistant holds no power of agency beyond what the commander asks of it. It honours commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, apparently at least Apple has <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/07/31/apples-siri-is-no-longer-a-woman-by-default-but-is-this-really-a-win-for-feminism_partner/\">toned down</a> Siri in this respect. It no longer presents as a female voice by default - the user must choose - and changed some of the more problematic responses it used to make.</p>\n<p>Should you be one of the handful of people that miss Clippy, or, much more likely, someone that likes winding other people up, you can download a &ldquo;prank&rdquo; Clippy <a href=\"http://www.rjlpranks.com/pranks/clippy/\">here</a> that pops up independent of the usage of Microsoft Office with helpful messages like &ldquo;Your computer seems to be turned on&rdquo; - although it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been updated since the era of Windows 7 so YMMV.</p>\n<p>Of course the future doesn&rsquo;t always reflect the past. The technology behind this year&rsquo;s office-suited AI helpers is different and radically more powerful than a 20 year-old paperclip (so much so that some people worry that further developments in AI could lead to all humans <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai\">being <em>turned into</em> paperclips</a>).

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished reading <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781642595260\">We Do This &lsquo;Til We Free Us</a> by Mariame Kaba.</p>\n<p>In this book, Mariame Kaba presents a collection of short and readable articles - reprints of magazine or interviews for example - all dedicated to educating about and encouraging readers to take actions towards the total abolition of the prison system, and policing too. &ldquo;Defund the police&rdquo; taken to its most literal conclusion.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a position I started off with some sympathy towards. I am more than happy to accept that far more people are in prison than should be. This book focuses on the US system, and that is almost indisputably true there.</p>\n<p>I was already happy with the idea that the focus of the criminal justice system (or criminal punishment system, as she calls it - feeling there&rsquo;s very little justice to be had in it today) should be on issues such as safety and restitution rather than punishment for punishment&rsquo;s sake. Prison should be a last resort after all other options have been explored. There&rsquo;s a lot of reform to what prison entails, and the life of someone post-prison, that should be urgently made. Likewise policing - again, a last resort, after other arms of the state whose role is to assist people in need have done all they can.</p>\n<p>As far as I can see there is substantial evidence that much &ldquo;crime&rdquo; is driven by structural societal factors which opens many avenues for mass-scale prevention that could be invested to avoid incidents where people are even tempted to call the police occurring in the first place.</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;ve never quite been able to push myself to the full abolitionist perspective that prison and policing are entirely unnecessary. Kaba would probably consider that a lack of imagination, which I&rsquo;m happy to acknowledge. And so this book tries to provide the impetus for a full abolitionist outcome.</p>\n<p>There are many aspects to this. Below is my attempt to summarise some of her main points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-philosophical-argument\">The philosophical argument</h3>\n<p>Philosophically, the author entirely agrees that there should be consequences when people cause harm. However there is a difference between &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; that aim to help victims and make society at large and &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; that aims in part to make a perpetrator suffer. Sometimes they may look similar, but their goal is different and the latter is inhumane, however attractive it may be to those affected.</p>\n<p>But the priority should be addressing the conditions that allowed the harm to take place and the actual needs of the person to whom it was done to. The default of people locking people in cages away from our sight-line is an abdication of the responsibility we all have to help those harmed. It hides important social and political failures.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the system does nothing to encourage accountability. In fact it works against it. People cannot be forced to accept accountability. The current adversarial court system discourages people from taking personal and public responsibility for their actions because it&rsquo;s almost always in the perpetrator&rsquo;s interest to deny or minimise the harm the caused, even when they&rsquo;re fully aware and may like to make some kind of restitution. But if a guilty plea would result in inevitable imprisonment then they may find this unpalatable.</p>\n<p>Many &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; are in fact victims of something themselves; the victim / perpetrator binary is a fiction. Most women in US prisons are poor, of colour and have experienced physical violence from a partner. Without lessening any harm they commit, we can acknowledge that some criminal actions come from someone making choices that they should never have been put in the position of making.</p>\n<p>Hurt people hurt people; desperate people hurt people. Lessening social and economic inequities, and making other, non-criminalising, services easily available could go a long way to preventing the harm in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neutralizing perceived threats, in an endless game of legal whack-a-mole, is not a path to safety. To create safer environments, people and circumstances must be transformed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-legitimacy-argument\">The legitimacy argument.</h3>\n<p>Firstly we should examine the definition of crime. It&rsquo;s often arbitrary. Not everything that is criminalised is harmful. Not all harm is criminalised. A classic example of the latter is CEOs of companies who cause deaths by e.g. harmful, yet perfectly legal, environmental practices.</p>\n<p>Additionally, prejudice is rife within the US criminal justice system, notably in the conflation of Blackness with criminality. Black people are more likely to be arrested and more likely to get harsh sentences than white people for the same offence. Black victims of crime are more likely to be ignored.</p>\n<p>The current system doesn&rsquo;t truly even try to meet the needs of victims. Services like counselling, healthcare, housing or money are rarely on offer.</p>\n<p>Even in the domain of punishment the victim rarely has the final word. If the system requires the perpetrator to be be jailed then the are, irrespective of the victim&rsquo;s wishes.  The extreme case is someone being sentenced to death (remembering this book is mostly about the US) when the victim is virulent anti the death penalty. They may even feel like they have another person&rsquo;s death of their conscience unless they drop the charges.</p>\n<p>The rise of the &ldquo;prison industrial complex&rdquo; has produced economic incentives such for the  system to perpetuate itself it needs to increase the number people imprisoned and the duration of their sentences.</p>\n<p>Our response to violence and harm should not cause more violence and harm</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-efficacy-argument\">The efficacy argument</h3>\n<p>Kaba writes a lot about sexual abuse. This is a crime so pervasive and in some cases so horrific that being seen to argue against an offender going to prison is almost blasphemous even in - or perhaps especially in - liberal circles.</p>\n<p>But she raises fair points in that its very pervasiveness shows that the current system doesn&rsquo;t work Very few reported cases in any case get anywhere near court. Those that do often in reality lead the victim being put on trial more than the perpetrator. These and other factors means who suffer this harm rarely even report it, demonstrating a total lack of faith in the only system that today exists to supposedly help victims of harm.</p>\n<p>Harm caused by police officers - sexual misconduct is the second most common form of police violence - is very rarely punished.</p>\n<p>The public does not understand the practicalities of policing. Most US officers make just a 1 felony arrest a year. Most of their time is spent dealing with non-criminal issues such as traffic citation, noise complaints or wellness checks. Many of these would be better done by non-police personnel who have better training in for example mental health issues.</p>\n<p>In general, there is little-to-no evidence that prisons reduce violence, crime or people&rsquo;s fear of it. The US prison population increased by over 400% between 1979 and 2014. Neither crime or the fear of crime is 400% lower now.</p>\n<p>Some research suggests that going to prison <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/rethinking-prison-deterrent-future-crime\">increases the likelihood</a> that you will commit crime again in the future. It&rsquo;s not clear that they&rsquo;re even a deterrent in the first place - criminals do not tend to be dispassionately weighing up potential risks and rewards before making their choices.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;a system that never addresses the why behind a harm never actually contains the harm itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"reform-is-not-enough\">Reform is not enough</h2>\n<p>The author believes that reforming the system will never be enough, and may often be counterproductive.</p>\n<p>Previous reforms that may have been well-intentioned with regards to reducing the inhumanity of the prison industrial complex system tend to result in little more than more people being criminalised. A historical example is the introduction of women-only prisons and its relationship towards a far greater number of women being imprisoned.</p>\n<p>The only reforms she believes we should support are those that reduce the amount of contact the public has with the police and reduce the resources the police have access to. These are steps on the way to full abolition that immediately reduce the harm police can do to people.</p>\n<p>She believes that what we need beyond anything is imagination. Her view is that it&rsquo;s perfectly fine, even necessary, to criticise the system even if we don&rsquo;t have a fully fleshed out view of an alternative. Measures can be taken now to address issues that we do have solutions for, and real collective effort should be made to figure out the best way forward on those that we don&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>In the mean time, our lack of imagination has several adverse effects. We imagine that policing, prisons and surveillance are &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. This is not true. Prisons are a human invention; in fact a fairly recent one if we consider the current incarnation whose aim is to punish people who committed serious offences by locking them up for long periods of time.

Given one of the points here is that plentiful and well-resourced teachers are necessary for a good education to be delivered it's actually surprising to me that that figure is not higher. But it seems like they're correctly taking a longer, more structural, view.  They have a substantially higher level of concern present about the fact that education is suffering due to a lack of investment in schools and teachers (60%). Of course this concern of the majority is exactly what a lot of these strikes are about.\n\nFor what it's worth the same polls showed the British public to be net in support of strikes by nurses, ambulance workers, railway workers, border fore staff, civil servants and university support.  From the polled options, only strikes by driving instructors were more opposed (35%) than supported (28%).\n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/98a7676719.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2023/98a7676719.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n",

The latter categories can co-exist, and may by definition have to, with love - &ldquo;approaching romantic love from a foundation of care, knowledge and respect actually intensifies romance&rdquo;. But they&rsquo;re distinct.</p>\n<p>This has some implications. If you love someone then you will not deliberately harm them. You will not seek to dominate them. So, conversely, if you deliberately harm someone you cannot love them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By definition this precludes some parents from rightfully claiming to love their children.

And not for the better, even in the context of an industry that probably shouldn&rsquo;t exist in the first place. His agency pushed Valium to medical professionals, perfectly happy to make misleading or untruthful claims about the often-times dependency instigating drug all in the name of more sales sales sales.</p>\n<p>He shrunk away from the limelight in this context, becoming something of a shadowy figure in terms of his involvement in the business.

Arthur&rsquo;s brothers, and latterly their children, set themselves up to be the chief marketers for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone\">OxyContin</a>. This is an opiate developed in 1995 that&rsquo;s substantially more powerful as a painkiller than morphine, which  at the time was mainly used to treat the most severe pain of cancer and terminal patients as it was known to have potentially dangerous side effects including addiction .</p>\n<p>But the Sacklers had different plans for OxyContin. They marketing it to doctors as something suitable for everyone who suffers from any even moderate level of pain. With no evidence, and soon enough plenty of counter-evidence, they claimed it wasn&rsquo;t addictive - with a latterly galling slogan of it being a drug to &ldquo;to start with and to stay with&rdquo;. They had their sales people just repeat fake facts, such as that fewer than 1% of patients could become addicted to OxyContin.</p>\n<p>When people addicted to Oxy started to turn up, the company was always careful to indulge in victim blaming, arguing something along the lines of &ldquo;because we decided that the drug isn&rsquo;t addictive then this means anyone who seems to be addicted by definition must be of inferior moral character&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Within their pharmaceuticals company, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma\">Purdue Pharma</a>, they created and seemingly reveled in an atmosphere of willful ignorance and deliberate falsehoods, pushing doctors to purchase and prescribe more and higher doses of Oxycontin, no matter how appropriate the treatment was for the condition.

It&rsquo;s not that producing opiates is a problem. They&rsquo;re an important class of drugs that are very useful for specific medical conditions in specific contexts. It&rsquo;s the lying and cheating involved in mass-marketing them, as  entirely safe and problematic-side-effect free solutions to any form of pain,  in full knowledge of the human cost of doing so that is truly horrific.</p>\n<p>The Sacklers&rsquo;s pharma marketing business is easily up there with, say, the tobacco industry and the oil industry in terms of companies that knowingly inflict harm on the world whilst actively lying about it. \nPurdue is a privately held company, owned by some of an extremely wealthy family who so loved to show off their extraordinarily hypocritical philanthropy - so it doesn&rsquo;t even have the always-invalid excuse of &ldquo;shareholder interest&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s in some ways a tedious conspiracy, contra to the wilder accusations that fly around the world these days - just another example of appalling outcomes emanating from the actions and intention of people who just seem to want to become richer and richer, no matter how wealthy they become, no matter the human cost or obvious ethical breaches. They do what they do, largely unconstrained by the wholly inadequate systems we supposedly put in place to limit the social harms that we allow to be done in the name of profit.</p>\n<p>The book&rsquo;s author wrote <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain\">a piece for the New Yorker</a> a while back on the same topic which is well worth a read if you don&rsquo;t feel like tackling the whole book.</p>\n",

It's the lying and cheating involved in mass-marketing them, as  entirely safe and problematic-side-effect free solutions to any form of pain,  in full knowledge of the human cost of doing so that is truly horrific. \r\n\r\nThe Sacklers's pharma marketing business is easily up there with, say, the tobacco industry and the oil industry in terms of companies that knowingly inflict harm on the world whilst actively lying about it. \r\nPurdue is a privately held company, owned by some of an extremely wealthy family who so loved to show off their extraordinarily hypocritical philanthropy - so it doesn't even have the always-invalid excuse of \"shareholder interest\".  \r\n\r\nAlthough it's in some ways a tedious conspiracy, contra to the wilder accusations that fly around the world these days - just another example of appalling outcomes emanating from the actions and intention of people who just seem to want to become richer and richer, no matter how wealthy they become, no matter the human cost or obvious ethical breaches. They do what they do, largely unconstrained by the wholly inadequate systems we supposedly put in place to limit the social harms that we allow to be done in the name of profit.\r\n\r\nThe book's author wrote [a piece for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) a while back on the same topic which is well worth a read if you don't feel like tackling the whole book.\n",

No. Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair seismologists do have a pretty specific definition of &ldquo;predict&rdquo;. We can certainly say something about rates and magnitudes, for instance that in a particular region of the world there is a 40% probability that we&rsquo;ll see an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 within the next 10 years. This means that we  know that some regions have many more earthquakes than others. But no-one yet can say anything remotely close to &ldquo;tomorrow there will be a massive earthquake in your city&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;within the next 10 years&rdquo; in the above statement should be thought of as a rate. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you haven&rsquo;t had an earthquake in 9 years then you&rsquo;ll probably have one next year. But rather that for any given year you should act as though there is a 10% chance of such an event. Don&rsquo;t fall into a geological version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy\">the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy</a>!</p>\n<p>Why is it so hard for us to predict earthquakes? In his book &ldquo;<a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658\">The Signal and the Noise</a>&rdquo;, Nate Silver dedicates most of a chapter to the topic. Overall, it seems like we just don&rsquo;t know enough about what causes them and can&rsquo;t measure every one of their constituent parts at a granular enough level. They can be thought of as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy\">complex system</a> in which fairly simple-to-understand things interact with each other in ways that are essentially mysterious.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These types of systems exhibit non-linear properties and have steep feedback loops that mean tiny changes to one part of the model can end up wreaking absolute havoc to another of its aspect. These systems tend to remain static for most of the time, but then occasionally fail in a catastrophic way.</p>\n<p>As large earthquakes are rare, our inability to do anything beyond forecasting long term probabilities of suffering from a major earthquake is particularly dangerous for countries without access to great wealth. It&rsquo;s hard or impossible for poorer locales to prioritise taking very expensive precautions against these devastating events when it may be very unlikely that the event will happen in any particular year.</p>\n<p>Of course the wealth side of that is a solvable problem should the world decide that protecting the population of its most vulnerable countries is something that should become a moral priority, whether or not we ever come to fully understand the physics of earthquakes.</p>\n",

But no-one yet can say anything remotely close to \"tomorrow there will be a massive earthquake in your city\".\n\nThe \"within the next 10 years\" in the above statement should be thought of as a rate. It doesn't mean that if you haven't had an earthquake in 9 years then you'll probably have one next year. But rather that for any given year you should act as though there is a 10% chance of such an event. Don't fall into a geological version of [the gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy)!\n\nWhy is it so hard for us to predict earthquakes? In his book \"[The Signal and the Noise](https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658)\", Nate Silver dedicates most of a chapter to the topic. Overall, it seems like we just don't know enough about what causes them and can't measure every one of their constituent parts at a granular enough level. They can be thought of as a [complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy) in which fairly simple-to-understand things interact with each other in ways that are essentially mysterious. \n\n> Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment\n\nThese types of systems exhibit non-linear properties and have steep feedback loops that mean tiny changes to one part of the model can end up wreaking absolute havoc to another of its aspect. These systems tend to remain static for most of the time, but then occasionally fail in a catastrophic way.\n\nAs large earthquakes are rare, our inability to do anything beyond forecasting long term probabilities of suffering from a major earthquake is particularly dangerous for countries without access to great wealth. It's hard or impossible for poorer locales to prioritise taking very expensive precautions against these devastating events when it may be very unlikely that the event will happen in any particular year.\n\nOf course the wealth side of that is a solvable problem should the world decide that protecting the population of its most vulnerable countries is something that should become a moral priority, whether or not we ever come to fully understand the physics of earthquakes.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/\">a recent post</a>, Cory Doctorow explained his theory of &ldquo;platform enshittification&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s enabled by (particularly online) platforms, being the middleman between the purveyors of &ldquo;content&rdquo; and their audience, having the ability to directly change how much value they hand out each party and themselves.</p>\n<p>In stage 1, the platform wants to attract users, so it dedicates most of the value it generates to them. Us willing consumers embrace this wonderful deal and sign up en masse. Businesses see how many users are on the platform and started becoming interested themselves.</p>\n<p>In stage 2, the platform starts shifting the value to the suppliers. The consumer experience declines whilst the platform redirects its value towards its suppliers. They pay businesses or creators to use them. They offer an unmissably cheap way to access big audiences of avid potential consumers just desperate to throw money at them; the users from step 1. Businesses sign up en masse.</p>\n<p>In the final stage, the platform starts taking more and more of the value for itself.

				"content_text": "In [a recent post](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/), Cory Doctorow explained his theory of \"platform enshittification\"\r\n\r\nIt's enabled by (particularly online) platforms, being the middleman between the purveyors of \"content\" and their audience, having the ability to directly change how much value they hand out each party and themselves.\r\n\r\nIn stage 1, the platform wants to attract users, so it dedicates most of the value it generates to them. Us willing consumers embrace this wonderful deal and sign up en masse. Businesses see how many users are on the platform and started becoming interested themselves.\r\n\r\nIn stage 2, the platform starts shifting the value to the suppliers. The consumer experience declines whilst the platform redirects its value towards its suppliers. They pay businesses or creators to use them. They offer an unmissably cheap way to access big audiences of avid potential consumers just desperate to throw money at them; the users from step 1. Businesses sign up en masse.\r\n\r\nIn the final stage, the platform starts taking more and more of the value for itself. They take vast swathes of fees from businesses, and deluge consumers in whatever substandard experience is deemed most optimal to generate revenue for the platform's shareholders, just one level away from being so horrible that the users quit.\r\n\r\nThis, according to Doctorow, is the death knell for a platform.\r\n\r\nHe sees this happening  with Amazon, which started off making it very convenient for people to find and make good purchases at great prices. They  subsidised each sale, causing many of their competitors to close. We loved the prices, and the convenience.

I guess a fraction of a TikTok video would do the job.\r\n\r\nIt can even preserve emotion - so if you have a 3 second clip of your friend angrily shouting about something then they could in theory make a clip of your friend angrily shouting about something completely different.\r\n\r\nRight now I don't think you can play with the model yourself. Some people might feel that's in some ways for the best , until society has figured out some idea of how we're going to deal with the sheer amount of future \"recordings\" of things that never happened that everyone is going to be able to produce with minimal effort using with tools like this and the various other generative AI type tools that are already out there. \r\n\r\nBut I imagine someone else will release a more public tool all too soon. It didn't take long for folk to figure out how to [get AI tools to generate images](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgygy4/stable-diffusion-stability-ai-nsfw-ai-generated-porn) that are really rather against what most of the systems designers involved wanted them to do.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time you can hear some Vall-E samples on [this page](https://valle-demo.github.io/). Scroll down a bit and compare the \"Speaker Prompts\" - which are the 3 second actual recordings of someone's voice they fed it - with the \"VALL-E\" output, which is what the model produced based on it.\n",

				"title": "Mental illness as a 'sane response to an insane world'",
				"content_html": "<p>One idea that has been circling around my head a lot recently is how we commonly treat the recent &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; of mental illness as something specifically pertaining to the individual sufferers concerned. We&rsquo;re often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don&rsquo;t step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it.</p>\n<p>In the book <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&amp;author=Alex+Iantaffi&amp;cover_id=32801\">Life Isn&rsquo;t Binary</a>, Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The pain and struggles are entirely real, there&rsquo;s no questioning of that. But in many cases they&rsquo;re also understandable without recourse to individual &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;. They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&amp;author=Johann+Hari&amp;cover_id=32781\">Lost Connections</a>, Hari notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved responses to dangers that may not be &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for today&rsquo;s challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They&rsquo;re a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat.</p>\n<p>In some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.</p>\n<p>As is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I&rsquo;ve read in recent times. But it&rsquo;s not clear to me that it&rsquo;s reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials.</p>\n<p>This is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people&rsquo;s very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.</p>\n<p>A quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Human Nature&rsquo;, which runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The capacity to become depressed&hellip;is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth&hellip;the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I&rsquo;m aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it&rsquo;s often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they&rsquo;re of &ldquo;bad character&rdquo; (whatever that means) or that they&rsquo;re somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he&rsquo;s only <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html\">second richest</a> now)?</p>\n<p>If we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn&rsquo;t we find it strange if they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself.</p>\n<p>Perhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you&rsquo;re suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it&rsquo;s a perfect normal phenomenon. You don&rsquo;t need treatment. There&rsquo;s nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw.</p>\n<p>But very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.</p>\n<p>By many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645\">The Better Angels of our Nature</a>&rdquo; as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it&rsquo;s very often a fallacy to think &ldquo;things must have been better in every way a few decades ago&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we&rsquo;d be guaranteed happiness&rdquo;.   But even if the direction <em>has</em> generally been positive in the past, then there&rsquo;s no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way.</p>\n<p>But the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think &ldquo;oh man, that&rsquo;s wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe <em>that</em> was OK?&rdquo; about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today&rsquo;s standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.</p>\n<p>But another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from <em>not</em> taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> manner of addressing their pain.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let&rsquo;s say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical &ldquo;brain treatment&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so.</p>\n<p>Most damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out.</p>\n<p>As just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/\">highly associated</a> with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently\">was apparently almost eliminated </a>and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation.</p>\n<p>It seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318\">end the scheme</a>. Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_\">back to having no accommodation</a> It&rsquo;s feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis\">tidal wave</a>&rdquo; of new homelessness, and given the <a href=\"https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society\">acknowledged connection</a> between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.</p>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html\">New York Times opinion article</a> provided the following metaphor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If something about some people&rsquo;s lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn&rsquo;t also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.</p>\n<p>Therapising someone who&rsquo;s anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don&rsquo;t have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else&rsquo;s whim. Someone who didn&rsquo;t respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me.</p>\n<p>If their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness\">feel like they have no friends</a>? A society where financial security depends in part <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/\">upon your race</a>? That those who live in some areas <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492\">die many years earlier</a> than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand</a>?</p>\n<p>This becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&amp;author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&amp;cover_id=32791\">The Body Keeps The Score,</a> the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven&rsquo;t fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.</p>\n<p>In her book, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942\">All Our Relations</a>, Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in.</p>\n<p>She reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24.</p>\n<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system\">Indian Residential schools</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn&rsquo;t suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.</p>\n<p>Today Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.</p>\n<p>A related critique of the &ldquo;DSM-5&rdquo; type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in <a href=\"https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf\">their response</a> to the development of the that system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.\nThis misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In all this I want to remember that it&rsquo;s very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn&rsquo;t due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.</p>\n<p>Furthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts.</p>\n<p>A categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you.</p>\n<p>Despite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/\">especially for rarer conditions</a>. In 2016, Naslund et al. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783\">wrote</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like &ldquo;they are their illness&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can&rsquo;t help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - &ldquo;given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks&rdquo;, to quote the Naslund paper.</p>\n<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Recently the results of a <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/\">National Health Service</a> intervention that involved the prescribing of heating <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689\">reported success</a>. &ldquo;Prescribing heating&rdquo; simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs\"> dramatic increase in energy costs</a> in recent times.</p>\n<p>Many illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It&rsquo;s estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS £860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but <a href=\"https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf\">the report that calculated the £860 million figure</a> does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.</p>\n<p>In 2018 we saw a &ldquo;social prescribing&rdquo; initiative that would enable doctors <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/\">to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments</a> for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf\">anti-loneliness strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>The NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/\">wide range of people</a>, including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, <a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing\">reporting</a>) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental.</p>\n<p>Of course, as with almost anything, there&rsquo;s a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being &ldquo;socially-prescribed&rdquo; to on the basis that it&rsquo;s a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don&rsquo;t know).</p>\n<p>It will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment <a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf\">for patients with mild mental illnesses</a>. For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.</p>\n<p>Social prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.</p>\n<p>Many, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you&rsquo;re already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace.</p>\n<p>One example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/\">Trussell Trust,</a> who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf\">a report</a> by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020.</p>\n<p>Intuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can&rsquo;t do a lot for the person&rsquo;s ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life.</p>\n<p>In the words of the Big Issue&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/\">writeup of the report</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a &lsquo;toxic environment&rsquo; for their mental health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report\">A third</a> of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film &ldquo;<a href=\"https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016\">I, Daniel Blake</a>&rdquo; portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607\">There are certainly people</a> who don&rsquo;t seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed\">polling</a> showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of £10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf\">the Government report</a> correctly.</p>\n<p>As it stands, <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/\">one study</a> found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants.</p>\n<p>With all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven&rsquo;t looked much into work in this area.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://covidrealities.org/\">Covid Realities project</a> did however find instances of people describing the latter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&hellip;parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; improve the former.</p>\n<p>For those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by £20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients.</p>\n<p>This £20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609\">chose to abolish</a> even that £20 increase.</p>\n<p>Many experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including <a href=\"https://mentalhealth-uk.org/\">Mental Health UK</a>, who <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217\">highlighted the dangerous loop effect</a> between mental health and poverty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is not just a financial issue; we’re very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bps.org.uk/\">British Psychological Society</a> had similar concerns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people&rsquo;s lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way.</p>\n<p>There are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in.</p>\n<p>But however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "One idea that has been circling around my head a lot recently is how we commonly treat the recent \"epidemic\" of mental illness as something specifically pertaining to the individual sufferers concerned. We're often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal \"problematic\" biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don't step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it. \n\nIn the book [Life Isn't Binary](https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&author=Alex+Iantaffi&cover_id=32801), Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:\n\n>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.\n\nThe pain and struggles are entirely real, there's no questioning of that. But in many cases they're also understandable without recourse to individual \"abnormalities\". They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.\n\nOftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In [Lost Connections](https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&author=Johann+Hari&cover_id=32781), Hari notes:\n\n> It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.\n\nWe've evolved responses to dangers that may not be \"useful\" for today's challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They're a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat. \n\nIn some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.                                                              \n\nAs is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I've read in recent times. But it's not clear to me that it's reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials. \n\nThis is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people's very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.\n\nA quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott's book 'Human Nature', which runs as follows:\n\n>The capacity to become depressed...is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth...the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.\n\nI think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I'm aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it's often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they're of \"bad character\" (whatever that means) or that they're somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he's only [second richest](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html) now)? \n\nIf we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn't we find it strange if they *didn't* ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself. \n\nPerhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it's perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you're suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it's a perfect normal phenomenon. You don't need treatment. There's nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw. \n\nBut very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.\n\nBy many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker's \"[The Better Angels of our Nature](https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645)\" as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it's very often a fallacy to think \"things must have been better in every way a few decades ago\" or \"if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we'd be guaranteed happiness\".   But even if the direction *has* generally been positive in the past, then there's no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way. \n\nBut the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think \"oh man, that's wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe *that* was OK?\" about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today's standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.\n\nBut another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from *not* taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary *and sufficient* manner of addressing their pain. \n\nI'm absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let's say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical \"brain treatment\" doesn't do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so. \n\nMost damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out. \n\nAs just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to \"solve\" homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is [highly associated](https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/) with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness [was apparently almost eliminated ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently)and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation. \n\nIt seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to [end the scheme](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318). Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are [back to having no accommodation](https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_) It's feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a \"[tidal wave](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis)\" of new homelessness, and given the [acknowledged connection](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society) between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.\n\nA recent [New York Times opinion article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html) provided the following metaphor:\n\n> If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.\n\nIf something about some people's lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn't also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.\n\nTherapising someone who's anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn't do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don't have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else's whim. Someone who didn't respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me. \n\nIf their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials [feel like they have no friends](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness)? A society where financial security depends in part [upon your race](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/)? That those who live in some areas [die many years earlier](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492) than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you [were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/)?\n\nThis becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so. \n\nIn [The Body Keeps The Score,](https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&cover_id=32791) the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5) (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven't fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.\n\nIn her book, [All Our Relations](https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942), Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in. \n\nShe reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24. \n\nBut this wasn't always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the \"[Indian Residential schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system)\". \n\nThe natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn't suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.\n\nToday Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.\n\nA related critique of the \"DSM-5\" type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in [their response](https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf) to the development of the that system.\n\n>...systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.\nThis misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems\n\nIn all this I want to remember that it's very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn't due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.\n\nFurthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts. \n\nA categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you. \n\nDespite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps [especially for rarer conditions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/). In 2016, Naslund et al. [wrote](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783)\n\n> People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.\n\nA potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like \"they are their illness\" and that it's a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can't help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - \"given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks\", to quote the Naslund paper.\n\nWhilst I'm don't get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues. \n\nRecently the results of a [National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/) intervention that involved the prescribing of heating [reported success](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689). \"Prescribing heating\" simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the[ dramatic increase in energy costs](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs) in recent times. \n\nMany illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It's estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS £860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but [the report that calculated the £860 million figure](https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf) does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.\n\nIn 2018 we saw a \"social prescribing\" initiative that would enable doctors [to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/) for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government's [anti-loneliness strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf).\n\nThe NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a [wide range of people](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/), including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, [reporting](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing)) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental. \n\nOf course, as with almost anything, there's a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being \"socially-prescribed\" to on the basis that it's a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don't know). \n\nIt will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment [for patients with mild mental illnesses](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf). For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.\n\nSocial prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.\n\nMany, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you're already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace. \n\nOne example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the [Trussell Trust,](https://www.trusselltrust.org/) who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.  \n\nAccording to [a report](https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf) by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020. \n\nIntuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:\n\n> It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.\n\nIn the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can't do a lot for the person's ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life. \n\nIn the words of the Big Issue's [writeup of the report](https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/), \n\n> Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a 'toxic environment' for their mental health.\n\n[A third](https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report) of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems. \n\nFurthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film \"[I, Daniel Blake](https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016)\" portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way. \n\n[There are certainly people](https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607) who don't seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.\n\nA few years ago, [polling](https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed) showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of £10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it's worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read [the Government report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf) correctly.\n\nAs it stands, [one study](https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/) found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants. \n\nWith all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven't looked much into work in this area.  \n\nThe [Covid Realities project](https://covidrealities.org/) did however find instances of people describing the latter:\n\n> ...parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.\n\nIn any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely \"automatically\" improve the former.\n\nFor those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by £20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients. \n\nThis £20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government [chose to abolish](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609) even that £20 increase. \n\nMany experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including [Mental Health UK](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/), who [highlighted the dangerous loop effect](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217) between mental health and poverty.\n\n> This is not just a financial issue; we’re very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.\n\nThe [British Psychological Society](https://www.bps.org.uk/) had similar concerns:\n\n> This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.\n\nNonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people's lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way. \n\nThere are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in. \n\nBut however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Below are notes I took whilst reading the paper &ldquo;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23088\">Self-Monitoring via Digital Health in Weight Loss Interventions - A Systematic Review Among Adults with Overweight or Obesity</a>&rdquo;, by Michele L. Patel, Lindsay N. Wakayama and Gary G. Bennett.</p>\n<p>Self-monitoring is a key component of standard treatments for obesity. Using digital tools, as opposed to paper-based monitoring, may reduce some of the obstacles faced when someone tries to do this, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They may reduce the time it takes to track one&rsquo;s diet, e.g. with nutrition databases that automatically populate nutrition info, or features that suggest entries.</li>\n<li>Wearable technologies allow for passive rather than active monitoring.</li>\n<li>We may be able to raise engagement levels via individualised feedback and prompts.</li>\n<li>Phones are very portable meaning that monitoring can be done in real time wherever you are, rather than retrospectively.</li>\n<li>They may reduce numeracy and health literacy barriers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This paper reviews 39 randomised controlled trials published between 2009 and 2019 which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>featured interventions designed to aid weight loss for participants with overweight or obesity.</li>\n<li>involved the use of digital tracking tools.</li>\n<li>had  interventions that lasted at least 12 weeks and included outcomes around self-monitoring engagement and a weight loss outcome from at least 6 months after enrollment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Its primary aim is to determine whether digital self-monitoring is associated with weight loss. Secondarily, it looks to understand the types of digital methods used for self-monitoring and their engagement rates in the associated interventions.</p>\n<p>Of the 67 interventions involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>72% of them involved self-monitoring of weight.</li>\n<li>81% involved self-monitoring of dietary intake. Mostly this involved tracking food intake or calories.</li>\n<li>82% involved self-monitoring of physical activity. Mostly this meant tracking the durations of physical activity, but sometimes it was step count, types of exercises or other related items.</li>\n<li>7% self-monitored specific behaviour change goals.</li>\n<li>54% included monitoring all of weight, dietary intake and activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most commonly this was done via a website (66% of treatment arms), with a lower number using mobile apps (33%), wearable devices (16%), electronic scales (12%) and text messaging (12%), PDAs (3%) or IVR technology (3%). In several cases participants were given a choice as to which method they preferred.</p>\n<p>Some interventions used commercial websites or apps, others used websites specific to the study.</p>\n<p>Only 9% of interventions that recommended daily digital self-monitoring engagement saw participants engage for at least 75% of the days concerned.  58% of arms saw engagements for at least half of the recommended days.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These numbers are higher in shorter interventions and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Engagement was highest when the intervention involved self-monitoring weight. The rate was somewhat lower for diet monitoring, and lower yet for physical activity. This may be confounded by differences in the frequency prescribed the opportunities to to record.</li>\n<li>Engagement was typically higher with digital as opposed to paper-based monitoring.</li>\n<li>The addition of counselling usually didn&rsquo;t increase the engagement rate.</li>\n<li>Passive self-monitoring behaviours (e.g. wearable devices) had higher engagement rates than active self-monitoring methods, although one study showed that passive weight tracking was less associated with weight loss, perhaps because it doesn&rsquo;t promote awareness of one&rsquo;s behaviour as much.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some studies compared engagement outcomes between monitoring modalities. Factors that were associated with engagement when comparison were possible include the use of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>incentives.</li>\n<li>enhancements.</li>\n<li>a wearable device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a positive association between high levels of digital self-monitoring and increased weight loss in 74% of cases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rates didn&rsquo;t differ much based on what was monitored, with the exception that of the 3 studies that involved monitoring behaviour change goals only 1 showed an association with weight loss.</li>\n<li>Interventions that lasted at least 12 months were less likely to show an association than those that were shorter. This may either be because of rates self-monitoring engagement or weight loss declining over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One limitation of these studies is that participants were never randomised to different levels of self-monitoring; thus high frequency monitors are self-selected and may differ from each other in other ways.</p>\n<p>Researchers should use strategies such as the multiphase optimisation strategy to understand the different impact of different self-monitoring strategies.</p>\n<p>Research into how to prevent the decline in self-monitoring engagement over time is needed, as well as understanding the predictors and moderators of self-monitoring engagements.

Patel, Lindsay N. Wakayama and Gary G. Bennett.\r\n\r\nSelf-monitoring is a key component of standard treatments for obesity. Using digital tools, as opposed to paper-based monitoring, may reduce some of the obstacles faced when someone tries to do this, because:\r\n\r\n- They may reduce the time it takes to track one's diet, e.g. with nutrition databases that automatically populate nutrition info, or features that suggest entries.\r\n- Wearable technologies allow for passive rather than active monitoring.\r\n- We may be able to raise engagement levels via individualised feedback and prompts.\r\n- Phones are very portable meaning that monitoring can be done in real time wherever you are, rather than retrospectively.\r\n- They may reduce numeracy and health literacy barriers.\r\n\r\nThis paper reviews 39 randomised controlled trials published between 2009 and 2019 which:\r\n- featured interventions designed to aid weight loss for participants with overweight or obesity.\r\n- involved the use of digital tracking tools.\r\n- had  interventions that lasted at least 12 weeks and included outcomes around self-monitoring engagement and a weight loss outcome from at least 6 months after enrollment.\r\n\r\nIts primary aim is to determine whether digital self-monitoring is associated with weight loss. Secondarily, it looks to understand the types of digital methods used for self-monitoring and their engagement rates in the associated interventions.\r\n\r\nOf the 67 interventions involved:\r\n\r\n- 72% of them involved self-monitoring of weight.\r\n- 81% involved self-monitoring of dietary intake. Mostly this involved tracking food intake or calories. \r\n- 82% involved self-monitoring of physical activity. Mostly this meant tracking the durations of physical activity, but sometimes it was step count, types of exercises or other related items.\r\n- 7% self-monitored specific behaviour change goals.\r\n- 54% included monitoring all of weight, dietary intake and activity.\r\n\r\nMost commonly this was done via a website (66% of treatment arms), with a lower number using mobile apps (33%), wearable devices (16%), electronic scales (12%) and text messaging (12%), PDAs (3%) or IVR technology (3%). In several cases participants were given a choice as to which method they preferred.\r\n\r\nSome interventions used commercial websites or apps, others used websites specific to the study.\r\n\r\nOnly 9% of interventions that recommended daily digital self-monitoring engagement saw participants engage for at least 75% of the days concerned.  58% of arms saw engagements for at least half of the recommended days. \r\n\r\n- These numbers are higher in shorter interventions and vice versa.\r\n- Engagement was highest when the intervention involved self-monitoring weight. The rate was somewhat lower for diet monitoring, and lower yet for physical activity. This may be confounded by differences in the frequency prescribed the opportunities to to record.\r\n- Engagement was typically higher with digital as opposed to paper-based monitoring.\r\n- The addition of counselling usually didn't increase the engagement rate. \r\n- Passive self-monitoring behaviours (e.g. wearable devices) had higher engagement rates than active self-monitoring methods, although one study showed that passive weight tracking was less associated with weight loss, perhaps because it doesn't promote awareness of one's behaviour as much.\r\n\r\nSome studies compared engagement outcomes between monitoring modalities. Factors that were associated with engagement when comparison were possible include the use of:\r\n\r\n- incentives.\r\n- enhancements.\r\n- a wearable device.\r\n\r\nThere was a positive association between high levels of digital self-monitoring and increased weight loss in 74% of cases. \r\n\r\n- The rates didn't differ much based on what was monitored, with the exception that of the 3 studies that involved monitoring behaviour change goals only 1 showed an association with weight loss.\r\n- Interventions that lasted at least 12 months were less likely to show an association than those that were shorter. This may either be because of rates self-monitoring engagement or weight loss declining over time.\r\n\r\nOne limitation of these studies is that participants were never randomised to different levels of self-monitoring; thus high frequency monitors are self-selected and may differ from each other in other ways.\r\n\r\nResearchers should use strategies such as the multiphase optimisation strategy to understand the different impact of different self-monitoring strategies.\r\n\r\nResearch into how to prevent the decline in self-monitoring engagement over time is needed, as well as understanding the predictors and moderators of self-monitoring engagements. Personalisation may be needed; some people may succeed more on one self-monitoring approach than others.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time adults with overweight or obesity should be encouraged to self-monitor frequently when undergoing interventions that are aimed at weight loss.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat shocked to feel this way given the source, but I don&rsquo;t hate all the policies from the Conservative&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget\">autumn statement</a> announced yesterday. At least not in the short term.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much changes within a few weeks. Whilst some of the policies under the Truss administration <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/07/freezing-tax-thresholds.html\">weren&rsquo;t nearly as tax-cutting as it seemed</a> on the surface, they were <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html\">extremely regressive</a>. Just last month we were hearing that the top rate of income tax was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2022/oct/02/liz-truss-admits-mistakes-over-mini-budget-but-stands-by-45-top-rate-tax-cut-video\">going to be entirely abolished</a> - free money for the rich! And now under the Sunak administration it&rsquo;s actually going to be applied to more people; anyone with an income of over around £125k as opposed to the current £150k.</p>\n<p>Benefits are going up inline with inflation, we&rsquo;re seeing an increase in capital gains tax and a fiscal drag on inheritance tax. And a windfall tax on the incredible profits of energy producers. All very un-Conservative-stereotype.</p>\n<p>Overall it&rsquo;s still grim news in the economy - basically everyone is going to be worse off in the near feature. Living standards are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/biggest-hit-to-living-standards-on-record-as-jeremy-hunt-lays-out-autumn-statement\">set to fall</a> by an unprecedented 7%. Plenty of this is due to the <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/13/some-context-as.html\">abject mismanagement</a> of the economy by the Conservative party in recent times.

				"content_text": "I'm somewhat shocked to feel this way given the source, but I don't hate all the policies from the Conservative's [autumn statement](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget) announced yesterday. At least not in the short term.\r\n\r\nIt's amazing how much changes within a few weeks. Whilst some of the policies under the Truss administration [weren't nearly as tax-cutting as it seemed](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/07/freezing-tax-thresholds.html) on the surface, they were [extremely regressive](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html). Just last month we were hearing that the top rate of income tax was [going to be entirely abolished](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2022/oct/02/liz-truss-admits-mistakes-over-mini-budget-but-stands-by-45-top-rate-tax-cut-video) - free money for the rich! And now under the Sunak administration it's actually going to be applied to more people; anyone with an income of over around £125k as opposed to the current £150k.\r\n\r\nBenefits are going up inline with inflation, we're seeing an increase in capital gains tax and a fiscal drag on inheritance tax. And a windfall tax on the incredible profits of energy producers. All very un-Conservative-stereotype.\r\n\r\nOverall it's still grim news in the economy - basically everyone is going to be worse off in the near feature. Living standards are [set to fall](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/biggest-hit-to-living-standards-on-record-as-jeremy-hunt-lays-out-autumn-statement) by an unprecedented 7%. Plenty of this is due to the [abject mismanagement](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/13/some-context-as.html) of the economy by the Conservative party in recent times.  Unemployment, inflation and energy bills are all set to rise. If you're already struggling that's obviously a much huger burden than if you're doing well enough right now.\n\nThe statement's policies are not nearly enough to make life particularly bearable for anyone already in or near crisis. But, I guess, credit where credit's due - the tax changes announced yesterday are actually somewhat progressive.\r\n\r\nHere's a reproduction of the impact [calculated by the Resolution Foundation](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/help-today-squeeze-tomorrow/) provided by [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/british-people-poorer-ifs-uk-autumn-statement).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/8fdae50376.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"479\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nWhere the statement is rather more disingenuous is with regards to cuts in public funding. Cuts to public services tend to impact the poorest in society more than the rich. Cuts are certainly in the statement, and they're big (and [dangerous](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/austerity-policies-kill.html)).

				"content_html": "<p>Things like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167\">this</a> are exactly what cause me <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html\">angst about joining the Labour party</a>.</p>\n<p>To be fair the headline &ldquo;<em>Keir Starmer: Too many people from overseas recruited to NHS</em>&rdquo; is a little selective, perhaps misleadingly so. Within the same interview Starmer also said he&rsquo;d encourage immigration for different types of jobs. He also acknowledged that we have a desperate need for more NHS staff. But his proposed solution was that the UK needs to do way more in terms of increasing training opportunities and making jobs in the NHS bearable enough that any sane person isn&rsquo;t so deterred by the conditions that they wouldn&rsquo;t want the training in the first place.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m fully on board with that as a plank of the approach. It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. But it&rsquo;s not an either/or situation. We have a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-staff-crisis-20000-doctors-28417859\">NHS staffing crisis</a> right now. Earlier this year it was calculated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/staffing-crisis-deepens-in-nhs-england-with-110000-posts-unfilled\">around 110,000 NHS vacancies were unfilled</a>. A British politician with the wellbeing of their constituents in mind should use whatever reasonable means we have to solve it.</p>\n<p>Starmer is not known to be a naïve or stupid politician so when he said &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d have understood how that might sound.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s particularly gruelling about this example is that reducing the immigration of medical workers isn&rsquo;t even a popular policy. In the latest poll I can find, most people are actively in favour of immigration in terms of increasing the supply of doctors and nurses in the UK.</p>\n<p>From page 15 of <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Shifting-Views-Report-Oct-2022-FINAL.pdf\">the British Future report</a> on attitudes to immigration this year:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>55% of respondents to this survey commissioned from IPSOS, designed to be representative of the British pouplation,  would prefer recruitment of migrants as nurses to increase, with only 13% against. The figures for doctors are very similar.</p>\n<p>Even most <em>Conservative party supporters</em> are in favour!

				"content_text": "Things like [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167) are exactly what cause me [angst about joining the Labour party](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html). \r\n\r\nTo be fair the headline \"_Keir Starmer: Too many people from overseas recruited to NHS_\" is a little selective, perhaps misleadingly so. Within the same interview Starmer also said he'd encourage immigration for different types of jobs. He also acknowledged that we have a desperate need for more NHS staff. But his proposed solution was that the UK needs to do way more in terms of increasing training opportunities and making jobs in the NHS bearable enough that any sane person isn't so deterred by the conditions that they wouldn't want the training in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'm fully on board with that as a plank of the approach. It's absolutely necessary. But it's not an either/or situation. We have a [NHS staffing crisis](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-staff-crisis-20000-doctors-28417859) right now. Earlier this year it was calculated that [around 110,000 NHS vacancies were unfilled](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/staffing-crisis-deepens-in-nhs-england-with-110000-posts-unfilled). A British politician with the wellbeing of their constituents in mind should use whatever reasonable means we have to solve it.\r\n\r\nStarmer is not known to be a naïve or stupid politician so when he said \"I think we're recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service\" I'm sure he'd have understood how that might sound.\r\n\r\nWhat's particularly gruelling about this example is that reducing the immigration of medical workers isn't even a popular policy. In the latest poll I can find, most people are actively in favour of immigration in terms of increasing the supply of doctors and nurses in the UK.\r\n\r\nFrom page 15 of [the British Future report](https://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Shifting-Views-Report-Oct-2022-FINAL.pdf) on attitudes to immigration this year:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/9308786c51.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n55% of respondents to this survey commissioned from IPSOS, designed to be representative of the British pouplation,  would prefer recruitment of migrants as nurses to increase, with only 13% against. The figures for doctors are very similar. \r\n\r\nEven most *Conservative party supporters* are in favour! Compared to Labour supporters they're more likely to say the numbers should be reduced, but only by a few percentage points.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/02a33840de.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"506\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nOf course this might not be apparent in the public discourse. Inevitably there is a certain percentage of the population who would rather see the immigration numbers go down than sustain the NHS. They're loudly represented on social media, likely encouraged by the recent Conservative tendency to seemingly try and recreate a US-style [culture war](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-tories-plan-assault-woke-culture-war/) to our shores.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that what job you do necessarily should be the basis of your ability to immigrate to the UK - I believe it *shouldn't* be.

That translates to \"Various historians of the Northern Germans and of neighbouring peoples\". \r\n\r\nA copy of that book was [returned to Sidney Sussex College 288 years after](https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/worlds-most-overdue-library-book) it had been borrowed in the year 1668. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/5771f61280.jpg\" width=\"385\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nThis one had been borrowed by [Colonel Robert Walpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole_(colonel)), who was an MP in 1689, and the father of the confusingly similar named [Sir Robert Walpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole), who Wikipedia records as being the first [Prime Minister of the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom).\r\n\r\nIn that case no fine was exacted.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around <a href=\"https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html\">850k people</a> being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million.</p>\n<p>For years I&rsquo;ve felt uneasy about so directly supporting a party when all of them usually have some policy or other I firmly disagree with, especially without feeling like I&rsquo;ve had enough resources at hand to work towards enacting change from within.</p>\n<p>In more recent times I&rsquo;ve also not felt I&rsquo;ve understood what any of the parties not in currently in power even really stand for. I&rsquo;ve ended up voting for various left-leaning parties over the years depending on the situation at the time.</p>\n<p>However, in the present time of a truly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism\">dangerous</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began\">chaotic</a> government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them. If <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-poll-lead-tory-wipeout_uk_634d98a6e4b0b7f89f59852c\">recent polling</a> carried forth into actual votes they&rsquo;d in fact have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory\">landslide victory</a></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t love <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/\">the Labour website</a>. The first thing you see is a form requesting your contact details on top of a somewhat nausea-inducing background video sequence. Then, inevitably, a cookies popup that as far as I can see you can&rsquo;t actually <em>decline</em>, along with a donation popup.</p>\n<p>But get through all of that and there&rsquo;s a link to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/\">Labour&rsquo;s vision for Britain</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>It looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I&rsquo;m <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/\">not convinced</a> that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0\">up to a point</a>.</p>\n<p>As to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy.</p>\n<p>At a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I&rsquo;m nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there&rsquo;s an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there&rsquo;s any evidence to back it up.</p>\n<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;we want more fair and good green jobs&rdquo;- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it&rsquo;s a reasonable vision to have.</p>\n<p>In former days it&rsquo;d be one of those annoying generic slogans that it&rsquo;s hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/\">the opposite</a>. At times the Conservatives seem <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637\">desperate to inject culture-war topics</a> into the UK political sphere which isn&rsquo;t going to help on anything environmental.</p>\n<p>What other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/\">campaigns page</a>. Here&rsquo;s roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.</p>\n<h3 id=\"employment\">Employment</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost people&rsquo;s income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.</li>\n<li>Ban zero hours contracts and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; self-employment.</li>\n<li>End the &ldquo;qualifying periods&rdquo; some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave.</li>\n<li>Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"energy\">Energy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.</li>\n<li>Ensure people who have prepayment meters don&rsquo;t pay more for energy than everyone else.</li>\n<li>Insulate all homes that need it.</li>\n<li>Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.</li>\n<li>Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"economy\">Economy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Build industries in every region of the UK.</li>\n<li>Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.</li>\n<li>Create a national wealth fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"security\">Security</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing</li>\n<li>Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.</li>\n<li>Introduce rules on strip-searching children.</li>\n<li>Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.</li>\n<li>Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"health\">Health</h3>\n<p>Expand the NHS workforce by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year.</li>\n<li>creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year.</li>\n<li>training 5000 new health visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"education\">Education</h3>\n<p>Primary school education: &ldquo;Build a Britain where children come first&rdquo; - this one was extremely vague.</p>\n<h3 id=\"home-ownership\">Home ownership</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Target 70% home ownership.</li>\n<li>Build high quality affordable homes</li>\n<li>Reform the private rented sector</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"some-of-the-things-i-liked-in-what-i-saw\">Some of the things I liked in what I saw:</h2>\n<p>An emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701\">to make use of food banks</a>, need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd.</p>\n<p>Banning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don&rsquo;t know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they&rsquo;re right to identify that, surprise surprise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts\">that&rsquo;s not what actually happens at present</a> so it might be a good policy in net terms.</p>\n<p>The green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first.

				"content_text": "I'm not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around [850k people](https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html) being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million. \r\n\r\nFor years I've felt uneasy about so directly supporting a party when all of them usually have some policy or other I firmly disagree with, especially without feeling like I've had enough resources at hand to work towards enacting change from within. \r\n\r\nIn more recent times I've also not felt I've understood what any of the parties not in currently in power even really stand for. I've ended up voting for various left-leaning parties over the years depending on the situation at the time. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the present time of a truly [dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism) and [chaotic](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began) government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them. If [recent polling](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-poll-lead-tory-wipeout_uk_634d98a6e4b0b7f89f59852c) carried forth into actual votes they'd in fact have a [landslide victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't love [the Labour website](https://labour.org.uk/). The first thing you see is a form requesting your contact details on top of a somewhat nausea-inducing background video sequence. Then, inevitably, a cookies popup that as far as I can see you can't actually *decline*, along with a donation popup. \r\n\r\nBut get through all of that and there's a link to \"[Labour's vision for Britain](https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/)\". \r\n\r\nIt looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I'm [not convinced](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/) that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only [up to a point](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0).\r\n\r\nAs to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy. \r\n\r\nAt a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I'm nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there's an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there's any evidence to back it up.\r\n\r\nObviously it's easy to say \"we want more fair and good green jobs\"- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it's a reasonable vision to have. \r\n\r\nIn former days it'd be one of those annoying generic slogans that it's hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn't seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite [the opposite](https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/). At times the Conservatives seem [desperate to inject culture-war topics](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637) into the UK political sphere which isn't going to help on anything environmental.\r\n\r\nWhat other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their [campaigns page](https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/). Here's roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.\r\n\r\n### Employment\r\n- Boost people's income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.\r\n- Ban zero hours contracts and \"bogus\" self-employment. \r\n- End the \"qualifying periods\" some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave. \r\n- Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Energy\r\n- Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.\r\n- Ensure people who have prepayment meters don't pay more for energy than everyone else.\r\n- Insulate all homes that need it.\r\n- Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.\r\n- Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.\r\n\r\n### Economy\r\n- Build industries in every region of the UK.\r\n- Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.\r\n- Create a national wealth fund.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing\r\n- Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.\r\n- Introduce rules on strip-searching children.\r\n- Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.\r\n- Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people. \r\n\r\n### Health\r\nExpand the NHS workforce by:\r\n\r\n- doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year. \r\n- creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year. \r\n- training 5000 new health visitors. \r\n\r\n### Education\r\nPrimary school education: \"Build a Britain where children come first\" - this one was extremely vague. \r\n\r\n### Home ownership\r\n- Target 70% home ownership.\r\n- Build high quality affordable homes\r\n- Reform the private rented sector\r\n\r\n## Some of the things I liked in what I saw:\r\n\r\nAn emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing [to make use of food banks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701), need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd. \r\n\r\nBanning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don't know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they're right to identify that, surprise surprise, [that's not what actually happens at present](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts) so it might be a good policy in net terms.\r\n\r\nThe green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first. Actually it [already is doing so](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns). Mitigating climate change should be a priority for every party, particularly as we already know a lot of what needs to be done - it's a case of actually *doing* it.\r\n\r\nExpanding the NHS workforce, assuming this comes with investment. After the Covid pandemic and chronic mismanagement on the part of the Conservatives, the NHS is in a quite precarious state with huge waiting lists to catch up on - including 6 million people [waiting to start hospital treatment](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high). Whether this expansion can happen fast enough to be the only major change needed I don't know - I would assume not - but it's clearly a necessary step for the future.\r\n\r\nA focus on domestic abuse and other violence against women, areas of crime that are unfortunately common and also very rarely prosecuted in many cases.\r\n\r\nCreating of a publicly owned energy company - to facilitate the shift towards green energy, but also to create jobs, reduce dependence on countries such as Russia, build resilience and in the end lower fuel bills. I'm happy Labour aren't scared to introduce policies that might be seen as being at least in the *direction* of nationalising parts of some critical industries, even if they have gone out of their way [to make it clear](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/great-british-energy-what-is-it-what-would-it-do-and-how-would-it-be-funded) that we're not talking about nationalising existing companies.\r\n\r\nTaxing the vast profits of fossil fuel energy providers. This might prove somewhat impossible many cases when a lot of them are not British-situated companies. For those that are within the appropriate jurisdiction then it seems right to me to windfall-tax the profits of the energy producers which [have been incredible](https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/oil-companies-massive-profits-first-quarter-russia-ukraine/) at a time when the cost of energy to consumers has created a real crisis.\r\n\r\nReforming the private rental sector - rents [have never been higher](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/21/private-rents-britain-hit-record-high-demand-properties).

				"title": "Yet more ramblings about AI generated art",
				"content_html": "<p>Ever since learning about the prevalence and progress of AI-generated art, mainly via such a piece having <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed\">won an art competition</a>, it&rsquo;s not left my mind for too long.  I was <a href=\"https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/should-artificial-intelligences-win-art-competitions/\">kind of confused</a> how best to think about it then, and it&rsquo;s only got worse as time goes on. Herein are some further ramblings.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, these are systems where you type in a prompt, e.g. &ldquo;Picture of a juggling elephant&rdquo; and out pops a picture of whatever you asked for. Right now the results aren&rsquo;t always great, hence the new vocation of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/\">prompt engineer</a>&rdquo; - someone who knows what phrases to give to an AI for best result. But they&rsquo;re often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond.</p>\n<p>There exist several famous such systems, including <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALL-E</a>, <a href=\"https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release\">Stable Diffusion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/\">Midjourney</a>. Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it&rsquo;s derived from all the art and contextual information it&rsquo;s already seen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists\">This Guardian article</a> gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details.\n<code>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CIpzeNxIhU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</code></p>\n<p>Given the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable that we&rsquo;ll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it&rsquo;s often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism&rsquo;s invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You&rsquo;d basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>\n<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it&rsquo;s going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it&rsquo;ll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.</p>\n<p>After all, even if it turns out that the very &lsquo;best&rsquo; art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there&rsquo;s a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it&rsquo;s extremely cheap to produce.</p>\n<p>Automation replacing people in jobs is very much <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/\">not new</a>, but it&rsquo;s traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t plenty of unpleasant, tedious, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/\">ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs</a>. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.</p>\n<p>Whilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that&rsquo;s inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://designer.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Designer</a>&rdquo; component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing &ldquo;Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall&rdquo;, no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.</p>\n<p><code>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/smvyxABRZTU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</code></p>\n<p>Stock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that <a href=\"(https://www.stockai.com/)\">offer to generate you an AI-created image</a> if they don&rsquo;t already have something that meets your satisfaction. That&rsquo;s one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image\">dedicated tools</a> reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I&rsquo;m done.</p>\n<p>Update: I did just that. Here&rsquo;s the image <a href=\"https://www.stockai.com/\">stockai.com</a> generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>That&rsquo;s an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There&rsquo;s no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not <em>directly</em>, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don&rsquo;t need to into their heads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/\">The Atlantic</a> magazine already got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists\">some controversy</a> over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/\">The Economist</a> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover\">used an AI</a> to design one of its covers. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let&rsquo;s also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you <em>read</em> in certain publications are written by AIs - the <a href=\"https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/\">automated journalism</a> trend, so it&rsquo;s not only visual creativity at play here.</p>\n<p>But worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite\">Luddites</a> who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn&rsquo;t win; they became an insult.</p>\n<p>Sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it, they&rsquo;ll just get better jobs right away&rdquo; or &ldquo;but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end&rdquo; abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn&rsquo;t, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. But <em>in theory</em> we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.</p>\n<p>What is less obvious to me is what a shift to most &ldquo;art&rdquo; we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are &ldquo;new&rdquo; for sure, in that they never existed before. But they&rsquo;re all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven&rsquo;t previously been combined - such as &ldquo;Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049&rdquo;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In other, more abstract cases, it&rsquo;s much less obvious.</p>\n<p>But in any case, the machine needs feeding.</p>\n<p>One might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they&rsquo;ve seen. To what extent is a human&rsquo;s art also a black box &ldquo;generative process&rdquo; based on all the artistic inputs they&rsquo;ve seen in their life? There&rsquo;s an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement\">movements</a>&rdquo; exist in art - think <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism\">Impressionism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism\">Modernism</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism\">Neo-Classicism</a>, that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>But something starts those movements. What I don&rsquo;t know is whether that&rsquo;s something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn&rsquo;t deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>But if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like &ldquo;optimise your output to please the most amount of people today&rdquo; then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense?</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s of course possible I&rsquo;ve gotten this the wrong way round. An <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/\">AI playing the game of Go</a> beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they&rsquo;ve been described as &lsquo;alien&rsquo; and &lsquo;from an alternate dimension&rsquo;. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we&rsquo;d never otherwise have imagined.</p>\n<p>Perhaps some of the more concerning &ldquo;getting stuck&rdquo; effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html\">changed its once acclaimed artistic output</a> based on what it&rsquo;s algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet\">eating out of toilets</a> because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how &ldquo;new&rdquo; this is; I&rsquo;m sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It&rsquo;s much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo;. That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes.</p>\n<p>A little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don&rsquo;t have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I&rsquo;m not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people&rsquo;s art, a whole set of rights issues exist.</p>\n<p>Being popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski\">Greg Rutkowski</a>  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\">become a common prompt</a> for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\">example shown by the MIT Technology Review</a> used the prompt <em>“Wizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski&quot;</em> which produced this:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn&rsquo;t his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images.

				"content_text": "Ever since learning about the prevalence and progress of AI-generated art, mainly via such a piece having [won an art competition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed), it's not left my mind for too long.  I was [kind of confused](https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/should-artificial-intelligences-win-art-competitions/) how best to think about it then, and it's only got worse as time goes on. Herein are some further ramblings.\n\nAs a reminder, these are systems where you type in a prompt, e.g. \"Picture of a juggling elephant\" and out pops a picture of whatever you asked for. Right now the results aren't always great, hence the new vocation of \"[prompt engineer](https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/)\" - someone who knows what phrases to give to an AI for best result. But they're often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond. \n\nThere exist several famous such systems, including [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it's derived from all the art and contextual information it's already seen.\n\n[This Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists) gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details. \n```{{< youtube 1CIpzeNxIhU >}}```\n\nGiven the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it's inevitable that we'll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it's often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism's invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You'd basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn't going to happen.\n\nPerhaps there'll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it's going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it'll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.\n\nAfter all, even if it turns out that the very 'best' art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there's a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it's extremely cheap to produce.\n\nAutomation replacing people in jobs is very much [not new](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/), but it's traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That's not to say there aren't plenty of unpleasant, tedious, [ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/). Maybe it won't be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being \"artistic\" is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.\n\nWhilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that's inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a \"[Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/)\" component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing \"Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall\", no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.\n\n```{{< youtube smvyxABRZTU >}}```\n\nStock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that [offer to generate you an AI-created image]((https://www.stockai.com/)) if they don't already have something that meets your satisfaction. That's one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site's [dedicated tools](https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image) reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I'm done.\n\nUpdate: I did just that. Here's the image [stockai.com](https://www.stockai.com/) generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/e41759a8f6.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThat's an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There's no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not *directly*, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don't need to into their heads. \n\n[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) magazine already got into [some controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists) over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) [used an AI](https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover) to design one of its covers. I'm sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let's also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you *read* in certain publications are written by AIs - the [automated journalism](https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/) trend, so it's not only visual creativity at play here.\n\nBut worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn't win; they became an insult. \n\nSentiments along the lines of \"don't worry about it, they'll just get better jobs right away\" or \"but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end\" abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn't, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). But *in theory* we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.\n\nWhat is less obvious to me is what a shift to most \"art\" we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are \"new\" for sure, in that they never existed before. But they're all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven't previously been combined - such as \"Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049\"\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“A still of Kermit The Frog in Blade Runner 2049 (2017)” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dalle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#dalle</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CxyWFRJETc\">pic.twitter.com/CxyWFRJETc</a></p>&mdash; HeavensLastAngel (@HvnsLstAngel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HvnsLstAngel/status/1531506455714492416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nIn other, more abstract cases, it's much less obvious. \n\nBut in any case, the machine needs feeding.\n\nOne might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they've seen. To what extent is a human's art also a black box \"generative process\" based on all the artistic inputs they've seen in their life? There's an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given \"[movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement)\" exist in art - think [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism), [Modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism), [Neo-Classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism), that kind of thing.\n\nBut something starts those movements. What I don't know is whether that's something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn't deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven't actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.\n\nBut if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like \"optimise your output to please the most amount of people today\" then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense? \n\nIt's of course possible I've gotten this the wrong way round. An [AI playing the game of Go](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/) beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they've been described as 'alien' and 'from an alternate dimension'. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we'd never otherwise have imagined.\n\nPerhaps some of the more concerning \"getting stuck\" effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has [changed its once acclaimed artistic output](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html) based on what it's algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people [eating out of toilets](https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet) because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral. \n\nIt's not clear how \"new\" this is; I'm sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It's much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off. \n\nIt's often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn't mean that it's \"better\". That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes. \n\nA little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don't have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I'm not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people's art, a whole set of rights issues exist.\n\nBeing popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. [Greg Rutkowski](https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski)  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently [become a common prompt](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/) for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name. \n\nAn [example shown by the MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/) used the prompt *“Wizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski\"* which produced this:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/960bd94de6.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\n\nNow when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn't his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images. So if some entity wants to use some work that an AI explicitly created   based on having ingested hundreds of his images without permission then they're presumably free to do so. This has understandably [left him with the opinion](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352) that \"A.I. should exclude living artists from its database\".  Which prompts me to additionally wonder about if there's any ethical considerations of note surrounding the possible AI exploitation of a *dead* artist's work.\n\nFor now though, if the artist's images are on the internet then they're considered fair game. These systems don't ask artists to opt in to having their work included, and it's not clear that they even have the ability to opt out them. Some tools that at might at least let you know if your work has been used to train these AI systems have started to appear, including [Spawn's Have I Been Trained?](https://haveibeentrained.com/). \n\nTo what extent this is different from a human artist enjoying Rutkowski's pictures and later creating something in a similar style is something that perhaps still needs to be thrashed out. After all, the ingested pictures were on the publicly accessible internet in the first place. But the big difference here is of course accessibility and scale. The new part is that is that a single person or business with no art knowledge or skill can generate hundreds of \"original\" Rutkowski style pictures a day with no artistic ability and little-to-no resources. \n\nThis opens up new possibilities for the masses, which could be a positive thing - see [the optimistic possibility Wired presents](https://www.wired.com/story/when-ai-makes-art/) of \"dramatically expanding the number of people able to generate and experiment with art and illustration\". But left without consideration, it may also result in a pretty devastating exploitation of people's hitherto highly valued work. And potentially a world where it feels like we're immersed in some kind of [Borges' style Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) but for whichever genre of art is algorithmically popular or convenient, with a possible plot twist of any remaining human artists [being accused of being AIs](https://twitter.com/OnTheGranblue/status/1578632039326441472).\n",

				"title": "If Disney did ruin The Little Mermaid then it was 33 years ago",
				"content_html": "<p>Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film &ldquo;The Little Mermaid&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-wPm99PF9U\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>Of course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. As noted in a <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid\">recent edition</a> of <a href=\"https://www.readtpa.com/\">The Present Age&rsquo;s </a>newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don&rsquo;t like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising, not least because the <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8\">same rants and raves happened</a> upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they&rsquo;d already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of &ldquo;using AI&rdquo; to <a href=\"https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/\">convert a still from the trailer</a> from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, &ldquo;over for wokecels.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/\">Fear of a Black Hobbit</a>&rdquo; is right in saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;can you make a film that isn&rsquo;t <em>about</em> politics?&rdquo; - of course you can. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine many films that aren&rsquo;t touched by society and politics one way or another.</p>\n<p>If what is really meant is &ldquo;I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago&rdquo; then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can&rsquo;t be interpreted &ldquo;politically&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it.</p>\n<p>If one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus\">Jesus has been portrayed</a> over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‘correct’ one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus\">they likely did exist</a> as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.</p>\n<p>On which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid&rsquo;s casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I&rsquo;m sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We&rsquo;re not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the colour of Ariel&rsquo;s skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It&rsquo;s more about whether she has a fish tail or not.</p>\n<p>Where skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you’re trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible. Switching the races of the actors in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/\">BlackkKlansman</a> would be pretty nonsensical given its topic and basis in real life. The story of a fictional creature living in a fictional world where their salient experience is dependent on whether they have a fish tail or human legs does not have this limiting factor.</p>\n<p>In reality, even a writer who wants to tell stories about race has many degrees of freedom. Science fiction for example contains many stories about social prejudice and discrimination paralleling racism but set in an entirely different looking and behaving world populated with distant aliens.  Experimenting with other identities can work similarly - Naomi Alderman&rsquo;s famous book &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power\">The Power</a>&rdquo; explores a future where women become a physical threat to men, as opposed to the current world where the opposite is usually true.</p>\n<p>Next up, well, Black mermaids are nothing new even within the canon of Disney-specific Little Mermaid productions. Disney has had them for three decades. You&rsquo;ve somewhat missed the boat on umm&hellip;&ldquo;proving&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n<p>Introducing Gabriella, from 1992&rsquo;s Disney&rsquo;s Little Mermaid TV series:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/uploads/2022/65b44cb50a.png\"\n         alt=\"Image from the Mermaid Wiki\"/><figcaption>\n            <p>Image from the <a href=\"https://mermaid.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella\">Mermaid Wiki</a></p>\n        </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Unlike most Disney mermaids, Gabriella was actually based on a real person, albeit not one with a tail.  Her design was inspired by 2 year-old Gabriella Bommino who unfortunately died of leukaemia so young, but was already a Little Mermaid superfan.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t if this choice caused any consternation in 1992 to be honest. I hope not. But Twitter and YouTube weren&rsquo;t a thing back then so perhaps it was more containable if it existed at all.</p>\n<p>Moving on: is there really a danger of ruining the purity (?) of the Little Mermaid by &ldquo;introducing politics&rdquo;? As noted above, so many - perhaps all - stories are already touched or contextualised by politics and society.

				"content_text": "Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film \"The Little Mermaid\".\n\n{{< youtube 0-wPm99PF9U >}}\n\nOf course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being \"too woke\". As noted in a [recent edition](https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid) of [The Present Age's ](https://www.readtpa.com/)newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don't like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.\n\nThis isn't surprising, not least because the [same rants and raves happened](https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8) upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn't seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they'd already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.\n\nPerhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of \"using AI\" to [convert a still from the trailer](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/) from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to \"fix\" the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, \"over for wokecels.\"\n\nTrying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article \"[Fear of a Black Hobbit](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/)\" is right in saying:\n\n> The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.\n\nTo what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don't mean \"can you make a film that isn't *about* politics?\" - of course you can. But it's hard for me to imagine many films that aren't touched by society and politics one way or another. \n\nIf what is really meant is \"I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago\" then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can't be interpreted \"politically\" then there's still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it. \n\nIf one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that [Jesus has been portrayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus) over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‘correct’ one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that [they likely did exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus) as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.\n\nOn which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid's casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I'm sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We're not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.\n\nSecondly, the colour of Ariel's skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It's more about whether she has a fish tail or not. \n\nWhere skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you’re trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible. Switching the races of the actors in [BlackkKlansman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/) would be pretty nonsensical given its topic and basis in real life. The story of a fictional creature living in a fictional world where their salient experience is dependent on whether they have a fish tail or human legs does not have this limiting factor.\n\nIn reality, even a writer who wants to tell stories about race has many degrees of freedom. Science fiction for example contains many stories about social prejudice and discrimination paralleling racism but set in an entirely different looking and behaving world populated with distant aliens.  Experimenting with other identities can work similarly - Naomi Alderman's famous book \"[The Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power)\" explores a future where women become a physical threat to men, as opposed to the current world where the opposite is usually true. \n\nNext up, well, Black mermaids are nothing new even within the canon of Disney-specific Little Mermaid productions. Disney has had them for three decades. You've somewhat missed the boat on umm...\"proving\" they don't exist.\n\nIntroducing Gabriella, from 1992's Disney's Little Mermaid TV series:\n\n{{< figure src=\"/uploads/2022/65b44cb50a.png\" caption=\"Image from the [Mermaid Wiki](https://mermaid.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella)\" >}}\n\nUnlike most Disney mermaids, Gabriella was actually based on a real person, albeit not one with a tail.  Her design was inspired by 2 year-old Gabriella Bommino who unfortunately died of leukaemia so young, but was already a Little Mermaid superfan.\n\nI don't if this choice caused any consternation in 1992 to be honest. I hope not. But Twitter and YouTube weren't a thing back then so perhaps it was more containable if it existed at all.\n\nMoving on: is there really a danger of ruining the purity (?) of the Little Mermaid by \"introducing politics\"? As noted above, so many - perhaps all - stories are already touched or contextualised by politics and society. But it seems to me that the Little Mermaid is particularly easy to interpret using political and social metaphors. Many people have done so, years before last week's trailer came out.\n\nWhilst some may now find aspects of Disney's original 1989 film interpretation of The Little Mermaid [problematic](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-little-mermaid_b_1694342), the [Smithsonian Magazine wrote](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/little-mermaid-was-way-more-subversive-you-realized-180973464/) in some detail about the political subversion embedded within it at the time.\n\n>The last thing Americans would expect from Disney was a critique of patriarchy, but sure enough, Ashman’s _The Little Mermaid_ is a gutsy film about gender and identity—a far cry from the staid Disney catalog.\n\nLenika Cruz [writing in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/the-little-mermaid-at-25-and-the-evolving-definition-of-strong-female/382581/) saw it as a \"stepping stone\" for Disney from a set of animations with few female leads (and those that did feature were often asleep for most of the film - think Snow White or Sleeping Beauty) to the more rounded, well-developed female cartoon stars of recent years.\n\nMore fundamentally, there has been many an interpretation of the original story, for example as an allegory for growing up, as a commentary on identity or a metaphor for gender relations.

The way it works over here is that the government issues a cap, which limits the maximum amount the energy supply companies can charge consumers.

Or at least not an overall one. You will always pay more if you use more electricity. The quoted cap is on the cost it would be for an average consumer. This translates down to a cap on the standing cost and unit price. If you have a big or energy inefficient house you may well pay substantially more than £2,500.

So most of the levers we can pull at an individual level are about cutting down on the usage of electricity.

Whilst I can find that the appliance is overall energy rating B, I can&rsquo;t quickly figure out how to know what that means specifically for the dryer component in watts. I&rsquo;d say it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete.\nThe Bloomberg chart above suggested £1.95 per load.

The brain induces a deprivation mindset, and we feel less satiated, more hungry and inclined to expend less energy in order to preserve fat stores.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s known that appetite is controlled in part by activity in the digestive system - bottom-up information. However the brain also seems to need top-down info e.g. memory and expectation, to make sense of the digestive information input in order to create the appropriate feelings of hunger or satiation.</p>\n<p>Altering how we think about food can change the brain&rsquo;s assessment of what it has eaten.</p>\n<h2 id=\"memory\">Memory</h2>\n<p>A patient who had lost the ability to form new memories, was asked to rate how hungry he was on a scale of 0 -100. He rated his hunger similarly both before and after consuming a meal.  After two meals in a row he felt only partly satiated.</p>\n<p>This suggests that our appetite is not solely governed by &ldquo;fullness signals&rdquo; from the stomach. It&rsquo;s also influenced by our memory of what we ate.</p>\n<p>Milder forgetfulness is also associated with over-eating.</p>\n<p>In an experiment asking students to taste test cookies, they consumed 45% less if they had first been prompted to remember their lunch by noting down what they&rsquo;d eaten.</p>\n<p>Working, watching TV or using the internet whilst eating may create a distraction that impairs our memory of what we ate, leading to eating larger meals and more snacks afterwards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expectation\">Expectation</h2>\n<p>The sense of fullness and satisfaction participants had from eating either 300ml or 500ml of soup was largely based on how much soup they thought they&rsquo;d eaten, rather than how much they actually had.</p>\n<p>Participants who believed they&rsquo;d eaten a 3 egg omelette felt more satiated than those who thought they&rsquo;d eaten a 1 egg omelette, even though they&rsquo;d eaten the same amount.</p>\n<p>Patients who believed that they&rsquo;ve undergone obesity-related surgery, e.g. stomach stapling or gastric balloon, experienced 70% of the benefits of the operation (reduced appetite, higher weightloss) even though the actual surgery never took place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"presentation\">Presentation</h3>\n<p>The presentation of manufactured foods can disrupt our brain&rsquo;s ability to assess its contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The brain remembers eating a lot less after drinking a small bottled smoothie vs eating the equivalent portions of fruit, giving the expectation of hunger later in the day.</li>\n<li>Several studies show that the exact same food leads to lower satiety when it is labelled &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as opposed to when it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;hearty&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The more viscous a drink is the more filling we expect it to be, and the higher our physiological response.</li>\n<li>Iron absorption from meals that have been pureed were much lower than the same meal presented in its standard form.</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; snacks may be counterproductive - participants given a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; chocolate bar were hungrier afterwards than those given nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"beliefs\">Beliefs</h3>\n<p>When presented with a choice of 2 items such as a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger and a 8.5oz grilled ocean code, most people think the burger has more calories even though they&rsquo;re about equal, over or underestimating the true value by up to 50%.

				"content_text": "Yesterday a friend sent me this absolute horror show of a temperature forecast map for the UK.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/78290fb40c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"730\" alt=\"\" />\n\nIt's already been hot a while, but seemingly next Monday and Tuesday are going to feel _extra_ unlivable for us in the UK, where it's not very common for people to have air con or many other anti-being-too-hot facilities. \n\nThe [MET has issued](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/12/uk-weather-amber-warning-for-extreme-heat-extended-into-next-week) an extreme heat warning. The [NHS is trying to brace itself](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/14/uk-heatwave-nhs-braced-as-minister-says-temperatures-could-hit-40c) for yet more health emergencies in amongst all the [ongoing Covid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/10/theres-a-feeling-of-powerlessness-uk-healthcare-workers-on-rising-covid-numbers). \n\nThis kind of heat can in particular be dangerous to older people with certain medical conditions, so there's lots of good advice out there about checking on your potentially vulnerable neighbours. But if it gets hot enough that a [level 4 heatwave alert](https://www.itv.com/news/2022-07-12/what-is-a-level-4-heat-health-warning-and-could-there-be-a-national-emergency) is issued for the first time ever, then then even the risk-factor-free population may suffer harm if precautions are not taken. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/a4992b8b2d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" alt=\"\" />\n\nSome of the potential side-effects of this type of excessive heat can include:\n\n- Road surfaces and pavements melting, as [happened in previous heatwaves](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/roads-melt-and-rail-tracks-buckle-as-uk-heatwave-strikes-27-06-2018/).\n- Railway lines buckling. Railway lines can get to be [20 degrees hotter](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/buckled-rail-and-summer-heat/) than the air temperature. At a certain temperature, [restrictions](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/speed-restrictions/) are placed on the speed of trains.\n- Electricity supply problems - both because there's an increase in demand for energy, and the heat reduces how much power the system can carry. Plus power stations get less efficient. It's possible that certain designs of nuclear power reactors [have to shut down](https://www.climateforesight.eu/articles/nuclear-power-feeling-the-heat/) because the water used to cool them gets too warm, although so far that's never happened in the UK.\n- Water shortages, due to excessive demand.\n- Wildfires starting.\n- Smell, dust, infestations.\n- Reduced crop harvests.\n\nBasically a lot of stuff that in extremis sounds a little dystopian. But it is 2022, so I wouldn't rule any of it out.\n\nThere’s an estimated 30% chance that next week will in fact beat the current UK highest ever temperature on record, which was [38.7 degrees Celsius](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c) in July 2019. \n\nNew temperature records - and the associated death and destruction - might not be rare in the future though if we don't finally find a way to reduce humanity's damage to the environment. A [study from a couple of years back](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16834-0#Sec10) estimated that temperatures about 40 degrees would be seen every 3-4 years in the UK by the end of the century if we don't do something to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

				"title": "Coffee, Caffeine and Health - a summary of the paper by van Dam et al.",
				"content_html": "<p>I was recently searching for information as to in which ways coffee might be bad for one&rsquo;s health, even when drunk in moderation. I was considering giving it up if there were thought to be any significant negative health effects I&rsquo;d rather do without.</p>\n<p>One of the most comprehensive-looking papers I chanced upon in my endeavors was <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1816604\">Coffee, Caffeine and Health</a> by van Dam et al in the New England Journal of Medicine. Below then are my summary notes of what I gleaned from it. All credit of course should go to researchers, and all mistakes in summarising are my own.</p>\n<p>It turns out that I did not find anything that suggested much benefit in giving up my up-to-1-cup-a-day of coffee habit. In fact I was somewhat surprised to see that there are thought to be associations between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and positive health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Another couple of links I noted that referred to some of the same data for anyone not in the mood for reading the paper itself are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/\">Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html\">Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"brief-summary\">Brief summary:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn&rsquo;t warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety.

				"content_text": "I was recently searching for information as to in which ways coffee might be bad for one's health, even when drunk in moderation. I was considering giving it up if there were thought to be any significant negative health effects I'd rather do without. \r\n\r\nOne of the most comprehensive-looking papers I chanced upon in my endeavors was [Coffee, Caffeine and Health](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1816604) by van Dam et al in the New England Journal of Medicine. Below then are my summary notes of what I gleaned from it. All credit of course should go to researchers, and all mistakes in summarising are my own.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that I did not find anything that suggested much benefit in giving up my up-to-1-cup-a-day of coffee habit. In fact I was somewhat surprised to see that there are thought to be associations between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and positive health outcomes.\r\n\r\nAnother couple of links I noted that referred to some of the same data for anyone not in the mood for reading the paper itself are:\r\n\r\n- [Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/)\r\n- [Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html)\r\n\r\n## Brief summary:\r\n\r\n- Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn't warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.\r\n\r\n- However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety. A limit of 400mg of caffeine per day has been recommended for adults who are not pregnant or lactating, and 200mg for those who are pregnant/lactating.\r\n\r\n- Most, but not all, of the beneficial effects seem to be associated with decaffeinated coffee as well as caffeinated, so that is an option if sensitive to caffeine.\r\n\r\n- Caffeine can interfere with sleep, although this varies between people. Nontheless, drinking it late in the day may be unadvisable.\r\n\r\n- Unfiltered, and to some extent espresso, coffee have cholesterol-raising compounds so it may be better to limit consumption of those, but filtered or instant coffee does not have that effect.\r\n\r\n## In more detail:\r\n\r\nCoffee and tea are amongst the most popular beverages in the world, with their substantial caffeine content making caffeine the most widely used psychoactive agent.\r\n\r\nCaffeine content is typically highest in coffee, energy drinks and caffeine tablets, intermediate in tea and lowest in soft drinks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/69139/2022/42fffe7b6e.png\" width=\"421\" height=\"446\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nIn the US 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135mg a day (~1.5 standard cups of coffee). \r\n\r\nCoffee is the main source of caffeine for adults.
