			 <p>Looking at the various dictionaries' Word Of The Year 2023 winners - let&rsquo;s hope no good words come out in the next 10 days hey? - I see they&rsquo;ve been almost as distracted as I have by the robot brains.</p>
<p><a href="https://content.dictionary.com/word-of-the-year-2023/">Dictionary.com</a> focuses on a key limiting factor of today&rsquo;s automated chatters: their ability to <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">answer you with fiction</a>, indistinguishable from fact in its presentation. They go with &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo;. Which isn&rsquo;t a new word of course, but OK, it was really only this year that journalists, commentators, and everyone of a certain type who you follow on social media started to write en masse about computers having them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(of artificial intelligence) to produce false information contrary to the intent of the user and present it as if true and factual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/editorial/woty">Cambridge</a> goes for something similar. In fact something exactly the same: &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s definition now includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an artificial intelligence hallucinates, it produces false information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I love the way either definition is phrased, but they&rsquo;re the word experts I suppose.</p>
<p>Collins is on the same theme, but a bit more general. Their word of the year is &lsquo;AI&rsquo;. Which is actually an <em>abbreviation</em> for Artificial Intelligence, but no need to be picky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the modelling of human mental functions by computer programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have certainly successfully modelled the human mental function of not telling the truth, as confirmed twice above.</p>
<p><a href="https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2023/">Oxford</a> goes with something totally different, something for the youngsters: &lsquo;rizz&rsquo;. This word was new to me at least in 2023. Perhaps an abbreviation of charisma, it&rsquo;s a noun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>style, charm, or attractiveness, the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avid followers of bad things might remember a crossover technology featuring both rizz and the risk of hallucinations in the guise of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/18/somewhat-astonishing-that.html">rizzGPT</a>, which was to be a weird thing you put on your glasses that offers &ldquo;real-time Charisma as a Service (CaaS)&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year">Mirriam-Webster</a> goes with &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;. It has <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authentic">5 possible meanings</a> in their telling, none of which feel particularly new to this year. The first is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not false or imitation: real, actual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this choice feels a bit dated to me - didn&rsquo;t we go through a bout of authenticity a few years ago? -  maybe it&rsquo;s not so unrelated to the ones above; an antithesis to the other dictionaries' theses.</p>
<p>Mirriam-Webster thinks that the increase in interest of the definition of the word authentic is &ldquo;driven by stories and conversations about AI, celebrity culture, identity, and social media.&rdquo; - also known as conversations about hallucinations, AI and people trying to demonstrate their rizz.</p>

			 <p>Good news, it looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">federating</a> is still in fashion. Flipboard has <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-begins-to-federate/">starting federating</a> a few of its publisher&rsquo;s accounts via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>, and Threads seems to be actually following through on its initial promise - I&rsquo;m actually a little surprised - and is at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/meta-starts-testing-threads-integration-with-activitypub/">testing the feature</a>.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/meta-on-the-fediverse-thread-or-opportunity/">controversial</a> move to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metas-threads-could-make-or-break-the-fediverse/">some folk</a>, especially with regards to Threads. Personally I think it&rsquo;s a absolutely a good thing at least in theory. But it&rsquo;s surely not risk free. Undoubtedly one needs to do what one can to avoid any new federating instance successfully following the infamous path of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace, extend, extinguish strategy</a>.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1625455425">Stumpwork</a> by Dry Cleaning.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know I needed someone sardonically reading out what appears to be their unfiltered thoughtstream deadpan over a background of various guitar-and-rhythm styles in my life but it turns out I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oddly soothing. I guess knowing that other people have the same incessant, random, sort of dull monologue in their heads as they go about their day is reassuring. Kudos to these folks for making it into a real art form.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Brc0eLAxSG0?si=Y7vsnHH5YzQEIX2d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Everyone calls it post-punk, which I&rsquo;m not sure I fully know what means yet, but it&rsquo;s very good whatever it is. Think unrefined poetry being read out by someone who doesn&rsquo;t really care about it, but again, good.</p>
<p>Their first album, <a href="https://album.link/i/1549505079">New Long Leg</a>, also recommended, brought to my mind the idea of someone reading out their Facebook timeline, unfiltered, end-to-end, at times. This one feels more about over-sharing the constant array of often meaningless things that pop into one&rsquo;s mind in between a bit of tedious small-talk with neighbours. But again, in a very good way.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982155292">Zero Days</a> by Ruth Ware.</p>
<p>The book opens with Jacintha Cross sneaking around a corporate office, seemingly conducting some kind of heist. It turns out she&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration tester</a> so even if things did go wrong the consequences wouldn&rsquo;t be all that bad. Except today, when Gabe - her partner in both life and business - ends up in some real dire straits. And most people, the police included, seem to think she&rsquo;s to blame.</p>
<p>This felt like a fairly standard thriller, but its themes of hacking, social engineering and the like appeal to me, so I was fairly into it. There were some twists and turns to get excited about, although, despite not normally being great at doing, so I felt like I could see many of them coming substantially in advance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless it was compulsive enough to definitely need reading right to the end. Plus I felt like I learned a couple of techniques for confusing people into letting me into places I shouldn&rsquo;t really be in that, who knows, might come in handy one day.</p>

			 <p>Elon Musk tried to create a &lsquo;politically neutral&rsquo; - also known as &lsquo;politically conservative&rsquo; once we translate from Elon-speak -  AI called <a href="https://grok.x.ai/">Grok</a>, now available to folk who pay for Twitter.</p>
<p>But it turns out that even by training it on Twitter data [&ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t make it horrible enough to do anything but frustrate his fanboys who seem desperate to train hate into it. It&rsquo;s simply not &lsquo;<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1720660977786433810">based</a>&rsquo; enough to satisfy their unfortunate desires.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/12/10/elon-musks-grok-twitter-ai-is-actually-woke-hilarity-ensues/">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grok has said it would vote for Biden over Trump because of his views on social justice, climate change and healthcare. Grok has spoken eloquently about the need for diversity and inclusion in society</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does Grok think about one of Musk&rsquo;s favourite stupid turns of phrase- the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elon-musk-woke-mind-virus/">Woke Mind Virus</a>? Via <a href="https://x.com/edzitron/status/1733341212831269348?s=46&amp;t=24wZfzt3zl1mu8bjy58LJw">Ed Zitron</a>, the computer brain had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be real here, the &ldquo;woke mind virus&rdquo; is a load of BS. It&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s been used to dismiss and belittle important conversations about social justice and equality. It&rsquo;s a way for some to avoid confronting the uncomfortable truths about the world we live in and the work that needs to be done to make it a better place for everyone.</p>

			 <p>Maryam Moshiri falls victim to the same self-inflicted disaster that I&rsquo;m sure all of us remote office workers have at one time or another, except in this case her Zoom-style misdemeanors were being broadcast to&hellip;the entire world.</p>
<p>From my favourite edition of BBC News last week:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/07/bbc-presenter-apologises-after-giving-middle-finger-at-start-of-live-broadcast">The Guardian</a> takes the opportunity to re-hash some other BBC classics.  Here&rsquo;s weather-person Tomasz Schafernaker reacting to some light jibing from his colleagues with similarly bad timing:</p>

<p>There was the time when Guy Goma went for his job interview at the BBC but was somehow mistaken for IT expert Guy Kewney and ended up being interviewed on air. Give him maximum credit for bluffing his way through it:</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is surprising, but it&rsquo;s now &ldquo;official&rdquo; that because push notifications from iOS and Android all have to go via Apple and Google it means that those companies are in a position to know which users are getting which notifications. And thus also to provide that info to people that ask them for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the records that governments can obtain from Apple and Google include metadata that reveals which apps a person has used, when they’ve received notifications, and the phone associated with a particular Google or Apple account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several government agencies, both inside and outside of the US, have successfully requested this info. Apple claims that until Senator Wyden brought this topic up they were forbidden from sharing any information about their ability to do this, let alone how often it happened.</p>

<p>Rolling Stone isn&rsquo;t holding back in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/henry-kissinger-war-criminal-dead-1234804748/">their obituary</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Kissenger</a>, who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/henry-kissinger-dominant-us-diplomat-cold-war-era-dies-aged-100-2023-11-30/">died last week</a> at the age of 100.</p>
<p>As US national security advisor and secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Rolling Stone tells a story which situates the responsibility for the deaths of millions of people on Kissenger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always valuable to hear the reverent tones with which American elites speak of their monsters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One major part of this was his role in deliberately undermining the potential for an earlier agreement to finish the catastrophic Vietnam war, seemingly on the basis that it might make it harder for his preferred candidate to win the US presidency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single person who died in Vietnam between autumn 1968 and the Fall of Saigon — and all who died in Laos and Cambodia, where Nixon and Kissinger secretly expanded the war within months of taking office, as well as all who died in the aftermath, like the Cambodian genocide their destabilization set into motion — died because of Henry Kissinger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For it seems like power was Kissenger&rsquo;s primary motivation. Power for himself, for his President, and for America, at any cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point was American geopolitical dominance, something measured in impunity and achieved by any means necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is on track for a “hellish” 3C of global heating, the UN has warned.</p>

<p>Apparently our current efforts to combat global warming have us on track for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/20/world-facing-hellish-3c-of-climate-heating-un-warns-before-cop28">3 degree increase in global warming</a> by the end of the century.</p>
<p>I feel like the news is always the same, only the number of degrees increases point by point, in a very unreassuring manner. Which is fair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to assume next year&rsquo;s report lets us know that we&rsquo;re en-route to 3.5 degrees, and finds an adjective somehow even more unnerving than &ldquo;hellish&rdquo; to some up our future lives. Even achieving net zero by 2050 would still result in a 2 degree increase, a scenario that was described in rather doomy terms <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ipcc-climate-change-report-why-2-degree-warming-is-dangerous-2018-10">just a few years ago</a>.</p>

<p>I read and enjoyed &ldquo;Recursion&rdquo; by the same author <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/02/finished-reading-recursion.html">earlier this year</a>, so was enthusiastic to try this, his latest novel, out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in a somewhat dystopian but very recognisable world of the presumably near future. We haven&rsquo;t solved our environmental problems, in fact parts of Manhattan are unusably flooded amongst other such places.  But technology has advanced a bit, in particular our ability to edit genes.</p>
<p>Although gene editing was outlawed following a misguided attempt by top scientist Miriam Ramsay to enhance the resistance of rice to a particular blight. Best of intentions maybe, but there were of course unforeseen consequences which led to a mass starvation, hundreds of millions of deaths, and a ban on genetic engineering. Miriam killed herself.</p>
<p>The ban is enforced by the Genetic Protection Agency, where we find out protagonist, Logan Ramsay, working. Logan is Miriam&rsquo;s son, who seems to be working there more out of a sense of guilt for the impact his mother had on the world - he himself was involved enough to go to prison for a while - than a love for the job.</p>
<p>One day, a raid goes wrong and he&rsquo;s exposed to an unknown virus. The symptoms are agonising at first, but he recovers his health soon enough. And more besides. Suddenly he feels stronger, more intelligent, more sensitive, with a better memory. He can even beat his daughter at chess. Until, imprisoned for genetic self-engineering, he no longer has the opportunity to.</p>
<p>Then a figure from his past life turns up, also stronger, fitter and cleverer than either of them had suspected. The problem is that they strongly disagree what they should do about it. The potential consequences of the decision could hardly be higher.</p>
<p>To get to the bottom of that requires resolving several deep ethical problems. What risks do we have the right to take in the name of a potentially better future? And even what does it mean to be human? Not that you&rsquo;ll need an ethics PhD to understand the situation, honestly it&rsquo;s mostly an action thriller, substantially less intellectually demanding to me than the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/11/27/everyone-was-right.html">last work of fiction I read</a> was. But the conundrum is real, and adjacent to one that humanity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30742774">is already facing</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure how I felt about the end of the epilogue, but was fully engrossed throughout the main story.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780544947665">The Extended Mind</a> by Annie Murphy Paul.</p>
<p>This was one of those books that are so fascinating that when I attempt to highlight the interesting bits I find myself highlighting the whole book. I&rsquo;d heard good things about it and it certainly delivered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on a topic that&rsquo;s of great import and interest to me - essentially how to think &ldquo;better&rdquo;. It also share a thesis that wasn&rsquo;t entirely intuitive to me in a way that suggests some practical avenues one can easily change one&rsquo;s behaviour in order to improve the output of your cognition. What more could be asked?</p>
<p>The general idea is that our society has fixated far too much on the idea that the individual brain is the sole locus of thinking, of cognition, of creativity and problem solving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;brain as computer model&rdquo;, as though we each have a self-contained isolated CPU in our heads that performs our thinking at whatever speed and quality nature saw fit to bestow upon us. That would suggest that aside from sitting at a desk an individually focusing on formal education and training courses, perhaps we could improve our brain&rsquo;s performance by learning new ways to think about things within our brain, some lifehacks, engaging in brain training or supplementation, but that&rsquo;s about it. Intelligence is a &ldquo;fixed lump of something in our heads&rdquo;, and we design our home, schools and workplaces around that idea</p>
<p>But the author contends that this is all wrong. Modern research has shown that the brain should be thought of more as a magpie. It creates its output out of the materials it finds around it. Thinking uses resources external to the brain, and the nature of the materials available affects the quality of the thinking. Intelligence, as properly considered, isn&rsquo;t fixed, but rather a &ldquo;shifting state&rdquo; that depends on the level of access you have to resources outside of your brain and your ability to leverage them. This book gives you the knowledge to try and improve both of those for yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>And this is essential work! Modern day life involves absorbing a ton of information, often in abstract forms that we had no reason to evolve to be good at, so we aren&rsquo;t. Many of the challenges and tasks that face us are extremely complex.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t for nothing that the amount of journal papers and patent applications that have a single author is dwindling over time. At some point much &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; work may have exceeded the natural capability of almost anyone&rsquo;s individual brain, no matter how ensconced in an ivory tower it is.</p>
<p>The book is grouped into three main sections, each of which deals with a different sphere in which we can consider extending our mind.</p>
<p>The first is using our bodies, rather than our brains to help us think. We are more than brains on a stick. The second is adapting the environments we reside  in to enable improved thinking. In some ways  the trend in recent times has been to engineer ever worse environments for thinking as time goes on. And the last is to leverage our social natures, to &ldquo;think&rdquo; with our relationships to other people. Groups of people can be more than the sum of their individuals, particularly if proactively designed to work as such.</p>
<p>The argument is that at present we&rsquo;d be much better served in spending time figuring out how to improve our capabilities in using these external resources than undergoing individual training to improve some personal skill.</p>
<p>Three sets of general principles arise. The first concerns the &ldquo;habits of mind&rdquo; that we should adopt to improve the output of our thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offload information from your brain whenever you can. This could mean anything from writing down your thoughts or &ldquo;socially offloading&rdquo; them to other people.</li>
<li>Transform information into artefacts, ideally physical ones. Interact with them, tweak them, show them to other people.</li>
<li>Be proactive in altering your inner state. Take some physical exercise before trying to learn something. Synchronise with others before you attempt group work. Spend time in nature if you have an upcoming creative task.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second set of principles uses our understanding of what the brain evolved to do in order to grasp how mental extension works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim to &ldquo;re-embody&rdquo; information. Allow your body&rsquo;s interoceptive signals to influence your choices. Use physical movement to enact concepts. Focus on your gestures and those of others.</li>
<li>Re-spatialise information when possible. Our brain processes information via mental maps. Use memory palaces, concept maps and the like to leverage that evolved capacity.</li>
<li>Re-socialise information. We process it better when we involved others. Teach others what you know, learn from them, imitate, argue, debate and tell each other stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly we have a set of principles based on &ldquo;what kind of creatures we are&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberately create cognitive loops. Use your body to help you think, then spatialise the information, then run it through the brains of other people. Keep looping it through each realm, again and again.</li>
<li>Create &ldquo;cognitively congenial situations&rdquo;. Issuing orders to your brain is a strategy often destined to fail. Instead, create environments that draw out the desired result of your thinking. Explain things to your peers, share stories, create a meaningful private space, walk in nature. What you do should depend on your cognitive goal.</li>
<li>Embed extensions in your day-to-day environment. This can range from arranging &ldquo;identity cues&rdquo; in your workspace through to deliberately cultivating a transactive memory system with your colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the main takeaway is that the best thinking does not generally occur when you are sat still on your own in a bland, neutrally-lit grey office of the sort often designed to aid thinking via being &ldquo;distraction-free&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But other people, other environments, other ways of being, your feelings and emotions are not always distractions to good thought. Far from it. Often thoughtfully seeking them out and leveraging them to extend our minds can produce far better thinking outputs, much more suited to the modern world, than the environments we&rsquo;ve historically designed.</p>
<p>The title of the book seems to be a shout-out to Clark and Chalmers' paper &ldquo;<a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1">The Extended Mind</a>&rdquo;, which is referred to in the text. In that they argue in a somewhat similar vein for the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis">extended mind thesis</a>&rdquo; - namely that the mind isn&rsquo;t limited to our brains, or even our bodies.  Rather that external items in the physical world - a diary, a computer - can be considered as part of the cognitive process and as such as extension of the mind.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1694386825">GUTS</a> by Olivia Rodrigo.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite childhood High School Musical character to present-day singing a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55679805">wildly popular song</a> about getting a driving license artist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, is back with a new(ish) album in 2023.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at least as good as her first one. There&rsquo;s a variety of styles on show, plenty of pop-punk , with some big piano ballads and a smattering of rap. Much of it riddled with the self-doubt, insecurity, anger and clever disses about idiot men that seem to be part of a lot of the newer music I chance upon these days. Sign of the times I guess.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1560735414">first album</a> was also pretty great but <a href="https://www.popdust.com/olivia-rodrigo-sour-stillbreaks-records-2657796279.html">everyone&rsquo;s already heard it</a> so you probably already knew that.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">The Three-Body Problem</a> by Cixin Liu.
I remember this book got pretty rave reviews when it was published in English (and probably before - but I can only read English). Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/transcript-president-obama-on-what-books-mean-to-him.html">liked it</a>. <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2015/05/03/reading-for-hugos/">George R. R. Martin</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read">Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg</a>too. But don&rsquo;t let that put you off, plenty of people with less wealth and, depending on your point of view, megalomaniac desires like it too. It also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/23/no-award-hugo-awards-following-controversy">won a Hugo Award</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>I left it some time, trying to wait until I felt like I&rsquo;d the opportunity to really dedicate time and focus to appreciating it fully. Naturally that time never came, but thankfully I gave it a go anyway. And, predictably, also loved it.</p>
<p>The subject matter is pretty attuned to my interests. We start with 1960s Chinese politics, in the midst of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>. Our protagonist is unfortunate enough to watch her father die in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session">struggle session</a>. She herself is arrested for suspicion of not being a good enough Communist. The prospective penalties are severe.</p>
<p>By the end we&rsquo;ve worked our way through alien civilisations, conspiracies, detectives, spies and, metaversey-stuff, with some nice doses of science and philosophy. Inexplicable phenomena abound; why are a bunch of scientists killing themselves? What condition is causing someone to see numbers wherever he looks? What actually is the purpose of the strange military installation? Or the VR game that seems to have appeared out of nowhere?</p>
<p>But what always fascinates me most of all are authors’ ideas about the weird ways that human society might react when very important, very unprecedented, situations occur. Some of the ones herein might seem unlikely at first, but then again very little can be more wild that the IRL emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon">the QAnon cult</a> and its troubling downstream effects. Would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory">Pizzagate</a> sound realistic had it only appeared in a sci-fi novel?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told that so far “the entire history of humanity has been fortunate” - hard as that is to believe in current times - but sure, perhaps there’s a way in which that’s true in comparison to what is on the agenda here.</p>
<p>The book is not difficult to read despite the depth of the intellectual topics. It’s full of big, awesome, imaginative, and occasionally explicitly philosophical ideas that consumed my brain for a while. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll stick in my mind for a good long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first book of a trilogy.  There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m not going to read the others at some point after both the enjoyment this one brought and the way that it ended.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)">TV show version</a> of it expected to come to Netflix next year.</p>

			 <p>Remember the halcyon days of circa 2019, when OpenAI were <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/openai-gpt2-text-generating-algorithm-ai-dangerous.html">too nervous</a> to release GPT-2, yes, two, on an unsuspecting world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;OpenAI said that it would only be publishing a &ldquo;much smaller version&rdquo; of the model due to concerns that it could be abused. The blog post fretted that it could be used to generate false news articles, impersonate people online, and generally flood the internet with spam and vitriol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot changed in a few years.</p>
<p>2 generations of GPT later and now <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">anyone who has $10 to spare</a> can access the latest greatest GPT-4 - which has recently learned to &lsquo;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak">see, hear and speak</a>&rsquo; in-between its only-increasing potential to &lsquo;flood the internet with spam&rsquo; and &lsquo;generate false news articles&rsquo;, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23707788/ai-spam-content-farm-misinformation-reports-newsguard">it is indeed doing</a> to at least some extent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s necessarily a bad thing. Well, except the spam and fake news parts - these days there exist several extremely low effort websites that have leveraged it for exactly that purpose. After all, rich companies hoarding rare resources is rarely the most obviously optimal way to benefit humanity as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some in the machine learning community have accused OpenAI of exaggerating the risks of its algorithm for media attention and depriving academics, who may not have the resources to build such a model themselves, the opportunity to conduct research with GPT-2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps slightly Ironically, they seemed a lot more about putting the Open into OpenAI back in those days, philosophically at least. What as far as I know is their original manifesto is <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">still there on their site</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hoping to grow OpenAI into such an institution. As a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have proprietary secrets - &lsquo;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ak3w5a/openais-gpt-4-is-closed-source-and-shrouded-in-secrecy">OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4 Is Closed Source and Shrouded in Secrecy</a>&rsquo; says Motherboard - as well as exclusive deals with anyone who has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-15/how-chatgpt-openai-made-microsoft-an-ai-tech-giant-big-take">a few billion dollars</a> to throw their way.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781118530801">The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling</a> by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross.</p>
<p>Most everyone that&rsquo;s been in charge of designing a large database has recommended this to me as a good summary of how to think about the structure a data warehouse.</p>
<p>It teaches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimball_lifecycle">the Kimball method</a> - you might notice that&rsquo;s one of the authors' surnames. So if you&rsquo;ve come across terminology such as &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension">type 2 slowly changing dimension</a>&rsquo; or the facts and dimensions used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_fact_model">dimensional modelling</a> et al. then it&rsquo;s very possible that your interlocutor has read this tome.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m more an analyst than an engineer, I have dabbled in the latter and this book will be good guidance on how to think things through going forward.</p>
<p>A key aspect, and one I&rsquo;m grateful for, is to focus on making the data easy to understand and analyse in downstream tools, even if it requires substantially more effort - both technical and diplomatic - up front.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been helpful to me to understand why systems I use are set up like they are - e.g. a distinct absence of using null value where I&rsquo;d initially thought it&rsquo;d make sense to use them. It&rsquo;s also a refresher on basic patterns one can use to enable common analysis requirements like &lsquo;how many times has this value changed over time?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what would the results look like if they were remapped to the historical structure of the organisation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written rather prescriptively - follow this rule or regret it forever! I have been told by practitioners that sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary, or at least preferable, to break the occasional rule in reality but that their recommendations are good ones for the majority of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also organised slightly confusingly in that most of it is divided up into chapters seemingly aimed at various specific business applications e.g. e-commerce or insurance. But they&rsquo;re at pains to say that you shouldn&rsquo;t just read the one that&rsquo;s most similar to your organisation or the task you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish as you&rsquo;ll not understand it fully without all the context provided in the earlier chapters that from their title don&rsquo;t seem relevant to you. So I&rsquo;m not entirely certain why they structured it like that in the first place.</p>
<p>But that aside, it&rsquo;s invaluable reading for anyone designing databases or using other people&rsquo;s databases that are designed this way.</p>

			 <p>Remember when the Conservatives thought they were <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/we-are-coming-after-you-home-secretary-priti-patel-to-warn-criminals-11824598">the party of law and order</a>? Hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking here of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partygate">numerous illegal cringe-parties</a> the government and its associates held during the Covid-lockdown. Although do watch the <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/partygate">docu-drama &ldquo;Partygate&rdquo;</a> if you want to increase your level of annoyance at their doings even beyond whatever it currently is. But here I&rsquo;m thinking about rather more structural stuff.</p>
<p>Like how our former Home Secretary tried to coerce the police to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/12/suella-braverman-calls-for-further-action-against-pro-palestine-marches">certain peaceful protests</a> on the topic of Palestine. The police said no, mainly on the basis that <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/met-will-do-everything-it-can-to-prevent-disruption-to-remembrance-events-474935">there is no law that would let them do so</a> despite her suggestion that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/people-supporting-hamas-in-uk-will-be-held-to-account-says-rishi-sunak">waving a national flag might be illegal</a> - obviously <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/politics-explained/union-jack-flag-boris-johnson-b1822389.html">Union Jacks would be exempt</a>. She wasn&rsquo;t at all embarrassed, but rather wrote <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pro-palestine-protest-london-met-police-cbqnxbtv3">a rant basically about how the police are too woke</a> in a national newspaper which, thankfully, eventually, at least in part, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-sacked-home-secretary">got her fired</a>.</p>
<p>It comes to quite something when we have to rely on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/31/police-chiefs-blame-tory-cuts-for-fall-in-detection-and-charge-rates">shattered remnants</a> of the British police of all organisations - a large contingent of which have recently been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-misogynistic-homophobic-louise-casey-report">officially determined</a> to be &ldquo;institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic&rdquo; and seemingly <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/08/09/less-than-of.html">pretty terrible</a> at actually solving crime -  to be the last desperate hope against an illegal trampling of our civil liberties, to be the &ldquo;woke&rdquo; ones. But credit where credit&rsquo;s due, I applaud their actions in preventing a crime taking place in this case.</p>
<p>Now the courts ruled that the obviously illegal plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-61782866">ship off applicants for asylum</a> to other countries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda">was indeed illegal</a>. Despite the fact that it seems very plausible that his latest Home Secretary <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/james-cleverly-rwanda-scheme-batshit-sunak-b2448446.html">described the plan as &ldquo;batshit&rdquo;</a> in the past,  Sunak once again isn&rsquo;t embarrassed. Instead he&rsquo;s trying to find some way to get through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/rishi-sunak-to-bring-in-emergency-law-after-courts-rwanda-ruling">dubious new legislation</a> that &ldquo;allows&rdquo; him to ignore the court&rsquo;s decision, or pander to the worst of his party&rsquo;s instincts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/05/tory-mps-to-push-for-uk-exit-from-european-convention-of-human-rights">exit the ECHR</a>, as well as presumably any other legislation that has a chance of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html">protecting the outgroup, of binding the ingroup</a>.</p>
<p>What some of his party say is up there in terms of incitement to the famously irresponsible &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemies_of_the_People_(headline)">Enemies of the People</a>&rdquo; Daily Mail front page a while back. The police believe that Braverman&rsquo;s comments on the protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/12/police-say-suella-bravermans-claims-of-forces-bias-a-factor-in-attacks-on-them">were an important driving factor</a> in the violent attacks that far-right protesters -  note that this was a group that she <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> trying to ban - went on to perpetuate against them.</p>
<p>Further back of course there was all the Brexit stuff. Boris Johnson tried to pro-rogue Parliament to avoid mere democracy getting in the way of whatever his favourite idea of the time was at the time. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue">was deemed to have been illegal</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, when the quagmire of the Brexit they&rsquo;d &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; continued to become ever more apparent, some of the Conservative party - including their leader - decided that they&rsquo;d unilaterally invent some nice new legislation so that they could ignore the deal they&rsquo;d already signed up to regarding trade with Northern Ireland. Even their own ex-leader, Theresa May, said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill was <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/06/27/senior-conservatives-denounce-protocol-bill-as-illegal-under-international-law/">illegal under international law</a>.</p>
<p>There was a time when they also claimed to be the good at the economy. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/08908266-cc47-4cda-b8d4-97a8ac433a6d">Haha</a>.</p>

			 <p>In a finding that may not surprise anyone who endures reading this blog, a recent study found that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/humans-will-trade-pain-useless-information">Humans will trade pain for useless information</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The useless information in question was the implications of the results of a coin-flip. Participants would get a reward based on the result of  a series of coin-flips. But by default they weren&rsquo;t told what exactly the prizes associated with heads or tails were until after the fact. Importantly, it was set up to ensure that the participants knew that they would receive the exact same reward irrespective of whether or not they knew the values of each side in beforehand.</p>
<p>Participants were then offered the chance to know what the reward associated with each side of the coin was in advance, but at the cost of having pain inflicted on them - a &ldquo;flash of heat&rdquo; applied to their arm. When the pain was set to low, about 3/4 of participants requested to receive the pain and learn in advance about the rewards, information which has no obvious utility given the setup. Even when the pain was set to maximum participants would choose to undergo it nearly half the time.</p>
<p>One theory the researchers have as to why this occurs is that as humans we&rsquo;re just generally deeply uncomfortable with uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This willingness to endure pain in exchange for noninstrumental information may stem from a deep-seated aversion to uncertainty, Bode says—to the point that some people are willing to go through physical discomfort for a few scraps of solid information. “Not knowing is really painful,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted in the original article, pain isn&rsquo;t the only adversity we&rsquo;re willing to go through in order to learn about something we know can have no effect on or bearing to what happens to us. Previous studies have shown that people are prepared to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005020">pay money</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02850-3">put in unnecessary physical effort</a> in order to learn in advance how a lottery would pay out in a way that could not possibly affect how much they&rsquo;d win.</p>

			 <p>Never trust a social network you don&rsquo;t own, lesson number 999.</p>
<p>After a period of disuse, Facebook has permanently locked me out of my account for something I definitely didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Some time ago - I guess a long time ago - I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/214376678584711">deactivated my Facebook account</a>. I haven&rsquo;t really missed it all that much. Anyway, yesterday I decided to reactivate it so as to download all the photos I&rsquo;ve ever uploaded to it for safe storage, along with any that I&rsquo;m tagged in that I might like to revisit one day.  The latter isn&rsquo;t a native functionality as far as I&rsquo;m aware but browser extensions <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagged-photo-exporter-for/cicalpgkgmacgnbnnkhdgpnicipnihgo">like this one</a> purport to enable it.</p>
<p>This should of course be easy. From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/214376678584711">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to come back to Facebook after you&rsquo;ve deactivated your account, you can reactivate your account at any time by logging back in to Facebook or by using your Facebook account to log in somewhere else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, upon logging in to reactivate the account I was met with this message:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/img-5942.jpeg" width="300" height="155" alt="Facebook message indicating account has been disabled">
<p>My account has apparently been permanently disabled for contravening their spam policy. And because it had been over 180 days since they decided to do that - which I had seemingly no way of knowing had happened given my account was temporarily deactivated - there is no way to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Obviously I haven&rsquo;t been spamming anyone given I deactivated the account but there we go.</p>
<p>At the very least, given I&rsquo;d explicitly suspended my account so wasn&rsquo;t logging in, I&rsquo;d have expected to have received some kind of robotically generated email to let me know of the supposed spam crime within the 6 months window that would have allowed me to appeal if I cared enough.</p>
<p>The good news is that it was still possible to export my content; that&rsquo;s the 1 button that&rsquo;s still available even with the block. Although, it comes to you in a single big intricate zip file that may take some time to dig through. But if I had a desire to start using my Facebook account again - something that temporarily deactivating your account is explicitly supposed to allow - then that opportunity is gone.</p>
<p>As is my social graph of course. The photos are in the zip somewhere, along with a pretty useless list of all the comments I ever made stripped of context - who knows what it was that I loved so much 7 years ago!? But the connections between me and my friends are gone. I&rsquo;m not aware of any social network you could upload that kind of data to even if your friends all agreed to sign up to it. Mainstream social networks are silos.</p>
<p>Also naturally it only exports the content I uploaded. So photos by me; but not the photos <em>of</em>  me that someone else uploaded, tagged me and shared that I&rsquo;d probably have liked to keep, let alone photos of friends or family, old or new.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t all that terrible from my personal point of view. I&rsquo;ve little interest in using Facebook and I probably have better-quality backups of most of the photos. But some people might fairly be quite annoyed or upset in this situation.</p>
<p>As always the lesson to take away is that if you ever post anything to a social network you might ever care about, always keep a copy of it safe somewhere you control. And if you value your social graph, well, I&rsquo;m not sure that there is a solution other than being sure to have some other way to contact your nearest and dearest.</p>
<p>Similarly with your interactions; the to-and-from flow of any meaningful conversations you had or any threads that meant a lot to you. You’ll be able to export your ramblings, but without the context of what you were responding to. We all know how annoying hearing only half a telephone conversation is. Again given the private and proprietary nature of the service, it&rsquo;s hard to know how you can personally mitigate this. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to act like it&rsquo;s 1997 and start printing out everything you found fun on Facebook?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously an outlier because I haven&rsquo;t been using my account for a long time. But other people find themselves unable to access their Facebook accounts for all sorts of reasons in ways that are much more upsetting to them. There are endless discussions online about it, Reddit is a good place to start if you want to find examples.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this phenomenon <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60959811">making national news</a> last year - I assume it&rsquo;s not an April fool despite the publication date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;despite not being an avid user, finding her account locked was still upsetting: &ldquo;All of the images from my university years and family occasions are on Facebook</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will no longer have access to 15-plus years of content, which is genuinely sad</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also quite stressful not knowing what the issue is, and having no recourse to resolve it. To be given no warning and then no way to access our own data is mindboggling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course no-one has a legal right to have a Facebook account. It&rsquo;s a private company entitled to make its own decisions outside of basic legal requirements. Personally I think a lot of people might be better off without an account. But, believe it or not, Facebook truly is a positive experience for some people. And its sheer size and scope creates a kind of monopolisation such that as much as you&rsquo;re able to &ldquo;export your data&rdquo; - which is certainly a good and important thing - there is often little of use that the average person can do with that data.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply replicate everything you&rsquo;d made the effort to create in Facebook at home or in a competitor&rsquo;s site. Even if you could, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force the people and organisations you want to talk to to move over to someplace new, which is what you&rsquo;d have to do considering Facebook is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network">federated social network</a>.</p>
<p>Being locked out forever would be especially upsetting for those people for Facebook is where their community is, whether this is how their family prefers  communicate, where the organisations they have to deal with post or where their support groups are. Innumerable organisations - everything from book clubs to government agencies to medical services to advocacy groups and beyond - seem to have chosen Facebook or one of its equally siloed competitors as a primary place to communicate to their members. It&rsquo;s a risky thing to do when you do not have the final say as to who is able to participate.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://pca.st/podcast/bf4f3af0-43fb-013c-f6ee-0acc26574db2">Sherlock &amp; Co.</a> podcast.</p>
<p>Meet Dr. John Watson, an army medic who had to leave military life after suffering an unfortunate field injury. He ends up joining the seemingly infinite hordes of folk who are trying to scrape a living together via becoming podcasters. Specifically in his case a true crime podcast.</p>
<p>Sure enough, soon a mutual friend introduces him to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>. Holmes is bit of an odd-bod in the social realm but has uncanny powers of observation. They end up renting a flat from Mariana, who works for Hudsons estate agent. And suddenly Watson has a lot of stuff to podcast about.</p>
<p>These are the tales of Sherlock Holmes, each one acted out in radio play format, retold as though from the modern era. Gone are the letters of inquiry from Dukes. Instead we hear of the Insta posts from cringey male-feminist influencer wannabes. A little less reading through the day&rsquo;s newspapers, a little more trying to geolocate a Facebook video, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/11/15/we-are-bellingcat.html">Bellingcat style</a>.</p>
<p>Very fun, if you can tolerate the adverts. And a good excuse to read the originals again.

<p>Inevitably a problematic black market has formed. The UK health agency, MHRA, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-warns-of-unsafe-fake-weight-loss-pens">warns us</a> of the existence of at least hundreds of vials of entirely fake medication.</p>
<p>Some of the syringes being sold as containing semaglutide (Ozempic) or liraglutide (Saxenda) <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/26/health/british-health-agency-warns-of-fake-ozempic-pens-linked-to-hospitalizations/index.html">in fact contain insulin</a>. This has led to some users getting ill enough to require hospitalisation.</p>
<p>To the extent that Novo Nordisk et al. appear <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/weight-loss-earnings-eli-lilly-novo-nordisk/">unable to manufacture anywhere close to the amount</a> that would match the demand perhaps some of this is unavoidable, if still upsetting. The Faustian bargain that sure, these companies might become dazzlingly rich - which they are, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/09/05/flagship-drug-makes-novo-nordisk-europes-most-valuable-company-dethroning-lvmh">Novo Nordisk is now Europe&rsquo;s most valuable company</a> with a market cap larger than the GDP of the country it&rsquo;s situated in, Denmark, not all that surprising when each course of these treatments retail at thousands of dollars in some places - but that it&rsquo;s the only way to ensure that everyone&rsquo;s demand is being met has once again not really been working out well so far in this case.</p>
<p>But for any unmet need that&rsquo;s attributable to explicit or implicit gatekeeping or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/insurance-providers-are-halting-coverage-of-ozempic-and-other-glp-1-drugs">denying access</a> to this medication to patients who could benefit from it, this example reminds us of what&rsquo;s at stake when we don&rsquo;t enable people to safely access medications that could dramatically improve or even <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/26/treating-obesity-can.html">save their lives</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780679640035">Crime and Punishment</a> by Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>This is the book that has been acclaimed by some as the one of the first ever psychological thrillers, but I feel has also gathered a somewhat off-putting reputation as being difficult to read.  Which I don&rsquo;t think is deserved at all, at least not the translation I read. If you have any interest in it, be bold, give it a go.</p>
<p>We follow the life of young Rodion Raskolnikov, who lives a life of seemingly at least somewhat self-chosen poverty in Moscow. He&rsquo;s something of an over-thinker, a philosopher of some kind. And so we find him pondering on whether or not he would be justified in murdering a mean old pawn-broker who has been less than generous to him and others in times of need in order to steal her money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no spoiler to say that between deciding that her life is immoral and overdosing on the writings of Hegel et al to the extent of considering himself as a candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">Great Man of History</a> he manages to convince himself that it&rsquo;s a reasonable, and perhaps even moral, thing to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all goes down near the start of the novel. It doesn&rsquo;t go quite to plan of course.</p>
<p>In what follows we watch him trying to come to terms with what he did and to deal with what will come next. He spirals down through life-threatening maladies, both physical and mental. The police are poking around, his family do their best to care for him but sometimes in ways he cannot abide, ways that will put them at too much risk even whilst he cannot find a single nice word to say to them.</p>
<p>As the noose of suspicion tightens we see his mind whirl between the possibilities of confessing all - perhaps the mental torment would at least end?  - versus fleeing, leaving everyone who loves him behind - but what right has he to be loved? - vs the satisfaction - or is it delusion? -  of getting one over on whomsoever he sees as his enemy at the time, interlaced with some contemporary politics and philosophical thinking</p>
<p>The frantic, frenetic, paranoid mind of a man who deluded himself into doing something he has no idea how to get away from, or even if he really wants to get away from it, makes for a compulsive reading experience.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526615718">We Are Bellingcat</a> by Eliot Higgins.</p>
<p>This is the story of how Elliot Higgins went from curious internet user, through to an increasingly renowned commentator on blog articles, to starting <a href="https://brown-moses.blogspot.com/">his own blog</a> all the way through to running an increasingly large and influential organisation dedicated to open source intelligence investigations called <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/">Bellingcat</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">Open source intelligence</a>, or OSINT, is &ldquo;the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources&hellip;to produce actionable intelligence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Bellingcat, named after the fable &ldquo;<a href="https://fablesofaesop.com/belling-the-cat.html">Belling The Cat</a>&rdquo; , has famously used this technique to investigate and produce damning evidence on many geopolitical episodes, including the Malaysian Airlines <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/06/19/identifying-the-separatists-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/">flight MH17 crash</a>, the poisoning of Putin&rsquo;s enemies <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/">Alexei Navalny</a> and <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/">Sergei Skripal</a>, the <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2017/08/29/database-august-12-charlottesville-videos/">unmasking of neo-Nazis</a> in Charlottesville&rsquo;s rally as well as various unpleasant and illegal incidents occurring in recent <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/09/04/geolocating-libyas-social-media-executioner/">Libyan</a> and <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/21/the-open-source-hunt-for-syrias-favourite-sarin-bomb/">Syrian</a> conflicts . This book contains details of many of their increasingly complex and impactful investigations.</p>
<p>They also run <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/workshops/">training courses</a> to let other folk learn their very transferrable, very versatile skills. They&rsquo;re open about how, why and what they did. Transparency is one of the key tenets of their organisation. Knowing that there&rsquo;s no reason for you to trust them beyond any other voice on the internet, they make a big deal of recording and sharing exactly what they did, what their sources were, what they inferred vs validated and all the outstanding questions that they couldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;an online claim is nothing more than a hypothesis, one validated only with backing evidence that others should be able to corroborate themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their motto became &ldquo;Identify, Verify, Amplify&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The most fascinating aspect to me is around the tooling. We all splurge our data every day all over the internet. Most notably on social media of course but many of our daily transactions that we don&rsquo;t explicitly share are in someone&rsquo;s database somewhere - records of your phone usage, travels, identity, financial transactions, property ownership and a whole lot more. Sometimes this kind of data is publicly available legitimately for free or at a reasonable cost. Other times hacked versions are floating about the lesser known parts of the internet. On occasion the Bellingcat team seem to slightly deviate from the &ldquo;open source&rdquo; aspect of OSINT and hold their nose and resort to paying off employees of various organisations to share data with them.</p>
<p>Knowing what sources they&rsquo;ve found useful in their work both enables  you to conduct your own investigations as well as be a bit more aware of what you&rsquo;re potentially unknowingly sharing. This is surely a recommended skill for anyone who&rsquo;s been alive in at least the past decade or so. Some of the tools they&rsquo;ve used include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several Google products: <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/">Earth</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Maps</a>, <a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/">Translate</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808">reverse image search</a>.</li>
<li>An app called SunCalc that lets you estimate the time of gday a picture was taken via the shadows in it.</li>
<li>Search engines less known to the average British or American internet user, such as Russia&rsquo;s <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a>.</li>
<li>Online catalogue and databases of munitions, vehicles, property.</li>
<li>Various specialist message boards, military sites like <a href="https://www.janes.com/">Janes</a> or sites like <a href="https://uxoinfo.com/blogcfc/client/index.cfm">Uxoinfo</a> that describe unexploded ordnance.</li>
<li>Hobbyist sites - e.g. plane-spotting or license plate websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://wikimapia.org/">Wikimapia</a></li>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/11/13/arcade-claw-machines.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-13 09:38:41 &#43;0000">Nov 13, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>Only recently did I learn that those arcade claw machines where the game is to precisely navigate a claw over some stuffed toys or a priceless watch such that when it descends it grabs it and pops it in a chute for you to take away as winnings are literally impossible, rather than just extraordinarily difficult, to win most of the time.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/claw.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Photo of a claw machine">
<p>It turns out that a given claw has different strengths at different times. Full strength will grab and deliver the prize if you navigated it exactly right. But at all other times the claw isn&rsquo;t even in theory strong enough to hold the prize, so you&rsquo;ve no chance.</p>
<p>How strong the claw can be, and often the claw is strong, can typically be chosen or changed by the owner as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/3/8339999/claw-machines-rigged">this extract from a manual that Vox shared shows</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/man1.jpg" width="600" height="258" alt="Extract from a claw machine manual ">
<img src="uploads/2023/man2.jpg" width="600" height="382" alt="Another extract from a claw machine manual">
<p>Some claws may have several parameters. For example on occasion it might be strong enough to pick up the prize, but then then deliberately weakens and drops the object of desire just before it get over the retrieval slot, making for those ultra-addictive seeming near misses.</p>
<p>So really claw machines are not so different to &ldquo;pure&rdquo; gambling machines like fruit machines. Except you have to be both lucky <em>and</em> somewhat skilled. And they&rsquo;re less regulated in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Based on that manual extract it sounds like there might be a viable strategy involving secretly watching other people playing with the claw until it&rsquo;s been a while since anyone won anything and swooping in in the hope that strong mode is about to trigger. If you can live with yourself and really want that big fluffy toy teddy anyway.</p>
<p>Also as the owner can set the parameters of the machine, it&rsquo;d definitely be true that machines in some places might &ldquo;pay out&rdquo; a lot more than machines elsewhere.</p>

			 <p>When Spotify and its competitors launched it heralded a whole new way to listen to music. Suddenly everyone who could afford a relatively cheap monthly subscription and a device to use it on had access to a near infinite list of the world&rsquo;s most loved music. Recommendation algorithms would expose them to new music they&rsquo;re very likely to love. At the same time, it&rsquo;d cut down on the pull that led some people to pirate their music, so that artists would get paid more fully. Smaller artists who didn&rsquo;t have the means to promote or produce huge worldwide release could get an audience beyond their local pub. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<p>Inevitably, plenty. Naturally it&rsquo;s not only <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">extremely bad AI-written books</a> that are attempting to flood our media channels, and occasionally charts, with dross. Music provides another example, for many of the same reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the AI side of things - both the generative AIs that can &ldquo;create&rdquo; music. But also the more traditional, less hyped, AIs that are used to engage the user with the  apps concerned. And I suppose the AIs that listen to the music, more on that later.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more to be concerned about, including bad business models, bad incentives, and the exploitation that inevitably shows up once a few giant middle-men effectively monopolise the relationship between people that produce things of value and those that wish to consume them to the extent that they&rsquo;re incentives are entirely distinct from either party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an increasing fan of Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a>&rdquo;. Sure, songs are still songs, but &ldquo;song&rdquo; is vague enough that there&rsquo;s plenty of room for the medium of distribution to influence its content. Perhaps the delivery method is also the message to some extent. His colleague, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message">John Culkin, opined</a> that &ldquo;we shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us&rdquo;. Our music-creating, music-promoting and music-listening tools have certainly changed in recent times.</p>
<h2 id="torrents-of-new-music-flood-the-system-each-day">Torrents of new &ldquo;music&rdquo; flood the system each day</h2>
<p>Apparently there are 120,000 <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/there-are-now-120000-new-tracks-hitting-music-streaming-services-each-day/">new music tracks being uploaded to music streaming services such as Spotify each day</a>. Each <em>day</em>. MBW calculates that at that rate this year we&rsquo;ll have added 43 million new tracks to the archives - substantially more than even the estimated 34 million tracks uploaded last year.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/isrc.png" width="600" height="335" alt="">
<p>(An ISRC is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code">International Standard Recording Code</a>, used to uniquely identify sounds and music recordings.)</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, not all of these are new Taylor Swift songs, Beatle re-releases or even exciting new work from up-and-coming new indie bands. Some of it is literally noise; white noise, fan noise, rain noise, other noises are available. More of it is a near infinite of variety of customised &ldquo;Happy Birthday to X&rdquo; songs with X replaced by the names of most people you might imagine sending well-wishes to.</p>
<p>And an increasing amount of it is AI generated. And not even 2023-level-AI generated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Universal Music Group’s Q1 earnings call, Sir Lucian Grainge criticized what he calls the “content oversupply” that currently sees around 100,000+ tracks distributed to music streaming services each day.</p>
<p>“Not many people realize that AI has already been a major contributor to this content oversupply,” said Grainge.</p>
<p>“Most of this AI content on DSPs comes from the prior generation of AI, a technology that is not trained on copyrighted IP and that produces very poor quality output with virtually no consumer appeal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-incentive-structure-encourages-people-to-game-the-system">The incentive structure encourages people to game the system</h2>
<p>But, similar to the way <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">Kindle Unlimited pays its authors</a>, it&rsquo;s not really the quality of the track that matters. It&rsquo;s whether it was played a lot or not. It&rsquo;s the word that we&rsquo;ve perhaps all learned to dread a little: &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;. 1000 people playing a minute of white noise often produces the same revenue for the creator as 100 people listening to a 10-track album of Taylor&rsquo;s finest.</p>
<p>As the CEO of Warner Music puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I note he doesn&rsquo;t specify whether an Ed Sheeran stream is worth more <a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/music/why-does-everyone-hate-ed-sheeran/">or less</a> than a recording of the rain, but either way you can probably think of some track of music you personally feel confident has a great deal more value to you and perhaps even to the world at large than listening to one of a million varieties of rain, a good proportion of which might actually 2010-era auto-generated AI fake rain noise.</p>
<p>So where do we end up? With the same dynamics as we had for <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">those terrible AI-written Kindle books</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;.the inevitable coming together of the generative AI infocalypse, enshittified subscription service monopolies, misguided algorithmic recommendation systems and the incentives of modern-day capitalism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course leads &ldquo;creators&rdquo; to game the system. Which is why every time I try to listen to something popular like <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/26/listening-to-endless.html">&ldquo;Flowers&rdquo;</a> I have to be quick on the pause button if I don&rsquo;t want to end up listening to an algorithmically generated rotation of various knockoff variations of the original. Or, to be honest, one reason why for the most part I relieve the pre-Spotify era and almost always listen to music in units of albums, rather songs or playlists. As a sidenote, if this too is your preference and you&rsquo;re an Apple Music user then I heartily recommend the iOS <a href="https://www.albumstheapp.com/">Albums app</a> which near-forces you into that mode of operation.</p>
<p>Not all of the system gaming is AI adjacent of course. Humans are more than capable of coming up with their own quantity-increasing quality-reducing schemes. Six years ago, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/streaming-music-cheat-codes.html">Vulture wrote up</a> some of those shenanigans for us to peruse.</p>
<p>There are the aforementioned people trying to trick you into listening to their knockoff version of whatever the current genuine-hit song is. It might be a cover, or it might be something totally different but with a similar sounding name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the coverbots and ripoff artists who vomit out inferior versions of popular songs every week, flooding the website with dreck that only succeeds when users are misled. No one would willingly listen to King Stitch’s “Sit Down, Be Humble,” a third-rate cover of Lamar’s original, but the track has been streamed more than 300,000 times thanks to Spotify’s broad search results and a clever title designed to confuse those who don’t know the song’s real name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s entries that are not a malicious deception. They&rsquo;re just not really the same category of thing as the classic idea of an album, even though they are displayed indistinguishably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some artists, a term used very loosely here, are providing people exactly what they want. It just so happens that what they want is ephemeral nonsense. Take, for example, the artist Happy Birthday Library, whose Spotify catalogue consists of hundreds of personalized versions of “Happy Birthday” streamed more than a million times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithms and incentives naturally have an effect on the actually talented and occasionally mega-famous folks too, reshaping what they produce and share. Vulture, <a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/">and others</a>, suggests that the reason Chris Brown released a 40 track album is because that&rsquo;s the way to boost your streaming numbers the most. Remember, you get paid per stream of each track - not each album. This huge-track count trick can naturally be used by lesser-known folk too</p>
<p>As they conclude, albeit perhaps with rather rose-tinted spectacles on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never before has a song title or artist name been more important than the actual songs themselves.
&hellip;
Never before have so many songs existed just so an album can have a 20th, 30th, or 40th track</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall they list 11 ways they&rsquo;ve noticed artists adapting to Spotify&rsquo;s incentives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Happy Birthday gimmick mentioned above. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to listen to a song entitled &ldquo;Happy Birthday whatever-your-name-is&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Writing songs about everything someone might conceivably search for; their example being &ldquo;the song “Have You Been to Radnor Township?” on the 93-track album Pennsylvania Songs: PA Exiting&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Releasing multiple albums with the same songs, often titled differently.</li>
<li>Release an absolutely silent &ldquo;song&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Convincing people to get their computers to fake-listen to the song.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Filling the void&rdquo; - releasing covers of songs from famous artists who aren&rsquo;t on Spotify.</li>
<li>Trying to trick people by naming their songs very similarly to more famous ones. Someone searching for Imagine Dragon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; might not realise they accidentally clicked on the 1-hit wonder Imagine Demon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Covering everything famous, all the time.</li>
<li>Adding unnessecary extra tracks to albums as noted above.</li>
<li>Putting your past popular singles in your new album.</li>
<li>Seeding popular Spotify playlists with fake artists - something Spotify has been accused of doing, more on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so is it all greedy users exploiting the opportunities the likes of Spotify inadvertently make available to them? No, it is not. It&rsquo;s easy to go too far in absolving the platforms for their responsibility for this.</p>
<p>For one, it&rsquo;s 2023. We know how these things go. Everything product decision is a choice. The big platforms decide where to prioritise their development. They decide what they accept and how. If some of the above isn&rsquo;t what the platforms want to promote then surely if users can find it easily enough to repeatedly write articles about the issue then so could they, given their access to reams of confidential internal data.</p>
<p>In fact they do, sometimes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Spotify <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spotify-ai-music-generator-purges-bots-listening-songs-1850419032">removed thousands of AI generated songs</a> from its catalogue. Many were those autogenerated by <a href="https://boomy.com/">Boomy</a> - a site that sells itself as enabling you to &ldquo;Create original songs in seconds, even if you&rsquo;ve never made music before&rdquo; and &quot; Submit your songs to streaming platforms and get paid when people listen&quot;.</p>
<p>Now as with many generative AI tools, it may not be a bad thing in principle. It might enable people who otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to create their own music be able to, in the same way as the image generators could allow expressions of novel creativity otherwise unavailable to most. But it&rsquo;s also catnip for folk that care more for income than art.</p>
<h2 id="robots-are-creating-music-for-robots-to-listen-to">Robots are creating music for robots to listen to</h2>
<p>So why did Spotify go on a deleting rampage of these tracks? Not particularly because they weren&rsquo;t a great experience for the average user. And there&rsquo;s certainly no prohibition on using AI to write or help write one&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>Rather it was because the people <em>listening</em> to that music were fake. Remember that Spotify pays out based on how many people listen to your tracks. So &ldquo;creators&rdquo; built bots that  &ldquo;listened&rdquo; to the tracks again and again. It&rsquo;s essentially fraud, given the terms of service.</p>
<p>So in a somewhat dystopian-feeling loop, people are using AI to create music that is mostly listened to by other AIs, no humans involved.</p>
<p>The business model and recommendation algorithms of the mainstream music streaming platforms - quantity over quality, quantity over everything - makes them as vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm">clickfarms</a> as any other type of site that provides some kind of reward for attracting lots of traffic of any kind. In this case Spotify has to pay for it directly, which is finally enough of a reason for them to act on it.</p>
<p>People are trying to measure these fake listeners. A French government organisation reported <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/fake-music-streams-france-1-billion-2021-report/">that 1-3% of all French streams</a> in 2021 were fraudulent based on data from Spotify, Deezer and Qobuz. This is likely an underestimate due to the use of VPNs and the like.</p>
<p><a href="https://beatdapp.com/">Beatdapp</a>, a company who sells a tool that looks for streaming fraud so is admittedly incentivised to claim that there&rsquo;s a lot of it, wrote that at least 10% of all streaming activity in 2022 was fraudulent. That&rsquo;s equivalent to $2 billion of revenue illegitimately extracted. They believe that it&rsquo;ll be worth $7.5 billion by 2030 if it is not stopped.</p>
<p>The fact that more streams = more money has also been more publicly exploited in the past. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/">Eternify was a service that lets users input the name of their favourite artists</a> and it&rsquo;d play their songs on repeat for exactly 30 seconds each on Spotify. 30 seconds was the threshold at which the artist gets paid, so this was a way you could optimise the income of your preferred musicians without the obstacle of having to actually listen to their output. The site would slowly count up the revenue your mouse-click had accrued for them.</p>
<p>It seems to be have been more of a protest statement from some understandably disenchanted musicians than something that aimed to enable fraudsters. And it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have saved many starving artists without a truly mass takeup. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/">Forbes calculated</a> that using it for a solid day would generate perhaps $1.44 for the artist in question. In any case, it cost Spotify directly enough to make them go to the effort of <a href="https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/06/26/spotify-shuts-down-royalty-boosting-scheme-eternify/">shutting it down</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-pay-most-musicians-receive-from-the-service-is-incredibly-low">The &ldquo;pay&rdquo; most musicians receive from the service is incredibly low</h2>
<p>The $1.44 a day figure reveals another not-so-hidden truth. These services are really not paying out a lot of money to the creators of what they&rsquo;re selling access to. So much so that even a committee of British MPs - a group <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html">not particularly known</a> for its sympathy or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/30/the-guardian-view-on-cuts-to-arts-funding-a-calamity-that-must-be-averted">care for artists</a> - are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473">worried about it</a>.</p>
<p>From all that revenue you&rsquo;re providing to the streaming services, the folk involved in producing the music are receiving about 16% of it.</p>
<p>Spotify is thought to be paying out between £0.002 and £0.0038 every time you play a stream. Apple Music pays a bit more, a whopping £0.0059. Youtube a bit less, about £0.00052.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;pays out&rdquo; is doing a lot of work there, as even many of the reports about &ldquo;Spotify only pays artists £x&rdquo; seem to miss. That 0.2 pence has got to be divided up between anyone with interests or rights to the music, as well as each member of the band, the composer, the writers, and so on.</p>
<p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473">provides an infographic</a> to help us visualise what that means.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/119425053-stream-revenue-640-2x-nc.png.jpg" width="600" height="738" alt="A diagram showing where the revenue paid out from streaming goes">
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the recording industry was particularly renowned for being favourable to artists even before the streaming revolution. Anyway, all in all, the recording artist(s) often might expect to receive about 13% of that 0.2p. Under a third of a penny.</p>
<p>Thirds of pennies don&rsquo;t add up fast. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musician&rsquo;s Union suggested that over 80% of musicians made less than £200 a year from streaming during 2019. 93% didn&rsquo;t break the £1000 milestone.</p>
<p>Sure, the megastars might earn substantially more than enough to survive on, but even their entourage aren&rsquo;t necessarily doing well. The writer of one of the songs on Kylie Minogue&rsquo;s number-one charting album &ldquo;Disco&rdquo; reported receiving £100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,&rdquo; she told MPs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite shameful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="spotify-seems-to-be-gaming-its-own-platform">Spotify seems to be gaming its own platform</h2>
<p>Back to the fake streams. As wrong as it is, let&rsquo;s not feel <em>too</em> sorry for some of the platforms subject to this streaming fraud. Spotify&rsquo;s seeming attempts to game it&rsquo;s own system at the expense of other artists and their own users have been written about elsewhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the time it was found to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/spotify-said-to-retaliate-against-artists-with-apple-exclusives?leadSource=uverify%20wall">burying songs</a> from musicians because they&rsquo;d also made deals with their rivals. Maybe that&rsquo;s understandable, maybe not, but I&rsquo;d guess most users don&rsquo;t understand that to be what&rsquo;s going on when they search for a song.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even less obvious is that sometimes Spotify decides to pay producers a flat fee to create tracks such that Spotify owns the copyright. They then upload them to their own serivce under fake artist names, people that don&rsquo;t exist. Why?</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-creating-its-own-recordings-and-putting-them-on-playlists/">Music Business Worldwide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would Spotify be instructing producers to write and record tracks of this nature?</p>
<p>Bingo: to appear on some of its relaxing first-party playlists, which boast millions of followers between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now they don&rsquo;t seem to get anything like as many plays as the most popular songs on the platform so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s necessarily dominating the user experience. But each time users plays a track from one of these fake artists Spotify only has to pay itself the stream royalties. Over 50 fake artists of this kind <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-spotifys-fake-artists-problem-is-an-epidemic-literally/">have been found</a> now, almost all of which have had millions of streams.</p>
<p>As ever, it&rsquo;s not entirely a black and white issue. Spotify have explicitly denied some (but perhaps not all) of these allegations. And, in this case, behind the fake artists are real people playing real music. They&rsquo;re just paid in a way much more favourable to Spotify at scale than other artists, and they seem to have an automatic route to being included in much-coveted very popular playlists.</p>
<p>Spotify curated playlists apparently account for <a href="https://bandzoogle.com/blog/how-to-get-your-music-featured-on-spotify-playlists">around a third</a> what&rsquo;s listened to on the platform in terms of time. To get onto one of them, most musicians have to actively <a href="https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/">pitch their music</a> for inclusion, one song at a time, before the song has been released. Most of the pitches, <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/behind-the-playlists-your-questions-answered-by-our-playlist-editors">around 80%</a>, are turned down without explanation.</p>
<p>Arguably, similar dynamics exist in other types of streaming services. Netflix does of course make its own shows which it heavily promotes on its own service. But as a user it does feel disingenuous to me at least. Why not label these tracks as having been produced by Spotify? Why not explain how they got onto the playlists?</p>
<p>Based on some patent applications, some folk <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/spotify-could-soon-replace-real-artists-with-ai-music">seem to think</a> that eventually Spotify might take the human out of the creation process altogether, potentially filling its playlists with music they generated themselves via AI. Presumably competing against those independent users uploading their own AI music, albeit with potentially a thumb on the scale.</p>
<h2 id="enshittification-yet-again">Enshittification, yet again</h2>
<p>Platforms such as Spotify appear to potentially provide great examples of Doctorow&rsquo;s <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">theory of enshittification</a>. When they first launched they appeared provided incredible value for users, revolutionary in some ways. You could access literally millions of much-sought after music for a relatively low monthly cost - or even free on Spotify at least if you were happy to tolerate adverts - entirely on demand. A radio station perfectly attuned to your minute-by-minute preferences. A way to experience far more of the musical art than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html">you could ever afford</a> to if you were paying £12.99+ for an individual album like ye olde days. An experience much safer and easier, not to mention less criminal and more conducive to rewarding musicians than yesteryear&rsquo;s internet underground <a href="https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/">piracy scene</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lofty-optimism-of-spotify-and-the-influence-of-the-streaming-revolution">The New Yorker wrote</a> about Spotify 5 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company is essentially insisting that freer and easier access to music is the only thing that matters; everything should be available to everyone, because freedom of choice is an essential freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The platforms attracted so many listeners with this fabulous promise that they became attractive, perhaps essential, to artists. Even many of the very rich very famous names who have sworn off Spotify at some point in time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat">came</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/thom-yorke-solo-albums-back-on-spotify.html">back</a>, presumably for the audience and its impact on the charts. If you weren&rsquo;t popular on Spotify then you&rsquo;d not so much hope of ever topping the bill, attracting the most revenue, being the most famous.</p>
<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;d even enable vast numbers of people to realise their artistic dreams in a way they&rsquo;d otherwise never have been able to. As <a href="https://pennyfractions.ghost.io/spotify-s-revolutionary-plan-to-support-one-million-artists/">they wrote 4 years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the goal of our marketplace strategy is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now, in the final stage, the platforms claw back more and more of the value for themselves.</p>
<p>They stop gaining marketshare only by virtue of being <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/02/will-spotify-ever-turn-a-profit/">able to sustain periods of loss</a>.  They <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630821/spotify-design-home-music-podcasts-audiobooks-app">change the user interface</a> longer than their competitors. What&rsquo;s promoted, when and how becomes something less aligned with the reasons that many users may have originally signed up. They try to make it inconvenient for either <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/how-to-quit-spotify-and-what-you-give-up-if-you-do.html">users</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/03/why-artists-leaving-spotify/">creators</a> to leave, and costly for artists to make deals with competitors.  They acquire potential future competitors or expand into adjacent-ish markets to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/spotify-needs-to-profit-from-a-music-revolution/2023/01/18/e71c548c-96ef-11ed-a173-61e055ec24ef_story.html">increase the perceived lock-in</a>. They <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021">raise prices</a> - although some believe that the recent near-universal streaming price rises in conjunction with a cost-of-living crisis is resulting in <a href="https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2023/10/30/online-piracy-streaming">an increase in piracy</a>. They alter recommendation algorithms, alter incentives.</p>
<p>All very logical from the point of view of shareholder value et al, at least in the short term. It&rsquo;s not necessarily driven by maliciousness; I&rsquo;m sure many of Spotify&rsquo;s employees love music, love musicians, embrace that vision of enabling a million artists to live off their work. It&rsquo;s just that at the end of the day the company&rsquo;s own incentive is all about coming up with the financial arrangements that most benefit themselves in the marketplace, whether or not it&rsquo;s at the expense of either or both sides of the user-creator relationship that&rsquo;s the fundamental reason that they can exist in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools-shape-us">The tools shape us</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s more amorphous to define and subjective to evaluate, but perhaps these services have significantly changed how we tend to consume music beyond the technical side of things. McLuhan and Culkin&rsquo;s quotes apply on the demand side too. The medium is the message. We shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us.</p>
<p>In days of yore, listeners would usually have to invest financially in a specific number of physical instantiations of music; a cassette tape, a CD or an LP album amongst other formats. In the iPod era this moved onto digital downloads, but still at the level of purchasing individual songs rather than access to a smorgasbord of (a somewhat misleading perception of) everything everywhere, all at once, all the time.</p>
<p>For most people this put a limit on how much music they had access to. This seems prima facie bad at first glance, and perhaps it is. But maybe it also encouraged folk to spend more time and intention in choosing what they listened to, more time exploring any one individual work.  I expect a fair proportion of people don&rsquo;t even know what they recently listened to when they&rsquo;ve opened their app at the start of the day and hit the &ldquo;especially for you&rdquo; playlist.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">the Guardian talked to a bunch of people</a> who&rsquo;d moved from streaming music back to more traditional forms of consumption they found some examples of this. Here&rsquo;s Lethem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[With streaming] there’s endless accessibility, but you’re not really listening to anything. At least that’s what it started feeling like to me. I’m experiencing so much music, but am I really listening to any of it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like what the algo chose then you can just hit skip 5 seconds in and be provided with something else that tries to hook you in. And it&rsquo;ll continue forever. There&rsquo;s no real concept of sitting down to appreciate an album end-to-end when the album is a literally endless playlist.</p>
<p>Many of these services do let you listen by album of course, at least if you pay them for that ability. I&rsquo;d be curious to know how many people still do that. It&rsquo;s certainly not the style of listening I feel like I see most heavily encouraged by the apps. Similar to the Youtube and Netflix style next-episode auto-play, the last thing they want to do is make you think you &ldquo;finished&rdquo; something to the extent you close the app.</p>
<p>Fairly incredibly, Spotify even used to default to shuffling the tracks of the album you selected into a random order <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/21/spotify-hides-shuffle-button-adele-albums-should-tell-a-story">before Adele requested they stopped doing that</a> because, of course, there is usually a reason why the tracks were put in that order in the first place. To quote her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some more conceptual albums would surely simply make very little sense out of order.</p>
<p>So hey, it&rsquo;s not like Spotify <em>never</em> listens to feedback, at least from megastars. Although even now you do have to be a paying customer of Spotify in order to be given the privilege of a &ldquo;play in the proper order&rdquo; button.</p>
<p>More recently Amazon actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-music-alexa-restrictions-shuffle-11674054533">went in the opposite direction</a> for its basic music streaming service. Subscribers to Amazon Prime, a service that costs around £9 a month and offers a variety of benefits to Amazon customers including music streaming, found that instead of the previous behaviour of being to choose what they listen to, when they requested music by a particular artist they would get a single track from that artist followed by a load of tracks from other people. Even their manually customised playlists started to shuffle around.</p>
<p>An unhappy customer reports his confusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. McKenna, who lives near Albany, N.Y., spent years curating Amazon Music playlists&hellip;.Recently, the app began playing a rock song he had never heard. When he got to the office, he tried to click on a Kenny Chesney song in his playlist, but it didn’t work. Songs he didn’t recognize kept playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Bob, his chronologically-defined playlists not any more being chronological was enough to drive him back to CDs and Windows Media Player - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve gone back to 2005&rdquo;. The only way to keep hold of your Amazon Music collection and listen to what you want to when you want to now became to upgrade to the more expensive &ldquo;Amazon Unlimited&rdquo; service.</p>
<p>Shifts in people&rsquo;s listening choices are certainly not all about these services removing features that were once there. Even where you can in theory still choose to listen to exactly what you want, here&rsquo;s Nick from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">previously-mentioned Guardian article</a> confirming a shift in his behaviour he experienced soon after switching to streaming that I suspect is quite common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found myself selecting more and more just one-off songs from an artist, whereas before I’d been inclined to save a whole album</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; alternative 20 years ago was to listen to the radio or a TV channel like MTV where for the most part you are subjected to other people&rsquo;s musical selections. From beginning to end, with no skip button. This might let you discover something so new and wonderful that you - and your 2023 recommendation algorithm - would never have considered if left to your own devices. On the other hand you had to listen to a lot of dross you didn&rsquo;t like, and would perhaps never happen to be listening at the right time to hear songs you were more likely to enjoy  - so again, nothing here is all good or all bad. But it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Finlay, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">the same Guardian article</a>, spoke to the issue above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With streaming, he says: “If I didn’t gel with an album or an artist’s work at first, I tended not to go back to it.” But he realised that a lot of his all-time favourite albums were ones that grew on him over time. “Streaming was actually contributing to some degree of dismissal of new music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jared speaks to both upsides and downsides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My musical experiences definitely feel more dedicated and focused. It’s not as convenient. I’ll reluctantly admit that I listen to less music. Although on Spotify, I wasn’t necessarily listening to stuff. I was checking out the first 15 seconds and hitting skip. Now, I have to work for it and I like that. I can use the internet as a search tool but I’m not using it as a means to listen. I really have to seek things out and research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virginia likewise, exhibiting a pattern I found myself adhering to at first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will listen to one song 100 times in a row, but I won’t give the rest of the album a chance. Before I used streaming services, I would listen to the whole thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even conceptually, the word &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; has connotations that may affect how we feel about what we&rsquo;re listening to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before there was streaming music, what else was streaming? This idea that you can just turn on a faucet, and out comes music. It’s something that leaves everyone to take it for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, many of these ex-streamer folk talked about the extra work they now had to do to find what they like. It can comes at a financial cost too, which risks making some of what I wrote seem elitist and gatekeepery as well as Ludditey. After all why should only people with time and wealth to spare have access to reasonable quantities of music? What&rsquo;s wrong with having convenient and cheap access to so much art? Nothing on the face of it, if we can find a business model that doesn&rsquo;t incentivise its enshittification and abuse of the creators.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-isnt-necessarily-cheap-and-you-end-up-owning-nothing">Streaming isn&rsquo;t necessarily cheap, and you end up owning nothing</h2>
<p>Although I would note that for the moderately well-off that it&rsquo;s not clear to me that paying for a year of Spotify is necessarily cheaper than buying a few albums that mean something to you. Right now, Spotify paid edition would cost you £131.88 a year. That would also buy you a good amount of singles, albums, whatever you&rsquo;re into. That might well suit people who prefer to or simply happen to end up listening to a certain subset of everything repeatedly. And it&rsquo;s almost certainly better for the artists concerned.</p>
<p>It also means your music becomes &ldquo;yours&rdquo;. You can keep a CD or, let&rsquo;s be realistic given it&rsquo;s 2023, an MP3 or lossless music file whether or not you want to keep subscribing to any given service. I&rsquo;ve been an Apple Music subscriber in my time, and I liked the service. But assuming one day you will choose to, or be forced to, stop paying the company the monthly fee then it&rsquo;s all gone. If I want to switch to a different service then it&rsquo;s a faff. Copying your favourite playlists, likes, subscribes, downloads et al  to a new place isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy - the new service may even be missing some of your tracks. And moving your carefully refined recommendation algorithms across services isn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s radar at all and probably won&rsquo;t ever be; it&rsquo;s each company&rsquo;s secret sauce.</p>
<p>You also certainly can&rsquo;t give your collection or pieces of it to anyone. You can&rsquo;t give what you don&rsquo;t own. I can&rsquo;t find it now, but I remember reading a story about the joy and meaning someone got from inheriting the music collection of their sadly recently-deceased father; the feelings and memories that listening to what he&rsquo;d collected over a lifetime evoked. But that&rsquo;s something that likely becomes unavailable with a shift to streaming.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any documentation about what happens to someone&rsquo;s music streaming account when they die, outside of <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;filter=location&amp;location=forum-board:spotifyaccountrelated&amp;q=deceased">several posts on the Spotify forums</a> that mainly end in &ldquo;try asking customer services&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s surely not something that someone inherits&gt; If you don&rsquo;t know the person&rsquo;s password and can open to their email then access may be gone for good. If it&rsquo;s a pay-for service then I imagine every trace of it simply vanishes as soon as the credit card fails to bill.</p>
<p>Talking about dying is admittedly a little dramatic. But there are other ways your favoured streaming services might be denied to you even whilst alive. Services close, even ones from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-play-music-will-shutdown-completely-in-december-heres-how-to-save-your-music">hugely successful companies</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say goodbye to Google Play Music, the service will be going away for good in December 2020 and with it, all your music if you don&rsquo;t transfer it over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you old enough to remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio">Rdio</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Music">Beats Music</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Music_Unlimited">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a>? Or any of the other 20-30 services currently listed on Wikipedia in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services#Discontinued_services">its &ldquo;Discontinued services&rdquo; section</a>, either entirely shut down or purchased by and replaced with the current handful of big players.</p>
<p>Or you may simply lose access to your account. If Apple, Amazon, Spotify, or whoever you&rsquo;re with decide for some reason that they don&rsquo;t want you to have an account then it&rsquo;s all gone. The various chatboards of the internet are full of stories of people losing their accounts from the big tech firms. Oftentimes they&rsquo;re more concerned about their emails or photos than their music. But it&rsquo;s all the same. If Apple, Spotify or the rest of them decide you&rsquo;ve been misbehaving, or can&rsquo;t be convinced that you are who you say you are, then whatever effort you&rsquo;ve put into maintaining your collection is lost. I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s probably rarer for this to happen with music streaming services than some categories - it&rsquo;s harder to imagine being accused of &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; a music streaming account but as many Reddit posts show, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>For the paid-only services, which is most of them, of course the same happens if your circumstances change such that you can no longer afford the service. And even if not, you&rsquo;re bound to implicitly supporting any changes in the streaming company&rsquo;s rules, strategies, personnel or ethics if you want to keep the music flowing. This might well be a price worth paying for many people, for most people. But it is a price.</p>
<p>If one of these eventualities does happen to you, then there are third-party services that try attempt to transfer your streaming collections and various metadata between one such service and another, although I haven&rsquo;t tried any of them out enough to know how well they work. But not if you already lost access to the service you want to move from. And of course they won&rsquo;t be able to transfer your playlists, likes et al to a service that doesn&rsquo;t have the particular track involved.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/">This interactive visualisation</a> is a great way of explaining or visualising what a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d">Cohen&rsquo;s d effect size</a> actually means in the real world.</p>
<p>Enter the d in question, or by clicking the cogwheel you can enter means and standard deviations, and the slightly-arcane-seeming resulting &rsquo;d' value is translated into an explanation rather easier to get one&rsquo;s head around.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a Cohen&rsquo;s d of 0.80, 78.8% of the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will be above the mean of the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group (Cohen&rsquo;s U3), 68.9% of the two groups will overlap, and there is a 71.4% chance that a person picked at random from the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group (probability of superiority).</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to have one more favorable outcome in the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group compared to the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group, we need to treat 3.5 people on average. This means that if there are 100 people in each group, and we assume that 20 people have favorable outcomes in the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group, then 20 + 28.3 people in the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will have favorable outcomes.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/11/08/homelessness-isnt.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-08 17:54:24 &#43;0000">Nov 8, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Our Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, tell us that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-rising-homelessness-a-crisis-made-in-government">homelessness crisis</a> in Britain is in fact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/04/fury-as-braverman-depicts-homelessness-as-a-lifestyle-choice">people making a &ldquo;lifestyle choice&rdquo;</a>. Especially those pesky foreigners.</p>
<p>Even her fellow Conservative, Bob Blackman, who heads up a group that aims to tackle homelessness thinks this is a phrase too far and believes she should use &ldquo;wiser words&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Amnesty has it right - claiming that there&rsquo;s queues of people just longing to live the decadent luxury of shelter-free lifestyle is nothing but a &ldquo;very convenient cop-out&rdquo; for a Government whose repeated failures do nothing but exacerbate the crisis.</p>
<p>In reality the unhoused &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; is not so glamorous. A group of interested charities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/05/charities-criticise-suella-braverman-for-claim-homelessness-is-lifestyle-choice">put together a letter</a> better explaining the experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People sleeping rough frequently experience violence and abuse. The impact on their physical and mental health is significant. The average age of death for people experiencing homelessness is just 45 for men and 43 for women. This is not a life people choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The homelessness issue, particularly the more extreme cases where people find themselves forced to sleep on the streets, is especially frustrating because it&rsquo;s also entirely unnecessary. We know how to solve it if we really wanted to.</p>
<p>Because we already did, back in early Covid times when the UK chose to find a way to <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1254504256423542786">house the vast majority</a> of rough sleepers. Yes, under a Conservative government!  Some of those provided shelter even gained access to assistance with things like benefit applications or medical treatments.</p>
<p>But apparently all decent and humane things have to come to an end. In July 2020 the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/coronavirus-homelessness-uk-rough-sleepers-lockdown-tories">funding was withdrawn and governmental responsibility for helping these people in need shirked</a> - even whilst Covid was of course still very much circulating around.</p>
<p>Back to contemporary times where not only are we supposed to believe that living on the streets is universally nothing but a lifestyle choice, but that the largest threat to the fabric of British society is&hellip;tents.</p>
<p>So much so that the Home Secretary is seemingly trying to slot in a new policy that will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/07/tax-on-vapes-could-be-part-of-plans-to-create-a-smokefree-generation-in-uk">fine any charity that gives a tent to a person without shelter</a>. This seems to be a step too far for even many of the current Conservative party, so tbd on whether it makes it into the Kings Speech or not.</p>
<p>Either way, with ideas like this a certain contingent of today&rsquo;s Conservative party does seem to have developed some real &ldquo;<a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/22637762/vox-conversations-adam-serwer-the-cruelty-is-the-point">The Cruelty Is The Point</a>&rdquo; vibes.</p>

			 <p>Jennifer Daniel shares <a href="https://jenniferdaniel.substack.com/p/new-emoji-coming-at-you-in-2025">what we can expect</a> for official new emojis in 2025.</p>
<p>Just seven this time, apparently selected for their linguistic flexibility, amongst other things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Face with bags under eyes</li>
<li>Fingerprint</li>
<li>Root vegetable</li>
<li>Leafless tree</li>
<li>Harp</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Splatter</li>
</ul>
<img src="uploads/2023/emoji2025.jpg" width="600" height="154" alt="New emojis for 2025">
<p>Leafless tree could apparently be used to represent a &ldquo;state of barrenness and death&rdquo; which feels very 2023 at least. Face with bags under eyes is surely another that contemporary times will inspire great use of. Unless of course by 2025 we either managed to fix the world or destroy it enough that all that remains of us is splatter .</p>

			 <p>Via some leaked documents the Observer got their hands on, we learn that the government is thinking about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/04/plans-to-redefine-extremism-would-include-undermining-uk-values">widening the formal definition of &lsquo;extremism&rsquo;</a> such that it&rsquo;ll read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremism is the promotion or advancement of any ideology which aims to overturn or undermine the UK&rsquo;s system of parliamentary democracy, its institutions and values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to be doing &lsquo;extremist things&rsquo; yourself. You might just not be disapproving of the folk that do hard enough.</p>
<p>Part of the definition that this Brave New World of people who spend their time <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/12/please-lets-not.html">sitting in other people&rsquo;s cars talking about freedom</a> and their friends will be considering, if the leak doesn&rsquo;t kill it, also includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustained support for, or continued uncritical association with organisations or individuals who are exhibiting extremist behaviours</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a slight worry that this blog, perhaps even this post, will become technically ripe for a referral to the anti-extremism authorities.</p>
<p>I mean, with the criteria of undermining &lsquo;the UK&rsquo;s system of parliamentary democracy&rsquo; featuring up top, might we be in theoretical trouble for having cast a vote in favour of changing the electoral system we vote under in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum">2011 national referendum</a>? What remains of <a href="https://tech.libdems.org.uk/news/article/proportional-representation-2">the Lib Dems</a> better watch out!</p>
<p>The various civil rights groups we have are rightly rather unhappy about this.</p>
<p>From the director of <a href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This proposed change would be a reckless and cynical move, threatening to significantly suppress freedom of expression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor of <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/">Index on Censorship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an unwarranted attack on freedom of expression and would potentially criminalise every student radical and revolutionary dissident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The racial justice director of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of extremism and its usage in counter-terrorism policies like [counter-terrorism strategy] Prevent is already being applied so broadly it seeks to effectively hinder people from organising and mobilising. The proposed definition takes this even further and could criminalise any dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leaked Govenrment document lists some organisations that they&rsquo;d consider as being &lsquo;captured&rsquo; by this proposed new definition. These include <a href="https://mcb.org.uk/">Muslim Council of Britain</a>, <a href="https://www.palestineaction.org/">Palestine Action</a> and <a href="https://www.mend.org.uk/">Muslim Engagement and Development</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the current definition of extremism we have is particularly narrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I suppose at least you have to be &lsquo;actively opposed&rsquo; at present. And, judging by the fact that more of our politicians aren&rsquo;t in extremism jail, it seems like at least the latter part of the definition isn&rsquo;t particularly strongly enforced.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s stopped <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-deeply-concerning-peaceful-climate-activists-were-referred-dubious-anti-terrorism">at least 45 peaceful environmental activists</a> being referred to the Government&rsquo;s current anti-extremism program. That situation that provoked Liberty to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/prevent-environment-animal-activists-referred-extremism">speak out once again</a> at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This reinforces long-held concerns that the government&rsquo;s staggeringly broad definition of extremism enables the police to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As ever, even if for some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/01/amnesty-calls-for-prevent-strategy-to-be-abolished-over-human-rights-abuses">absolutely inexplicable</a> reason you trust the current government and other arms of the state not to abuse the extraordinarily wide definitions of these very hot-button, very political, very emotional topics, one must remember that things change. Some even worse
folk could come along in the future. And it&rsquo;d be nice if they didn&rsquo;t automatically inherit the power to silence or punish anything that could be vaguely categorised as dissent against their preferences.</p>

			 <p>I often wondered what happened if you accidentally tick the &ldquo;Yes I have committed genocide&rdquo; box on the <a href="https://usa-esta.com/esta-resources/what-are-the-esta-eligibility-questions/">strange form</a> you&rsquo;re asked to fill in when travelling to the US.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, as part of the visa-waiver process to fly from the UK to the US you have to fill in your details and answer a series of increasingly harrowing questions, the apex of which is being asked to respond yes or no to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it turns out that inadvertently ticking the yes box has happened more than once so there&rsquo;s an answer. It seems to be more along the lines of subjecting you to hefty delays, cancellation and expensive bureaucratic hoops to jump through rather than getting thrown in jail. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s still annoying though.</p>
<p>Stories abound.</p>
<p>First <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45678517">there&rsquo;s Mandie</a> who encountered an obstacle in working through her bucket-list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cancer patient Mandie Stevenson had to postpone a bucket list trip to New York after she accidentally labelled herself a terrorist on her visa waiver form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then a prospective Christmas vacation was ruined for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/john-stevenson-us-visa-ban-terrorist-esta-form-mistake-a8660441.html">an older gentleman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Scottish couple&rsquo;s festive holiday plans are in disarray after a 70-year-old grandfather accidentally declared himself a terrorist on a crucial visa form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s now afraid he&rsquo;ll never be let in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They looked up my Esta number and said ‘you’re a terrorist’. I told them that I was 70 years old and I don’t even recognise what that means.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally for now we have someone at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/16/baby-us-embassy-interview-visa-esta-terrorist">the other end of the age spectrum</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A three-month old baby was summoned to the US embassy in London for an interview after his grandfather mistakenly identified him as a terrorist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But was it truly a mistake? Perhaps only mostly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s obviously never engaged in genocide, or espionage, but he has sabotaged quite a few nappies in his time, though I didn’t tell them that at the US embassy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>volunteered his grandfather.</p>

<p>I just discovered that <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/">Verso</a> appears to have a <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/pages/book-club">book club</a> that threatens to be extremely dangerous in terms of adding vast backlogs to the TBR list of anyone that way inclined.</p>
<p>From just £8 a month they send you copies of every new book they publish that month - or you can pay a bit more to get a couple of of physical books on top of that. So that&rsquo;s going to add 100 probably fairly heavy-going books per year to the now-entirely-detached-from-reality schedule.</p>

			 <p>What&rsquo;s going on in the Middle East at the moment - after Hamas committed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel">an appalling attack</a> on Israel and Israel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war">responded with an all-encompassing war</a> - feels too mind-bendingly awful to sensibly comment on.</p>
<p>But it is an extra shame to see how it, as world events often seem to do, translates to an senseless, pointless, futile increase in acts of criminal hatred and violence in faraway places.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/israel-palestine-hamas-gaza-london-hate-crime-b1116514.html">So far this month</a> there&rsquo;s been 174 incidents of Islamophobic crime recorded in London, which is an increase of 176% compared to the 65 reported in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The increase in anti-Semitic offences has been even higher. There&rsquo;s been 408 such offences recorded. That&rsquo;s an increase of almost 1400% compared to the 28 recorded in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The police have made 75 arrests so far that they say are linked to the conflict.</p>
<p>In general, crime report statistics are notoriously difficult to interpret. There are <a href="https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-accurate-are-british-crime-statistics-22462">many</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46894162">reasons</a> that crime report numbers can change that are unrelated to the number of crimes that actually took place. But these changes are so stark and so sadly explainable and predictable that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine this shift isn&rsquo;t real.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure no-one needs reminding, but today is <a href="https://www.moleday.org/">National Mole Day.</a> .

<img src="uploads/2023/nmd.jpg" width="400" height="446" alt="National Mole Day logo 2023">
<p>Rather it&rsquo;s a celebration of all things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Avagadro&rsquo;s Constant</a> from 6.02am through 6.02pm every October 23rd.</p>
<p>Avagadro&rsquo;s constant is 6.02 x 10^23 and thus on the date Americans call 10/23 at 6:02 it needs commemorating.</p>
<p>For anyone who forgot chemistry, per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Wikipedia</a> it&rsquo;s useful as a kind of conversion factor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Avogadro constant is also the factor that converts the average mass of one particle, in grams, to the molar mass of the substance, in grams per mole (g/mol)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s to say, given that a water molecule has a molar mass of 18  - the oxygen provides an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/atomic-weight">atomic weight</a> of 16, and each of the two hydrogen molecules contribute 1 extra - we define one mole of water as the amount of water that has a mass of 18 grams.  And to end up with 18 grams of water you need lots of water molecules, more specifically 6.02 x 10^23 of them.</p>
<p>In the same way if you wanted 16 grams of oxygen, you&rsquo;d need to find 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of it, and so on.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>TIL: The 2000 calories per day recommendation you see on food labels that say things like &ldquo;Eating this biscuit uses up 20% of your recommended daily calorie intake&rdquo; is not really based on a ton of rigorous science.</p>
<p>Rather, it seems to be a very rounded version of a wide-ranging number of calories that Americans reported eating on a survey from a few decades ago. So it more represents vaguely what the average person reported that ate 33 years ago than something that is in theory an actually recommendation for what you should eat.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-06-14/who-actually-needs-a-2-000-calorie-diet">US News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;.not only was the calorie standard not derived based on prevalent scientific equations that estimate energy needs based on age, height, weight and physical activity levels, but the levels were not even validated to ensure that the self-reported ranges were actually accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general I believe there&rsquo;s multiple studies out there that suggests that self-reported food consumption tends to systematically underestimate what was actually consumed - for example &ldquo;<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00090/full">Traditional Self-Reported Dietary Instruments Are Prone to Inaccuracies and New Approaches Are Needed</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plus people&rsquo;s needs vary a lot based on at least demographic and behavioural factors. There are plenty of people for which 2000 is substantially more than would be recommended if their goal was to maintain their current weight.</p>

			 <p>In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916221113759">recent paper</a>, researchers compared the trends in Google searches that suggest people are looking up the answer to the <a href="https://www.insider.com/wordle-game-viral-experts-psychology-sharing-twitter-2022-1">formerly-ubiquitous</a> word game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> with tweets from US players of the game.</p>
<p>An important note for the handful of people that don’t know how Wordle works is that if you lose the game then it tells you the answer, so I suppose the premise is that if you’re independently looking it up you must be up to no good.</p>
<p>The claim is that people who live in states that are more religious or &lsquo;culturally tight&rsquo; - having stricter, stronger, more enforced social norms - are less likely to cheat at Wordle.</p>
<p><a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/research-lead-who-cheats-at-wordle-the-case-for-critical-ignoring-building-a-rat-utopia-and-more/">Behavioralscienist.org</a> reproduces one of their charts.</p>

<p>Intuitively I feel like there’s plenty of other possible explanations for this pattern out there - the paper is paywalled so I haven’t read the full thing to know what else they considered and to what level of rigour.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, never trust an East Coast wordler I guess.</p>

			 <p>Can’t believe its taken me 7 years to learn of the outrageous decline of everyone’s favourite combination chocolate treat / weapon: the Terry’s Chocolate orange.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/chocorange.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chocolate orange">
<p>It’s been air-gapped!</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry%27s_Chocolate_Orange">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 29 May 2016, the UK product size was reduced from 175g to 157g by changing the moulded shape of each segment to leave an air gap between each piece.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess they thought noone would notice that the last two digits of the weight had been swapped around.</p>
<p>Compounding the crime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite this, the price doubled in some retail outlets.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to The Ezra Klein Show podcast episode &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ama-april2023.html">Why A.I. Might Not Take Your Job or Supercharge the Economy</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s spot on regarding the real AI alignment problem.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> that some super-powerful computer brain will eventually decide to remove the human race so it can get on with manufacturing paperclips. If anything remotely like that is a plausible scenario then of course we need to work on the knotty problem of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; AI alignment before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>But not at the expense of our present-day major AI-related alignment problem. Today&rsquo;s critical AI alignment problem is that the basic motivations of the organisations that develop, own and often hold some kind of monopoly over the most powerful AIs are usually not aligned with the public good in general, and almost never aligned with protecting or promoting the interests of the worst-off in society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, AI development is being driven principally by the question of can Microsoft beat Google to market? What does Meta think about all that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interests of companies, governments and some other types of institutions are not usually aligned with the interests of humanity as a whole.  I&rsquo;d probably generalise even further to say that the greater social and economic structures that most of us live under now are not aligned with the interests of the majority of the people enmeshed in them today, whether or not they may have served us well in some ways in the past.</p>
<p>Admittedly the veracity of these sorts of claims of course always depends on what you feel society should be optimised for, it&rsquo;s subjective rather than objective. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely to me that in a world where a primary motivation for the most cutting-edge AI development is something like &ldquo;How can Big Tech company X make a more impressive seeming and addictive chatbot than company Y such that its shareholders get richer faster?&rdquo; is likely to produce the best possible result in terms of maximising the benefits for almost any of humanity.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s main revenue stream remains advertising. Assuming that persists, I doubt society as a whole is going to benefit much by Google&rsquo;s brightest minds figuring out how to use these amazing new technologies to build better adverts, to make us click on more things we&rsquo;re not really interested in, more likely to buy things we don&rsquo;t really want.</p>
<p>Sure, the natural focus of these companies might help those who -  to borrow a famous phrase - own the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production">means of production</a> become ever more rich, ever more monopolistic, ever more exploitative. But beyond that why should we imagine that a product designed to make shareholders rich would be especially aligned with any other outcome?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not want the shape and pace of AI development to be decided by the competitive pressures between functionally three firms. I think the idea that we&rsquo;re going to leave this to Google, Meta and Microsoft is a kind of lunacy, like a societal lunacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generating extra money for rich people may not be the primary personal driver for developers in these fields. In fact I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not. No matter our job, few of us turn up each day exclusively motivated by the idea that by end of our workday we may have increased the wealth of some other firm&rsquo;s investment managers.</p>
<p>For a start, a certain type of person, me included, finds these technologies to be intrinsically interesting - witness the rapid development of open source alternatives to the big tech AI tools that have been rapidly developed by volunteers. Albeit volunteers that usually don&rsquo;t have access to anything like the massive resources that the Big Tech firms can bear to these tasks.</p>
<p>And if modern-day AI tools are as revolutionary as some believe then there&rsquo;s a huge amount of increased social good potentially within our grasp, especially if we believe that most people are fundamentally &ldquo;good&rdquo; in important ways. But people operate inside contexts that provide structures often far more powerful than the individual in terms of promoting their own rules, regulations, incentives and goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you have to actually ask as a society, what are you trying to achieve? What do you want from this technology?</p>
<p>If the only question here is what does Microsoft want from the technology? Or Google. That&rsquo;s stupid. That is us abdicating what we actually need to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this general idea doesn&rsquo;t only affect AI. It&rsquo;s a constant battle in the world of technology and beyond.</p>

			 <p>IPSO rules that the Mail on Sunday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/28/braverman-ethnicity-child-grooming-gangs-false-mail-on-sunday">must apologise</a> for publishing an article by Suella Braverman that claimed that almost all child grooming gangs in the UK are of British-Pakistani origin due to &lsquo;cultural attitudes completely incompatible with British values&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Our esteemed Home Secretary&rsquo;s claim is of course a lie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regulator said Braverman&rsquo;s decision to link &ldquo;the identified ethnic group and a particular form of offending was significantly misleading&rdquo; because the Home Office&rsquo;s own research had concluded offenders were mainly from white backgrounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel a tiny, tiny bit of sympathy for the paper in that apparently they did double-check the claim with the offices of the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister. And it&rsquo;d be sort of fair in a less ludicrous world to assume that any normal boss of a department wouldn&rsquo;t publicly and provably lie about about the research that their own department did. But by now we surely all know that we clearly don&rsquo;t live in that kind of world.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780525620785">Mexican Gothic</a> by Silvia Moreno-Garcia.</p>
<p>Rich young partygirl Noemi - more used to the 1950s Mexico City socialite scene than anything more gothic in nature -  is persuaded to go see what&rsquo;s up with her recently-married cousin Catalina after receiving a strange letter from her claiming that she&rsquo;s being poisoned and that her very house is filled with &ldquo;these restless dead, these ghosts, fleshless things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>No-one is takes these weird haunted house claims literally, although sure enough when she turns up the house is a big old isolated mansion, very creepy, rotting away, covered by mold and fungus. She meets a few inhabitants who are a bit weird, in similarly creepy, slightly stereotypical, ways.</p>
<p>But what about her previously well-adjusted cousin? Is she really being poisoned? Does she suffer from some malady, whether of the physical or mental realm? Or is her &ldquo;<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">I see dead people</a>&rdquo; (in walls) claim somehow the truth? Well, I&rsquo;m obviously not going to spoil that. Other than to say that what goes down is a bit grotesque in places, but suitably so.</p>
<p>If one wants to read a little more deeply and generally into the tale, there are obvious callouts to themes of female disempowerment, the colonisation mindset, the absolute exploitation of people deemed lesser than the (once) rich and powerful who have somehow managed to delude themselves into believing in their own innate superiority.</p>
<p>The house is a character unto itself, dark and isolating. Insanity - if that&rsquo;s what it is? -  confusion and disorientation prevail, with an increasing sense of dread. Many of the mainstays of gothic literature are to be found.  But even without the political analysis, I found it a compelling and creepy read.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/jury-duty">Jury Duty</a>.</p>
<p>Caved into the show that almost every American I know seems to be talking about. It&rsquo;s a reality gambit where they follow a guy who believes he&rsquo;s taking part in a documentary about how the US judicial system works from the point of view of being in the jury.</p>
<p>Only of course everyone else he encounters - the fellow jurists, the bailiffs, the judge, the complainant, defendant and their litigators - really everyone - are actors and the case is entirely fictional.</p>
<p>Of course semi-scripted hijinks ensue and we get to wonder if and at what point we might ever have realised what&rsquo;s going on had we been selected.</p>
<p>On the surface it seems like in Ronald Gladden they&rsquo;ve found the most amiable, well meaning, diligent and balanced person out there for their mark. Someone who might actually be able to handle every facet of his dutiful existence for a few weeks turning out to be entirely fake, a real life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show">Truman Show</a>.</p>
<p>Fervently hoping he won&rsquo;t end up being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck">milkshake duck</a>. And that the camera crews come back if he ever gets selected for jury duty for real. What would it take to convince him this time it&rsquo;s for real?</p>
<p>Oh - beware this paragraph might be a bit spoilery -  but I felt compelled to check and it turns out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soaking_(sexual_practice)">practice of soaking</a> isn&rsquo;t something the show invented. it&rsquo;s (probably) real courtesy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints amongst other <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/the-hook-up/soaking-mormon-sex-tiktok-viral-jump-humping/13572802">venerable institutions</a> .

			 <p>I was curious to know what age the oldest person to have ever lived got to. According to the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-person/">Guinness World Record folk</a> it&rsquo;s Jeanne Louise Calment, from France, who sadly died in 1997, aged 122.</p>

			 <p>Monopolies gonna monopoly. Now that Amazon is so dominant that many online retailers feel like they have no choice but to sell their products via them, Amazon squeezes them ever harder. At this point their fees represent <a href="https://ilsr.org/AmazonMonopolyTollbooth-2023/">almost half of the third-party sellers' revenue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first half of 2023, using a variety of fees, Amazon took 45 percent of sellers’ revenue in the U.S. That’s up from 35 percent in 2020, and 19 percent in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, most of those businesses go on to fail.</p>
<p>The three main categories of costs are the:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Referral fee: usually 15% of the revenue. This was previously the only or main cost charged to sellers for listing their products on Amazon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising fees: which counter to many people&rsquo;s intuition includes not only the more obvious adverts, but also the products Amazon highlights as &ldquo;highly rated&rdquo; and other such categories. You might think that the &ldquo;highly rated&rdquo; products are the products rated most highly on Amazon. But no - they&rsquo;re the products someone is willing to pay to be featured. The consequences of this also affect their placement in the general Amazon search results. Apparently most sellers feel like they have to use these features to stand a chance of getting sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fulfillment fees. These are charged for the privilege of having Amazon warehouse and ship your product. Most of the top sellers pay for this. Why? Because if not the products are not permitted to be eligible for Prime, which puts customers of - a new policy brought in 3 years ago.  Because running 2 fulfilment services is expensive this tends to mean suppliers send their non-Amazon originating orders through &ldquo;Fulfilled by Amazon&rdquo; too, again increasing their take.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon collects enough money from these fees - $82 billion in the first half of 2023  - such that it covers the entire cost of fulfilling both the third party orders and their own direct Amazon sales. Thus Amazon doesn&rsquo;t need to consider warehousing and shipping costs for their own products, because the money they charge third party sellers to cover their fulfilment costs in fact also pays for Amazon&rsquo;s own fulfilment costs. This is one reason why they can advantage themselves ever further by offering consumers lower prices than there is any hope that their rivals could match.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/amazonchart.jpg" width="400" height="1024" alt="">
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this next rule is legal, but sellers are also <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-09-21-amazons-185-billion-pay-to-play-system/">required to never charge less for their products on other sites than they do on Amazon</a> if they want to sell anything on Amazon.</p>
<p>This means that sellers can&rsquo;t pass the costs Amazon imposes on them to their own buyers who choose to use the Amazon ecosystem. Either they have to take the hit themselves, or they have to build the cost of operating with Amazon into the prices of every product they sell anywhere.  This then either results in the business having to raises their prices to consumers irrespective of whether Amazon was involved or not, or making it that extra bit less likely for the business to survive for long enough to become sustainable.</p>

			 <p>Brilliant.org has <a href="https://brilliant.org/lesson/the-overton-paradox/">a fun interactive explainer</a> of the Overton Paradox, at least as enacted in the US.</p>
<p>The paradox is as follows: Why is it that on average people are more likely to say that they&rsquo;re politically conservative when they get older, but yet when you ask them about their actual beliefs they appear to have become a little more liberal?</p>
<p>Along the way, we learn about the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-6179-7_88-1">difference between age effects and cohort effects</a>, which is important to understand in many domains of analysis.</p>
<p>Spoiler: the theory suggested is along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, people judge their left/right position relative to the perceived center of the population rather than by adherence to certain policy ideas.</li>
<li>The center has being trending more liberal over time, faster than the average drift an individual person makes over their lifetime.</li>
<li>Whilst both are likely real effects, the main driver of the centre shifting is the net replacement of older people of one generation, typically more conservative, with younger people from a newer one who are typically more liberal.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, each group, whether self-proclaimed conservative or liberal becomes more liberal as time goes on: a liberal from the 1970s has similar beliefs to a conservative from 2022. They&rsquo;ll just think they&rsquo;re more conservative because the baseline has changed.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>🎮 Currently playing <a href="https://polytopia.io/">The Battle of Polytopia</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/polytopia.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="The Battle of Polytopia logo">
<p>It&rsquo;s a world-domination strategy game vaguely along the lines of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civilisation game</a>. But far simpler to understand and much quicker to play.</p>
<p>You pick a tribe and are inserted into an unexplored territory of mystery, whereupon you gain the all-important points by exploring, researching, building up your towns and army, as well as potentially battling any opponents you come across who are doing the same. These can be computer enemies or there&rsquo;s also a human multi-player option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly playable on, and I think perhaps initially developed for, your phone. You can download it from the app stores for free and optionally choose to pay to be allowed to play as different tribes. But it&rsquo;s also there on Steam and some games consoles for the larger screen experience.</p>
<p>OK, it is Elon Musk&rsquo;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-lives-life-playing-222606578.html">favourite phone game</a>, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off.</p>
<p>The revelation that and his brother had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-ceo-lessons-brother-kimbal-polytopia-mobile-game-2023-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">conversations about the life lessons they learned from it</a> is pretty cringe though. Just for the record:</p>
<ol>
<li>Empathy is not an asset</li>
<li>Do not fear lose</li>
<li>Optimise every turn</li>
<li>Play life like a game</li>
<li>Be proactive</li>
<li>Double down</li>
<li>Pick your battles</li>
<li>Unplug at times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of those might explain a lot.  Don&rsquo;t worry though if you&rsquo;re a multiplayer fan. Apparently he had to stop playing at the point that he was so obsessed by it he started dreaming about it. By then it had <a href="https://gamingonphone.com/news/elon-musk-was-obsessed-with-the-battle-of-polytopia-mobile-game-reveals-his-recent-biography/">started making him late</a> for meetings and causing fights with his partner at the time, Grimes.</p>
<p>So far I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <em>entirely</em> drained me of empathy.</p>

			 <p>My Microsoft Surface laptop decided not to recognise that anything was plugged into its USB ports today. No idea why. But this meant I couldn&rsquo;t charge it or use the vast array of bits and pieces I have plugged into its dock. No amount of cable swapping or rebooting helped.</p>
<p>What eventually solved it, thanks to a tip from a colleague, was to shut down the laptop and unplug the USB-C cable. Then to hold the power button for 20 seconds until the Windows logo appeared, went away, and appeared once more. Once the computer finished loading up the USB-C charger and everything else that was plugged into it worked just fine.</p>
<p>No idea why it worked, but it did.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://www.thestudiesshowpod.com/">The Studies Show</a> podcast.</p>
<p>A couple of science writers I&rsquo;ve followed for a while, Tom Chivers and Stuart Ritchie, get together once a week to discuss some vaguely controversial scientific issue.</p>
<p>Are there studies supporting the clickbait headlines? What do the research papers cited by reporters and authors in support of a proposition actually say? Were they any good in the first place?</p>
<p>To give a flavour of what goes down, their first few episodes were about the GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs, breastfeeding, aspartame and psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not overly hard going. If you have a passing interest in reading newspaper science sections or popular science books then you&rsquo;ll do fine here.</p>
<p>What I have to call out for special credit is that the shownotes from each episode give the actual references and links to the papers they discuss. Of course this shouldn&rsquo;t be remarkable for a podcast that is entirely about scientific studies.  But there seem to be many other &lsquo;science&rsquo; shows out there that make it unnecessarily challenging to figure out exactly where they&rsquo;re pulling their information from that, even now, it&rsquo;s a real treat to see the sources shared up-front</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Last week, while checking the device of an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization with international offices, Citizen Lab found an actively exploited zero-click vulnerability being used to deliver NSO Group’s Pegasus mercenary spyware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">Citizen Lab reports</a> the discovery of the ominous sounding &lsquo;Blastpass&rsquo;. This is a bug in the operating system of most Apple devices that allows someone to infect your phone with spyware simply by messaging you a special image. The recipient doesn&rsquo;t have to click on anything.</p>
<p>It reminds me of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">that time in 2019</a> where users of WhatsApp on both iOS and Android devices could be infected via receiving a WhatsApp call, even if they didn&rsquo;t answer it.</p>
<p>Back then, a lawsuit alleged that at least 1400 people were subjected to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over an 11-day span in late April and early May, the suit alleges, NSO targeted about 1,400 mobile phones that belonged to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to what the above implies, the feeling seems to be that probably for now if you&rsquo;re not someone being personally targeted by an extremely resourceful adversary then you&rsquo;re probably OK. But still, best to upgrade to iOS 16.6.1 or put your phone into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650">lockdown mode</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/09/15/liz-truss-is.html">Liz Truss is writing a new book 😟</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After winning the record for being <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/20/liz-truss-finally.html">the only UK Prime Minister</a> with a shorter lifespan than <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/21/so-the-lettuce.html">a lettuce</a> - and perhaps one of the most incompetent ones although the last few years have made that quite a competition - Liz Truss is back on the scene with a new book soon to come out called&hellip;drum roll&hellip;&quot;<a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/truss-newsworthy-debut-goes-to-biteback">Ten Years to Save the West</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>It sounds like it&rsquo;s exactly what you would guess from a title so trite and overdramatic it&rsquo;ll make your eyes roll right out of your face. Yes, despite the fact that the UK has had a ludicrously performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">government of the right</a> for the past 13 - <a href="https://www.history.com/news/whats-so-unlucky-about-the-number-13">unlucky for some</a> -  years, apparently it&rsquo;s all those sneaky communists (?) that are ruining everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the rise of authoritarianism around the world and the adoption of fashionable ideas propagated by the global left give us barely a decade to preserve the economic and cultural freedom and institutions that the West holds so dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely unsurprisingly it seems like it&rsquo;ll contain a good amount of that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/vote-me-get-thatcher-why-the-tories-are-still-obsessed-with-the-iron-lady"> favourite hobby</a> of the modern-day Conservative cosplayer: heart-felt worship of Thatcher.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday <a href="https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-12499369/Liz-Truss-reveal-inside-story-49-day-premiership-new-book-including-meeting-Queen-just-hours-monarch-died.html">shares an interview</a>, which even they seem to feel is a bit of a wild one at times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting incongruously beneath a picture of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara bizarrely blended with Lord Nelson – a nod by Norfolk MP Ms Truss to the county’s most famous son – she launches a passionate defence of her own attempted revolution, which died when the markets crashed in the wake of her radical tax-cutting Budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was she such a failure? Not because, heaven forbid, she made any serious missteps in her short reign of power. It&rsquo;s <em>everyone else&rsquo;s</em> fault for not loving her ideas enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the fundamental problem was there wasn’t enough support for Conservative ideas&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from, once again, a very much majority Conservative government she was part of.</p>
<p>Tin foil hat time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the ‘global Left’ were in control. ‘Ideas like redistributionism, business being bad, the anti-growth people like Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil – those are the ideas that have made the running in the last decade,’ she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sure, everyone loves Extinction Rebellion and hates businesses too much. Those closet Commies are just&hellip;.something something&hellip;such that it simply <em>appears</em> that <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/explore/not-for-profit/Extinction_Rebellion">people dislike ER</a> and the British titans of business are getting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/07/ftse-100-executive-pay-rose-23-per-cent-4m-2022">unspeakably richer each day</a> whilst everyone else sits in a cost of living crisis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You’ve got the global Left which Biden is obviously a key part of, but also the global environmental movement, the Greta Thunbergs of this world, the anti-capitalist movement, and they have been very effective in pushing what is politically acceptable.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I missed the news that Greta is the current PM of the UK and that capitalism has been overthrown. Presumably the state now owns the means of production I&rsquo;m typing this on. I mean, some would say that her desperate premiership did more than the rest of us combined to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism">discredit free market economics</a> and their animal spirits. They certainly didn&rsquo;t like her; the <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23007757.liz-truss-kwasi-kwarteng-wrecked-uk-economy-seven-days/">crashing of the British economy</a> being of course much of the reason she had to go.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also actively campaigning for &ldquo;a Republican&rdquo; to win the next US election, which is perhaps a little surprising after the fuss her treasured Boris made about &ldquo;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/472428-trump-well-aware-of-boris-johnsons-request-to-not-interfere-in-uk/">allies and friends&rdquo; getting involved</a> in each other&rsquo;s election campaigns.</p>
<p>Inevitably the typical new-levels-of-desperation-provoked Conservative fixation on US-style <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/liz-truss-diverse-cabinet-culture-war-unlike-any-other-1836651">culture war issues</a> raise their head. She&rsquo;s apparently terrified that the West is about to be destroyed whilst &ldquo;our culture is being questioned, even basic things like human biology&rdquo;. We all know what that means.</p>
<p>Mainly that it&rsquo;s probably only a matter of time before she starts a Substack and appears on multi-hour Qanon-adjacent podcasts to complain about terrible being cancelled was, albeit the kind of cancellation that involves &ldquo;the left&rdquo; mind-controlling you to choose to resign from literally running the country and write a book whilst earning <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-earns-16500-per-29784243">£16,500 per hour</a> for making speeches.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to Hell Is A Teenage Girl by <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1693992081">Nessa Barrett</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/hiatg.png" width="252" height="252" alt="">
<p>Nessa is a Tiktok star. Perhaps a true emissary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Gen Z</a> with possibly the somewhat <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/nessa-barrett-interview-hell-is-a-teenage-girl-tiktok-religion-mental-health-cover-story">stereotypical Gen Z habits</a> of spending time staying in writing in her gratitude journal and doing tarot alongside her cat whilst releasing TikTok videos rather than the again stereotypical debauched and drunken lifestyles of such stars in former generations</p>
<p>Some of her ability to attract an incredible number of fans likely comes from her openness about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessa_Barrett#Personal_life">her mental health problems</a>. Sadly it sounds like she&rsquo;s suffered tremendously from a range of conditions.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also musically talented enough that posting her vids on TikTok led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>I think I read somewhere that the concept behind much of this EP is to enumerate the stages one goes through after a rough relationship breakup - the incompatible thoughts one might have: reminiscing, happy memories, disgust, hatred, caring nothing, caring too much. Aspects of it remind me of several other artists, from Taylor Swift to Girl In Red; the last song giving me the vibes a somewhat less intense version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh8Gl2GwB6s">Serotonin</a>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz Picard</a> is a great utility to clean up your computerised music collection if like me you are old and lazy enough to have the occasional folder of MP3s (or other audio formats) ripped from CDs years ago which you cunningly named &ldquo;track1.mp3&rdquo;, &ldquo;track2.mp3&rdquo; whilst not bothering to add any title or artist metadata. Or if you&rsquo;re the type to get deep into tagging precisely which edition of which thing published where your music is.</p>
<p>You just tell the software where your tracks are and it tries to recognise them in a couple of ways. It can go by their <a href="https://acoustid.org/">AcoustID fingerprint</a> if there is no metadata - meaning it can work even if you haven&rsquo;t got a clue what or where your file came from.</p>
<p>If it can&rsquo;t figure it out automatically then if you do know what album or song it probably should be it allows you to manually search the database for it in your browser. No matter how you proceed, it&rsquo;ll later provide an indication of how confident it is in the matches based on things like track length.</p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s all down, hit save, and your files will be rewritten with the appropriate metadata taken from the incredible <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz database</a>, and renamed nicely if you select the appropriate option.</p>
<p>If your files are obscure enough to not be in the MusicBrainz database then I guess you&rsquo;ll have no luck. But I haven&rsquo;t encountered this yet.</p>
<p>The only minor problem I&rsquo;ve had is when it identified my music as being a release of the correct album but in another country. No big deal if you&rsquo;re not a perfectionist - but if you want the exact right cover and publication metadata then that was easily fixed by using the manual search feature which lets you pick specific country releases.</p>

			 <p>Another day, another mass data-leak. The one that caught my attention most recently was that the details of 2.6 million <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> users were <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scraped-data-of-26-million-duolingo-users-released-on-hacking-forum/">for sale on hacking forums</a>. To be fair, it looks to be less &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; and more a product of misusing the DuoLingo API in order to collect data that could include people&rsquo;s real name, email address and some DuoLingo specifics such as what language the user was learning, as well as some profile settings.</p>
<p>Much of this except email address was technically &ldquo;public&rdquo; in that you could see it on a user&rsquo;s profile or at least access it via the API. But by feeding the API a big list of email addresses, probably obtained from some other leak, one could confirm their association with a DuoLingo account. This join to email gives an obvious opening for scammers to send accurately personalised spams or phishes - &ldquo;Hey, to continue your French lessons we need you to re-enter your credit card details here&rdquo; type stuff.</p>
<p>As it happens I <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2021/08/15/accessing-your-duolingo-data-for-analysis-via-python/">wrote about one way to programmatically access your data</a> from DuoLingo the past. But there I promise that I was more interested in the data of my on progress rather getting everyone&rsquo;s data to sell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only because <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/06/01/amazing-how-unproficient.html">I&rsquo;ve used DuoLingo</a> that this stood out to me I guess. It&rsquo;s far from the worst leak in recent times. Just this month we&rsquo;ve seen details of 40 million UK folk <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/08/turns-out-the.html">leak from the UK Electoral Commission</a>,  details of <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/discord-io-shut-down-data-breach-hacking-b1101000.html">760000 Discord.io users  released</a> (enough to <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/148221/discordio-temporarily-shuts-down-after-hack-promises-security-overhaul">shut the site down</a> for now) and 10 million French residents exposed via <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/10-million-likely-impacted-by-data-breach-at-french-unemployment-agency/">a leak from their government&rsquo;s unemployment registration agency</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s feeling ever more like if anything related to you is on any computer connected to the internet anywhere in some form other than heavily encrypted then you might consider it could potentially become public one day. In some cases <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/21/twitters-habit-of.html">even if you explicitly deleted it years ago</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/09/04/q-by-christine.html">Q by Christine Dalcher reminds us of the dangers of taking meritocracy too far</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008303365">Q</a> by Christina Dalcher.</p>
<p>Set in in a United States of the (near?) future, this book imagines a society where your status, what you&rsquo;re allowed to do, what access you have to things, even where you must be is governed by your &ldquo;Q&rdquo; score. Q is a kind of measure of intelligence, ability and moral worth. It can be thought of as an enhanced social credit score,  a quantified meritocracy.</p>
<p>Life can be very good for those with high Q. At least materially; the threat of losing one&rsquo;s position is of course ever-present. But the experience is grim for those who have been tarred with the brush of having a naturally low Q.</p>
<p>The book tells of the experience of Elena, a mother who has two children with very different Qs.</p>
<p>The story goes that she herself was very influential in the development of the Q system. The slightly incredible suggestion is that it originated from a system she and others got instigated at their school when they were students to help them cope with the relentless bullying in the before-times. Today though any concerns of bullying are gone; she&rsquo;s a respected lecturer, high Q. Her husband is a high-up government official largely in charge of managing the Q system. They lead an easy life of relative luxury. In some ways, the Q system is their doing and they certainly benefit from it.</p>
<p>Until they don&rsquo;t, or at least Elena doesn&rsquo;t. Her callous husband cares little for their child with insufficient Q. The powerful in society certainly don&rsquo;t care at all. But, hey, it&rsquo;s OK. Every child has a place. Trying not to spoil anything, it&rsquo;s just not a place Elena wants her child to go. And her new need to dig into the workings of the system lead her to discover the twisted goal it&rsquo;s taken on and the horrific methods that it uses to that end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a subtle book. There are plenty of vibes of things that exist today. The Chinese <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained">social credit system</a> comes to mind, as does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)#Plot">&ldquo;Nosedive&rdquo; Black Mirror episode</a>. More generally ,the pernicious inequalities foist upon us all depending on what the society you happen to be in today values and permits - witness the semi-panic in the recent AI hype cycle where folk with reasonably high-status jobs worry that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02?r=US&amp;IR=T#media-jobs-advertising-content-creation-technical-writing-journalism-2">they&rsquo;ll be replaced</a> with a computer - and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-index-of-economic-marginalisation-helps-explain-trump-brexit-and-alt-right-71172">politics that follows</a>..</p>
<p>The stratification of modern-day schooling and with a potential <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/17/11/when-testing-takes-over">over-emphasis on tests</a> is already a part of today&rsquo;s world in many places. As is a veneration of a meritocracy that doesn&rsquo;t really think through its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/06/michael-sandel-the-populist-backlash-has-been-a-revolt-against-the-tyranny-of-merit">more problematic consequences</a>. Genetic engineering and its consequent potential for selecting the attributes of future babies are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-era-of-designer-babies-may-be-based-on-overhyped-science/">work in progress</a>. And we should never forget the still frequently overlooked history of the role that eugenicists have played in the United States - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/24/521360544/the-supreme-court-ruling-that-led-to-70-000-forced-sterilizations">Three generations of imbeciles are enough</a>&rdquo; - and elsewhere, including of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics">most infamous instantiation of all</a>.</p>

			 <p>Last week I got to go experience the <a href="https://dreamachine.world/">Dream Machine</a> with a friend. The nature of the experience is such that I think it'&rsquo;ll be extraordinarily hard to convey via text, but I&rsquo;ll give it at least a weak go.</p>
<p>The overall conceit of the project is that when placed in a dark room, a mix of flashing lights and sounds can alter your conscious experience. Or rather it  &ldquo;invites you on a magical journey to explore the extraordinary potential of your mind&rdquo; to quote their website.</p>
<p>First up you start off in a room where past participants have attempted to draw what they experienced. You get to do the same when you&rsquo;re done, although my art skills are such that I didn&rsquo;t even try. Many of these pictures resemble colourful geometric patterns or bright fields of light. A handful appear to contain human-looking objects, perhaps aliens, that kind of thing, especially exciting to me. You can see some of these <a href="https://dreamachine.world/dream-grid/">pictures on their their website</a>. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/dreammachine.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="Picture of what someone saw in the Dream Machine">
<p>Next up they relieve you of your phone and other devices and, unexpectedly, your shoes. You&rsquo;re issued a bag that contains some hotel-style slippers, an eye mask and a blanket. There&rsquo;s a short safety talk to check everyone&rsquo;s willing and ready. The default experience is not suitable for people with sensitivity to flashing lights (precluding folk with some forms of epilepsy) or loud sounds. But they do have modified experiences available that should allow most people with those sensitivities to proceed if you let them know that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re led into a kind of inside tent with maybe 10-12 people to sit space d out on a large circular sofa type thing. The back of it is slanted such that you&rsquo;re half lying down. Two speakers surround your head. There&rsquo;s a big white spherical thing on the ceiling, which is the soon-to-be-flashing light. Your bag&rsquo;s blanket is for if you&rsquo;re a bit cold. The eye-mask is for you to put on if the experience starts to feel temporarily too much.</p>
<p>More safety briefing and confirmations that one is ready to proceed are given. Whilst the supervisors aren&rsquo;t going to be in the room with you when the experience starts they must be watching you I suppose as the deal is that if you need help you should wave and they&rsquo;ll come help you. All this is either a bit off-putting or a bit exciting depending your constitution, I definitely felt the latter.</p>
<p>Two key facts include that 1) you should keep your eyes shut throughout the experience if you can and 2) no matter what you think is going on out there they promise that all they&rsquo;re actually doing is flashing a white light at various intervals. Anything else you perceive is coming entirely from the mysterious world of your brain.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a little taster session just to make sure everyone is OK with the actual experience rather than a description of it. The room goes dark, you close your eyes and a prerecorded audio grounding starts. If you&rsquo;ve done certain types of meditation (including the app types) it&rsquo;s that kind of thing. Focus on your breath, your body, and so on. Then the sounds start, slightly ethereal music for the most part. And through your closed eyes you can tell the light must be turning on as a kind of brightness changes your eye-closed perception, similarly to how you know whether it&rsquo;s a sunny day or the middle of the night when you wake up each day but can&rsquo;t be bothered to open your eyes.</p>
<p>Then a few minutes of presumably flickering lights, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, wherein you get a taste of what&rsquo;s to come. The taster experience soon ends. The supervisors return and check that everyone is fine to proceed. Everyone was, so the main experience begins, again with the grounding.</p>
<p>This main course is a lot longer. I&rsquo;m not actually sure how long. Maybe 20 minutes? It&rsquo;s not like us humans are particularly good at keeping track of time in our heads even when at our most connected to stark reality, which in this experience is not really the case.</p>
<p>The sounds start, the light flashes, on and off, fast and slow, and your mind does what it does. Which in my case was mostly giving me visions of animated geometric patterns. Sometimes white, in line with the white light that we&rsquo;re told is the entirety of the external generative process. Sometimes not. Deep reds, yellows and oranges filled my inner eye at times.</p>
<p>These were usually organised into field-of-perceived-vision-encompassing dots, hexagons, and a repeating motif of diamonds. They zoomed in and out, they swirled, transitioning more intensely from one to another than even the best PowerPoint could. They exploded. They shrunk into nothingness. At first I felt just a little stressed or even nauseous perhaps, but it didn&rsquo;t last long and I relaxed into it to enjoy the perception show.</p>
<p>At one point I kind of felt like I saw a face in the centre of my vision - an alien? A God? Who knows? - but as much as I tried to focus and keep the glowing white visage present within the vision, the surrounding burning-white pulsating diamonds suddenly expanded and occluded the face within seconds.</p>
<p>So all in all, a lot was going on. Time flew, and I was not really ready to stop when unfortunately it was time for the experience to end. At that point you leave into a far more normal room with the possibility to draw something of your experience, write about it or just chat around a literal watercooler.</p>
<p>It was my friend&rsquo;s second time at this kind of show, so one of my immediate questions could be answered. Apparently no, you do not see the same thing each time you do it. And also, as intuitively would be the case, not everyone sees the same things. You are to be silent during the experience so there&rsquo;s no real way of communicating live what&rsquo;s going on in your head, and maybe it&rsquo;d ruin the experience if you tried to do so. But for sure we saw different things; deep blues for her if I remember correctly, reds for me. Assuming we mean the same things with the same words, that classical challenging <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/color/#H3">philosophical problem</a>. I expect humanity&rsquo;s inner mental lives are as diverse as their outer characteristics.</p>
<p>Tickets are currently £15 and you&rsquo;d need to get yourself to Hackney, London - everything you need to sign up is <a href="https://dreamachine.world/studio-dreamachine/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: apparently this was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/dreamachine-unboxed-brion-gysin-jon-hopkins-assemble">originally designed</a> as part of the Festival of Brexit (aka &ldquo;Unboxed&rdquo; but the former name is much funnier). It&rsquo;s not an original observation, but there are certainly plenty of folk out there who think that anything designed to alter your consciousness in any direction away from the grim reality of contemporary Britain is the best that we can really hope for to be fair. The Government&rsquo;s DCMS committee said the whole thing was an &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit/952349/festival-of-brexit-unboxed">irresponsible use of public money</a>&rdquo;. The festival of course, not Brexit, definitely not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much earlier inspiration <a href="https://dreamachine.world/about/">comes from</a> work by an artist called <a href="https://www.briongysin.com/">Brion Gysin</a>. In 1959 he made a much smaller device that used flickering light to create &ldquo;vivid illusions&rdquo; in the minds of those who experienced it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of it taken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gatewood">Charles Gatewood</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/ogdreammachine.jpeg" width="474" height="266" alt="The original Dream Machine">
<p>Gysin designed it after noticing that the flickering of sunlight when driving through trees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/dreamachine-unboxed-brion-gysin-jon-hopkins-assemble">put him into a somewhat hallucinatory state</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dreamachine would awaken humanity, Gysin hoped, from cultural stupefaction and liberate us from being passive consumers of mass-produced imagery. Gysin hoped it would replace every TV in every home in the US and make us creators of our own cinematic experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that that&rsquo;s not quite what ended up happening. But I&rsquo;m glad its derivatives are still around for us to experience all these years later.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/27/the-trials-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-08-27 15:05:54 &#43;0000">Aug 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past couple of days I&rsquo;ve managed to install <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/07/the-call-of.html">Linux Mint</a> onto my Windows 10 computer. The last straw for Windows was when <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/">it advertised</a> some story about how great Wetherspoons is to me when all I wanted to do was open some software. My computer also is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/">prohibited by Microsoft</a> from upgrading to Windows 11 (it is old&hellip;but runs Windows 10 just fine) so at some point in the possibly distant future I imagine that could have caused me a problem. I&rsquo;d also like to move more and more towards open source software, at least for my personal computing.</p>
<p>Below is what I did. It didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as I&rsquo;d hoped to be honest. I probably made it more difficult than I needed to for myself to be fair, and Windows played tricks on me too. But in the end it seems to be working well I&rsquo;m writing it here in case I need to do it again or someone else encounters the same obstacles.</p>
<p>So there are various ways you can install Linux Mint on a computer that currently has Windows on it. That includes starting afresh, deleting everything you already have, Windows and all, and going 100% Linux. You can also use Linux Mint inside Windows using a virtual machine without having to do anything to Windows - it acts just like another piece of software you install in Windows, but has the obvious memory and processing overhead of having to run Windows and Linux simultaneously. You can also use it entirely from a USB drive. But I chose to go with probably the trickiest of options dual-booting.</p>
<p>The idea here is that in the end what should happen is that each time my computer turns on it gives me a menu letting me choose whether I want to use Windows or Linux. I thus can choose between Windows and Linux each run and they&rsquo;ll act independently of each other. The natural cost is that you need to dedicate a certain amount of disk space to both operating systems and any files you want to use in them - but it&rsquo;s better than having to buy a whole new computer. It&rsquo;s also proved more tricky to set up than I imagine the other options would have been, although I do lay some of the blame at Windows' feet whilst  sucking up a decent chunk of it as being down to my own ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="get-and-validate-the-linux-mint-install-software">Get and validate the Linux Mint install software</h2>
<p>Step 1 was to <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/choose.html">download</a> the ISO file containing the Linux Mint image I wanted to install. I went with the &ldquo;Cinnamon 64bit&rdquo; version. Also get the sha256sum.txt and sha256sum.txt.gpg files from relevant Linux Mint download page (<a href="https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=305">this</a> was the edition I used) which lets us verify the integrity of the ISO file later.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, verify the file by comparing hashes. I only had access to Windows so per <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=291093">these instructions</a> I downloaded <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> - the &ldquo;Simple installer for the current Gnu PG&rdquo; from <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then to check the integrity if the ISO:</p>
<p>Open a command prompt (PowerShell) in the folder I downloaded those to and ran 
<code>CertUtil -hashfile linuxmint-21.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso SHA256</code></p>
<p>Check that the results matched the sha256sum.txt file.</p>
<p>To check authenticity:</p>
<p>Run <code>gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-key 27DEB15644C6B3CF3BD7D291300F846BA25BAE09</code></p>
<p>Then:
<code>gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt</code></p>
<p>And check that the output says &ldquo;Good signature from &ldquo;Linux Mint ISO Signing Key <a href="mailto:root@linuxmint.com">root@linuxmint.com</a>&rdquo; and the primary key fingerprint at the bottom matches the 27DE&hellip;. code from the first <code>gpg</code> output. Don&rsquo;t worry about the warning about the key not being certified.</p>
<h2 id="make-a-bootable-linux-usb-stick">Make a bootable Linux USB stick</h2>
<p>Now we need to to make a bootable USB stick from the ISO image. First find a USB disk you don&rsquo;t mind emptying out as this will remove any existing files on it. After that, <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html">here are the instructions</a>.  For Windows they suggest you install <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Etcher</a>. I downloaded Etcher for Windows Portable Edition but presumably any should work.</p>
<p>In Etcher, choose to &ldquo;Flash from file&rdquo; and select the ISO image you downloaded in the first step.
Then &ldquo;Select Target&rdquo; to choose your USB drive (after plugging it in, and remembering that you&rsquo;ll lose any data on it). Then select to flash the drive and wait a few minutes until it’s finished.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-disk-space-for-linux-to-install-to">Prepare disk space for Linux to install to</h2>
<p>Next up we&rsquo;ll need to create a partition for Linux Mint to install to. Probably your disk is already partitioned 100% for Windows. I needed to reduce the size of the Windows partition and create a new one with space from Linux.</p>
<p>Although the instructions for Linux Mint read to me like you can do this during the Linux Mint install process, most of the info I read on the internet suggested to do it first in Windows, with the Windows specific tool, given you&rsquo;re messing around with a Windows partition. This is &ldquo;fiddling around with hard disks&rdquo; type stuff, so everyone recommends that you back up anything important before doing it just in case either you or Windows does it wrong and lose it all.</p>
<p>Then I did the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the built-in app &ldquo;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-in-disk-management-ad88ba19-f0d3-0809-7889-830f63e94405">Disk Management</a>&rdquo; in Windows - one way to get to this is open the Start Menu and start typing &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; until the option to &ldquo;Create and format hard disk partitions&rdquo; comes up.</li>
<li>Right click the disk you want to &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; in order to make a Linux partition. For me this was the one labelled &ldquo;C:&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;Shrink volume&rdquo;</li>
<li>It asks you to input the &ldquo;amount of space to shrink&rdquo; in MB. I decided to give Linux 100GB to use for now so typed in 100000 and clicked &ldquo;Shrink&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A while later the Disk Management screen updated to show a 97.66GB unallocated space. Seems like I should have remembered that 100000 MB doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equal 100 GB if I wanted rounder numbers. But this will do for now.</li>
<li>Note that of course whatever you &ldquo;unallocate&rdquo; here won&rsquo;t be accessible to Windows. So you need to have a decent amount of free disk space to go this dual boot way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reboot-from-your-usb-drive">Reboot from your USB drive</h2>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to boot up the bootable USB we created and install Linux into this free space.</p>
<p>First I checked the BIOS to make sure my computer could boot from a USB. For my old Sony laptop this meant turning it off and then holding down the special button marked &ldquo;ASSIST&rdquo; and choosing &ldquo;Start from media&rdquo;. For most less weirdly proprietary computers I think that&rsquo;s usually case of looking at your <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings">BIOS settings</a> to make sure your computer is set to boot from USB drive before your hard disk and then rebooting it.</p>
<p>Start it up again with the USB drive you prepared earlier plugged in. If you set the boot options correctly you will get a menu. I chose &lsquo;Start Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon 64-bit&rsquo;’'.</p>
<h2 id="start-the-linux-mint-installation-wizard">Start the Linux Mint installation wizard</h2>
<p>After a few minutes and some slightly scary looking error messages I ignored it loaded up to a Linux Mint desktop. I double clicked the Install Linux Mint icon.</p>
<p>In the subsequent wizards, select your language, keyboard. I chose the option to ‘Install multimedia codecs’ which meant I had to configure secure boot by choosing a password as  I apparently have UEFI secure boot enabled.</p>
<p>I think this stage later gave me problems. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure this is why but I read somewhere that your keyboard will effectively be in US mode at the time of needing this password. So if you have a non-US keyboard then you might want to make the password pretty simple and not full of special characters. Letters and numbers worked for me. Note that you only need to use this password once.</p>
<p>Next up in the install wizard, I chose &ldquo;Install Linux mint alongside windows boot manager&rdquo;. A message popped up explaining what changes it was going to make. It wasn’t all that helpful. But I <em>think</em> it did everything OK.  There is a &ldquo;Something else&rdquo; option if you prefer to try and manually figure out / exert some control your partitions. Most internet guides seem to recommend that, but I must admit I did the &ldquo;install alongside&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>Next up I chose my time zone, and chose a username, password, computer name and chose to encrypt my home folder. This password is the one you&rsquo;ll use to log onto Linux Mint every time so make sure you can remember it. The system then started to install.</p>
<p>I then let it restart the computer, removing the USB when it told me too.</p>
<h2 id="manage-your-moks-">Manage your MOKs (?)</h2>
<p>A blue &ldquo;MOK management&rdquo; screen appeared. I had no idea what this meant. I think what I should have done was to choose the &ldquo;Enroll MOK&rdquo; which was the second option I was presented with, view the key and choose to &ldquo;Enroll key&rdquo;. The password is the first password we recorded above, the one to do with the multimedia codecs.</p>
<p>However I had little idea what any of this meant so by the time I got to it it had timed out and automatically picked the first option which was to continue the normal boot process. This loaded up Linux Mint but I&rsquo;m led to believe this meant the multimedia codecs and maybe some other stuff wouldn&rsquo;t work. You really want to enroll the MOK.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a one time prompt - reboot and you&rsquo;ll not get a chance to enroll the MOK key again. Oh no! But there is a way to reset this and get the MOK key prompt to come back.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-mok-enrollment-screen-to-come-back-if-like-me-you-did-it-wrong-the-first-time">Getting the MOK enrollment screen to come back if like me you did it wrong the first time</h3>
<p>Thank you to Philip from the 11th post <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/701448">here</a> who documented that if you load up to Linux and type this into the command prompt:</p>
<p><code>sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der</code></p>
<p>Then the next time you restart you&rsquo;ll get that option to Enroll MOK again. Running the above will ask perhaps for your &ldquo;root&rdquo; password which is the second one you selected above and then for you to define a new password. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of the one-use first password we encountered above with the multimedia codecs. So probably make it fairly simple. It won&rsquo;t affect the password you log onto your computer with. But it&rsquo;s this one-use password you use to enroll your MOK.</p>
<p>If feeling particularly committed, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot">this page</a> describes a bit more about what these keys and commands are for. If your computer isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; with SecureBoot then you may not see any of this.</p>
<p>After that, all seemed well. Whenever I turned my computer on I could choose between Linux and Windows just like I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-internet">Connecting to the internet</h2>
<p>At first the wifi didn&rsquo;t work, but once I went into the built-in Driver Manager in Linux Mint and inserted my install USB key when prompted. It scanned, found my wireless card, and when I selected the only option it gave me other than &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it&rdquo; that all started working well.</p>
<h2 id="when-windows-forcibly-takes-over-again">When Windows forcibly takes over again</h2>
<p>I was glowing with success only for a few minutes until Windows turned nasty&hellip;.The first time I chose to load Windows it appeared to overwrite the startup menu where you choose between Linux and Windows. Apparently this is pretty normal. I guess Windows just can&rsquo;t believe that you don&rsquo;t want to 100% use it and its extremely undesirable Start Menu.</p>
<p>So whilst I&rsquo;d successfully installed Linux Mint, after the first time I&rsquo;d loaded up Windows I wasn&rsquo;t given the option to actually use Linux ever again. Aaargh.</p>
<p>The internet has a vast array of frustrated users and posts with helpful suggestions about what lengthy thing you should type in to where to hopefully sort this problem out. But not a single one of the ones I saw quite worked for me. However they did provide enough clues that I think I eventually got to  the bottom of it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I fully understand everything I did here, and it&rsquo;s probably not very risk free for anyone with no backup, but here&rsquo;s what worked for me in case I ever need it again. Honestly though, unless you understand it better than me I wouldn&rsquo;t run it without having a great backup, a bit more research or an expert friend.</p>
<p>First up, you&rsquo;ll need to get back into Linux however you can (remember you can most likely boot from your install USB if you&rsquo;ve no other way). Then open the command prompt (aka terminal) and run:</p>
<p><code>efibootmgr -v</code></p>
<p>I got a list showing the partitions that could boot and thee order that they&rsquo;d apparently do so in. One row for Windows and a couple for &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo;. One of these rows was my main Linux Mint install. The other is &ldquo;grub&rdquo; which is the menu system that lets you choose which OS to start when you turn your computer. Windows kept insisting on enabling itself and acting like it was first on the list no matter what I did whereas I needed the grub one to take precedence. The intuitive thing of &ldquo;change the boot order to the order you want it to be in&rdquo; did not help.</p>
<p>So I noted down the filenames each of these entries were associated withl- the parts starting:
<code>/File(\EFI\....</code></p>
<p>The Windows one in my case was the file:
<code>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi</code></p>
<p>The &ldquo;grub&rdquo; one was:
<code>\EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi</code></p>
<p>The Linux Mint one was:
<code>\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi</code></p>
<p>Then, shutdown Linux, turn your computer off.</p>
<p>Reboot this time loading Windows (which is probably what will happen anyway given the issue we&rsquo;re trying to solve here).</p>
<p>Open the Windows command prompt in administrator mode (which means to hold Shift and right click it and choose &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo; rather than simply double-clicking it) and type this mystical incantation into it:</p>
<p><code>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi</code></p>
<p>Presumably if you saw something other than \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi when you ran <code>efibootmgr</code> in the previous step then you should put what you saw relating to grub at the end of the <code>bcdedit</code> command rather than copying me exactly.</p>
<p>That said it completed successfully. And since then every time I restarted my computer it&rsquo;s offered me the choice of which operating system to run exactly as it did before Windows greedily overwrote whatever I&rsquo;d done in the first place.</p>
<p>If you decide you did want Windows to just load every time without prompting you could undo the above command by just specifying the Windows bootloader instead of the grub one I think:</p>
<p><code>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\bootmgfw.efi</code> in my case.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>An important point for any debate about treatments for obesity that&rsquo;s often missed or downplayed in certain media takes is that obesity appears to be causally associated with a range of other extremely serious health issues, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27146380/">an early death</a>.</p>
<p>As one example, in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23812">recent review</a>, Pati et al found that 4-8% of all cancers could be attributed to obesity, even if we don&rsquo;t precisely know why that is yet. Having obesity also makes for worse outcomes in general if you do get cancer.</p>
<p>That study ended with a call to collect more data on cancer outcomes regarding the less traditional forms of obesity treatments; surgical interventions and pharmacological. As it happens, earlier this year <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23812">a new study</a> on the former was published. Adams et al find that bariatric surgery patients ended up having a 25% lower risk of developing cancer later on than their peers, along with a 43% lower risk to die from cancer.</p>
<p>A new RCT study that looks at the outcomes of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1">GLP-1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-obesity_medication">anti-obesity</a> drugs that have taken some quarters of the world by storm, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide">Semaglutide</a>, is going to be presented soon. In the mean time, a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/08/2720343/0/en/Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Semaglutide-2-4-mg-reduces-the-risk-of-major-adverse-cardiovascular-events-by-20-in-adults-with-overweight-or-obesity-in-the-SELECT-trial.html">press release</a> has revealed some of the top-level effects. People with overweight or obesity who were treated with Semaglutide had a 20% reduction in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_adverse_cardiovascular_events">major adverse cardiovascular events</a>, including heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular-related deaths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll not know the full details until the full study is published but, assuming the full study is deemed legitimate and in general reflects the headline, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition who is quoted by the <a href="https://conscienhealth.org/2023/08/huge-news-semaglutide-cuts-deaths-cv-events-in-obesity/">ConscienHealth</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semaglutide for obesity is a life-saving medicine for a serious chronic disease. It is now crystal clear that making excuses to deny people the care they need for obesity is unethical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treatments for obesity are not about personal vanity, body shaming or anything along those lines. Sure, they can be misrepresented or misused, but so can a wide range of other less &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; medical treatments. But at the end of they day they are potentially life saving interventions and should be treated as such.</p>

			 <p>Following on having been inappropriately surprised that a person with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a> (DID) might be allergic to orange juice <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/17/when-only-one.html">whilst under control of some personalities</a> but not others, I&rsquo;ve now learned that it&rsquo;s possible for some personalities to be blind when others are not.</p>
<p>Here we have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468893/">a report of a patient known as B.T.</a> She seemed to have been blinded as the result of an accident, and got the appropriate medical tests and later diagnosis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_blindness">cortical blindness</a> as a result of damage to her brain.</p>
<p>She also had DID. Imagine everyone&rsquo;s surprise a few years later, being of the chronological age of 37 years old, when at the times when the personality of a teenage boy was in control <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/24/the-blind-woman-who-switched-personalities-and-could-suddenly-see/">she could see</a> well enough to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that B.T. had just <em>reported</em> not being able to see for years. Brain tests showed that when in other personalities the areas of her brain associated with visual stimuli didn&rsquo;t react to input at all, as one would only expect in anyone unable to see . But when in the personality that was able to see, the sight processing areas of the brain started to light up again.</p>
<p>Over time, with training, most of her other personalities learned to see again, although two remain blinded.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;d totally missed that there&rsquo;s a substantial amount of landing-on-the-moon activity going on at present. Most recently Russia&rsquo;s attempt to be the first to land a craft, &ldquo;Luna-25&rdquo;, on the southern polar region of the moon - despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">everything else</a> that one imagines the administration of that country would be focussing on right now.</p>
<p>That region of the moon is unexplored by landers. It&rsquo;s thought that there might be interesting ice deposits to examine there. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole">the only area</a> of the moon that has craters with interiors that aren&rsquo;t near-constantly in sunlight.</p>
<p>We do know what the moon&rsquo;s south pole looks like from above though thanks to several successful orbital missions. Here&rsquo;s an image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/southpolemoon.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="Image of the moon's south pole, taken by the Clementine spacecraft">
<p>However the Luna-25 landing didn&rsquo;t go well. As of yesterday it has officially &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-luna-25-crash-landing-moon/">ceased to exist</a>&rdquo; as a result of crashing into the moon.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an artist&rsquo;s impression of what it would have looked like if it <em>had</em> touched down in 1 piece, taken from the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-luna-25-crash-landing-moon/">CBS article above</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/luna25art.jpg" width="600" height="460" alt="Artist's impression of Luna-25 on the moon">
<p>Unfortunately, given the impact of the craft crashing into the moon&rsquo;s surface, an artist&rsquo;s impression is all we can expect from that mission.</p>
<p>India is attempting something similar with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3">Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft</a>, due to land on the moon this week. In the US, NASA is funding a commercial attempt to land on the moon from <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/">Intuitive Machines</a> later this year. Another commercial offering, this time from <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/">Astrobotic</a>, is expected this or next year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Lunar_Exploration_Program">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Polar_Exploration_Mission">Japan</a> are also involved in moon-landing missions expected to take place over the next few years.</p>
<p>Most of these are put-robots-on-moon missions. However <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">NASA&rsquo;s Artemis program</a> has a moon landing planned for 2025 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program">Artemis 3</a> - that is looking to drop a couple of human astronauts near the lunar south pole.</p>

			 <p>In the latest reminder that things you upload to the various big social media services aren&rsquo;t yours and can&rsquo;t be relied on to stay there forever, it seems like Twitter has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/08/19/twitter-deletes-all-user-photos-and-links-from-2011-2014/">removed all the photos</a> and some of the links that folk posted on it between 2011-2014.</p>
<p>No-one seems to know if it&rsquo;s deliberate or not,. The email address the press might contact to find out is still responding with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/twitter-elon-musk-poop-emoji">poo emoji</a>.</p>
<p>The forthcoming change to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66550959">prevent you from blocking users</a> is however all-too-deliberate, which is an absolutely wild thing to do imo given some of the content I understand remains on there.</p>
<p>Somehow deleting 4 years of potentially treasured photos still seems on average less bad to me than a previous Twitter shenanigan that resulted in posts that you would justifiably assumed were deleted- because you personally deleted them a long time ago so why would they even still exist anywhere? - <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/deleted-twitter-messages-are-reappearing-for-some-users/">magically re-appeared once more</a>. That one was probably down to incompetence rather than malice. But whatever cause it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine all sorts of potential bad consequences,  embarrassing, awkward or devastating arising, from that.</p>
<p>Whilst Twitter is the current exemplar of these kind of bad practices, seemingly largely because of who runs now runs it, there&rsquo;s little reason to believe that the potential risks are all that much reduced with its competitors either. The sad fact that if you don&rsquo;t own the means of computation then you can&rsquo;t rely on it - admittedly to vastly varying extents - is highlighted here once again.</p>
<p>At the very least, it&rsquo;s a reminder to re-learn the old lessons of backing up everything we care about and being super careful to never share anything there&rsquo;s a chance we might not want to be publicly available in the future. In the real world, both are of course easier said than done.</p>

			 <p>📧 Reading <a href="https://johnmedina.substack.com/">John Medina&rsquo;s Substack</a> newsletter. He&rsquo;s a developmental molecular biologist, and author of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780996032605">Brain Rules</a>. Each newsletter I&rsquo;ve seen so far usually provides a quick summary of something unusual, occasionally jaw-dropping, about the human brain, how it works, what it does.</p>
<p><a href="https://johnmedina.substack.com/p/john-medinas-brain-rules-2b0">Issue 25</a> was one that stood out to me. It told the story of &ldquo;Timmy&rdquo;, one of the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo;  that a patient with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder">Dissociative Identity Disorder</a> (aka DID, previously referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder) had.</p>
<p>Over time his body would appear to be inhabited by one of around 12 different personalities, if that&rsquo;s the right word. Some of his personalities were allergic to orange juice. If he drank whilst one of these was active then his skin swelled up, became red and developed hives. This is not so unusual, people often have allergic reactions.</p>
<p>The twist is that some of his other personalities did not have this allergy. If they were in charge of his inner show at the time of drinking a glass of juice then his body wouldn&rsquo;t show any of those symptoms. No sign of any allergy was to be found.</p>
<p>If he switched from a personality that was allergic to the juice to one that wasn&rsquo;t in the middle of undergoing an allergic reaction then his hives, redness and itching would simply disappear.</p>
<p>It thus became apparent that what&rsquo;s usually assumed to be a physical, deterministic, response to a chemical is in fact context dependent. Whilst no-one thinks we usually consciously &ldquo;create&rdquo; our allergic reactions, this suggests that something somewhere in our brain must unconsciously be governing them. Hence there&rsquo;s a sense in which they are under our control, existing in relation to us rather than simply being an inanimate &ldquo;fact of the universe&rdquo; - even if we don&rsquo;t know to how to consciously leverage them</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in the mind&rdquo; is a phrase that often used derogatorily, unsympathetically and dismissively to patients suffering various conditions, as if suffering situated primarily in the workings of the mind was somehow of lesser concern than suffering entirely on overtly physical phenomena. But stories like this constantly keep me wondering to what extent almost anything of note is at least somewhat &ldquo;in the mind&rdquo;. The book &ldquo;<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/finished-reading-the.html">The Expectation Effect</a>&rdquo; added a ton of counterintuitive examples towards that end.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141014081">The Complete Maus</a> by Art Spiegelman.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/maus.jpg" width="300" alt="Cover of The Complete Maus book">
<p>This is a comic book portraying the author&rsquo;s difficult conversations with his father about the father&rsquo;s experience as a Polish Jew in the Second World War. Harrowingly, but far from uncommonly, the experience included time imprisoned at concentration camps, including the infamous Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Most of the people he knew, most of the characters in the book, ended up dying at the hands of the Nazis. They are shot, hung or, more frequently, the victims of a long, slow, tortuous death journey of absolute neglect from captors who do not see you as human.</p>
<p>Actually the book doesn&rsquo;t portray almost anyone as human, not in literal terms. Whilst the concepts of humanity and inhumanity infuse the story throughout, visually the participants are portrayed as cartoon animals. The Jews are anthropomorphic cartoon mice. Their former gentile country people, occasionally later collaborators, as pigs and the Nazis are cats. And the language is at times rough, ungrammatical, unrefined.</p>
<p>Out of context this might seem to be a strange or trivialising approach to the most awful of events. But in reality the stark black and white illustrative loses none of, and perhaps draws us into, the horror of what transpired. It pulls no punches. The frank representations of what went on maintain their  visceral impact.</p>
<p>As Spiegelman once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe vulgar, semiliterate, unsubtle comic books are an appropriate form for speaking of the unspeakable</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-making-of-maus.html">This exchange</a> sums it up the criticisms along those lines succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that a comic book about Auschwitz is in bad taste?&rdquo; one angry reporter asked him when the book was published in Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Spiegelman replied, &ldquo;I thought Auschwitz was in bad taste.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The father, the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; who survived the horrors, is a complicated character. He&rsquo;s on at least his second marriage and it&rsquo;s not going well. He&rsquo;s miserly, grumpy, demanding, with unpleasant views, whether shaped by his experience of things no human should every experience or otherwise. He&rsquo;s demanding, an incessant. His son, the author finds him hard to be around, wants to avoid him, to get away even as he becomes increasingly unwell. The book switches between the father&rsquo;s story of life in the war back to the present day life and its many tensions until both are resolved, one way or another.</p>
<p>The book - the only graphic novel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_award-winning_graphic_novels">ever win a Pulitzer Prize</a> at the time of writing -  became more famous in recent times following a ban on it by a Tennessee school board, ostensibly <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/the-inside-story-of-the-banning-of-maus-its-dumber-than-you-think/">for its bad language</a> and a tangential depiction of nudity. In it&rsquo;s time the book has also been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/art-spiegelman-russia-maus-bookstores-holocaust">banned in Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/maus-art-spiegelman-book-ban-anti-semitism/672203/">burned in Poland</a>.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the in reality the Tennessee action was nothing more than a continuation of the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/banning-maus-warning-not-only-195228313.html">politically driven book-banning</a> so favoured by the supposed freedom-loving political right of the US. At the very least, I worry about the mind and priorities of anyone who thinks the most disturbing thing about this book is the occasional mild swear words.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the sort of disturbing that is important that humanity never forgets, never thinks can only happen once, only in the past. &lsquo;Never again, and again and again&rsquo; to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/maus-art-spiegelman-book-ban-anti-semitism/672203/">quote the author</a>.</p>

			 <p>📽 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/interstate-60-2002">Interstate 60</a>.</p>
<p>Fun coming-of-age-roadtrip type movie about a young man who is torn between following the life he wants as an artist vs the life his rich father and girlfriend should want, as a lawyer with a fancy red car.</p>
<p>After suffering an injury he ends up in a hospital where he learns that everything is perception, and perception isn&rsquo;t necessarily reality. Somehow this gets him into a parcel-delivery mission down a non-existent highway, accompanied at times by a unusual genital-free man who grants peoples' wishes for better or worse - shades of a much more relaxed and horror-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishmaster_(film)">Wishmaster</a> - via smoking a weird monkey-shaped pipe. Guided by an extremely prescient Magic 8-ball and visions of a lady only he can see, he sets out to delivery his parcel and of course along the way make those all-important life decisions.</p>
<p>Whilst this might imply existential wrangling, it&rsquo;s pretty much light-hearted fun and games in this case. It&rsquo;s written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Gale">Bob Gale</a> who also co-wrote Back to the Future. A couple of the same actors appear - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> who was Back to the Future&rsquo;s Doc Brown, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox">Michael J. Fox</a> who of course was Marty McFly, and it often has similar kinds of vibes.</p>
<p>A lot more enjoyable than I first expected given I&rsquo;d never heard of it before.</p>

			 <p>The clowns are at it again. When Sunak <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/24/another-day-another.html">took over the British premiership</a> from the last Conservative mess of a Prime Minister, someone who must have set some kind of record for their damage-to-tenure ratio, I did have a little hope that he would at least try and be the &ldquo;sensible adult in the room&rdquo; that was promised. No hope at all that he&rsquo;d come up with thoughtful or progressive policies, but maybe at least he&rsquo;d manage to be some kind of boring technocrat before losing the next general election.</p>
<p>I guess I was wrong. It seems like he wants the next election to be fought over the issue of which party can promise to damage the environment the most, with a side-helping of who can make the roads as dangerous as possible for us, their valued citizens. My fear is Labour will actually sign up to that battle, throwing away the last remnants of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html">the only policies of theirs I positively liked</a> to the wind. &ldquo;The wind&rdquo; of course being the next devastating hurricane the ongoing climate catastrophe <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1128221">summons up</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago he was promoting his slightly 2017-robot-disguised-as-human visage via a <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1685582472262602752">photo of him</a> supposedly sitting in Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s old car.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/sunaktw.png" width="600" height="694" alt="">
<p>Inevitably this turned out to be another lie, albeit probably an accidental one, insomuch as the car he was sitting in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gaffe-prone-rishi-sunak-mocked-30591650">was not in fact Thatcher&rsquo;s vehicle</a>, but rather one that her protection squad used.</p>
<p>Sunak of course has form for pretending he&rsquo;s in other people&rsquo;s cars for PR reasons, namely the famous incident him filling up his Kia with post-tax-cut petrol that in fact <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/rishi-sunak-used-sainsburys-employees-car-for-petrol-filling-photo-op_uk_623c7038e4b019fd8138588f">wasn&rsquo;t his Kia</a>.  At least it shows he has wherewithal to feel some tension between showing off his own extremely expensive fleet of cars and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-helicopter-travel-ulez-b2384489.html">unnecessary helicopters</a> and appearing as, same as they all want to pretend to be, yawn, &ldquo;a man of the people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, why was he polluting the media-waves pretending to be in Thatcher&rsquo;s car? Well a part of it was no doubt the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pm-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tory-party-chasing-the-ghost-of-margaret-thatcher/">weird obsession</a> many of the wannabe Conservative movers-and-shakers and their acolytes have with their former Prime Minister who it must be said did actually manage to get things done. The wrong things, sure, but <em>things</em>.  Things with even more impact than the best of today&rsquo;s cabinet sponsored warm-take cringe-tweet.</p>
<p>But also following the only Conservative hold in the recent &ldquo;Day Of 3-Byelections&rdquo;, the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-suffers-by-election-bruising-but-avoids-clean-sweep-of-defeats-12924593">Uxbridge result</a> where they managed to lose only around 93% of their previous majority, it&rsquo;s been decided by all and sundry that the reason they won was because they campaigned against the &ldquo;ULEZ&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite it&rsquo;s name, the ULEZ is not a species of war-mongering aliens, but rather the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">Ultra Low Emission Zone</a>. It&rsquo;s a London based policy whereby if you have a vehicle that emits above <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">a certain threshold</a> of polluting emissions then you have to pay £12.50 a day to drive it within the specified zone.  The zone now includes Uxbridge after the (Labour) Mayor of London extended its scope. So this was admittedly potentially going to get pretty expensive for folk who have cause to regularly drive. Labour seems to agree, with their leader, Kier Starmer, deciding he&rsquo;s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/starmer-urges-khan-to-reflect-on-ulez-rules-after-uxbridge-defeat">against it</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a reasonable criticism that making people with with non-compliant cars pay probably biases the charges towards older cars, which in turn means that the average owner might likely be poorer than someone with a newer, compliant, car (but much richer than someone with no car, plus not all new cars are compliant). Whether the charge will be tilted towards folk with a lesser ability to afford to pay it or not is a factual matter. I&rsquo;m sure someone has looked into it. And if it is, and it&rsquo;s seen as unfair, then sure, let&rsquo;s dream up a new policy that actually gets at what we really want to do here - which is to protect the environment, rather than let people pay to damage the environment.</p>
<p>But somehow the issue of a certain constituency saying they don&rsquo;t like a very specific fairly punitive-at-the-individual-level scheme has developed into the idea that all pro-environmental policies are evil. Hence the Sunak tweet, sitting in his fake car, &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; (cringe) blasting out how he&rsquo;s the true motorist&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just bad tweets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ordered <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66351785">a review</a> of all current low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs). Despite the fact in reality <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular">they&rsquo;re quite popular</a>, even if Conservative MP Nick Fletcher does believe them to be an &ldquo;international socialist concept&rdquo;, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters is that no-one knows what LTN even means. Depending on the definition taken, there may be more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/16/critics-of-uk-low-traffic-schemes-told-that-25000-filters-already-existed">25,000</a> of them. Their main use is to stop a torrent of traffic ripping its way through narrow residential streets. Pedestrians and cyclists can pass freely, and cars can still access the streets in order reach any destination within the area - but they&rsquo;re generally blocked in a way that stops you motoring your way right through a city entirely on the small, easily clogged, heavily pedestrian oriented streets where children play and suchlike.</p>
<p>In a further bid to lionise the act of speeding tons of metal through inappropriate routes, ministers are also apparently thinking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-councils-20mph-speed-limit-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns">restrict councils' freedom</a> to create 20 miles per hour speed limits. The <a href="https://www.roadpeace.org/">RoadPeace charity</a> is amongst many other interested parties who express sentiments along the lines of being &ldquo;extremely disappointed to see roads made demonstrably less safe.”</p>
<p>Central government imposing these restrictions on council decisions - I guess Sunak stopped &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; right after he left the photo-op - might not actually be be legal under current legislation. They might have to change the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/contents">1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act</a> to go ahead with this.</p>
<p>These things are also important for reasons outside of environmental emissions, and in fact aren&rsquo;t necessarily even targeted at improving our atmosphere in that way. As Devi Sridhar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/uk-must-follow-europe-lead-prioritising-walking-cycling-public-transport">recently summarised</a>, this stuff is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;not about banning cars, but about making it cheaper and simpler to replace short-distance single occupancy journeys with alternatives that have far-reaching benefits for the city’s inhabitants and the planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those benefits include staying alive. The ultimate freedom, if we must. It was a campaign group whose name translates to &ldquo;Stop The Child Murder&rdquo; that helped compel the Dutch government to make their cities less car focussed. Over 400 children died in traffic accidents over there in 1971. Now it&rsquo;s more like 17 per year.</p>
<p>Over here in the UK, last year <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/slowing-city-traffic-cuts-road-deaths-by-a-quarter-study-shows/31621">a study</a> found that reducing the speed limit in the city of Edinburgh to 20 mph - the very thing that the government is rumoured to oppose - reduced road deaths by 23%, serious injuries by 33% and collisions by 40%. &ldquo;Livability&rdquo;, things such as safety, health, sustainability and living standards also improved, as did the number of people who supported and were willing to obey the new limits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discerningcyclist.com/which-city-has-the-most-cyclists-statistics/">majority of Dutch people</a> are cyclists now, making them the one of the most physically active populations around according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/dutch-are-most-physically-active-nation-brazilians-are-least#:~:text=A%20new%20global%20Ipsos%20study,of%206.1%20across%2029%20markets.">an Ipsos poll</a> , with all the concomitant health and life-extending benefits that brings. People seem to embrace pro-cycling infrastructure when it exists; increasing the number of cycle lanes in Paris led to a <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/increase-paris-cycle-lanes-leads-dramatic-rise-bike-commuting/">54% increase in cycle usage</a>.</p>
<p>And air pollution does more than cause our planet to burn up. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/doctors-urge-politicians-to-stand-firm-on-schemes-to-tackle-air-pollution">group of doctors wrote</a> to the Labour leader and mayor of London begging them not to bow to the pressure to throw away the progress made so far with initiatives such as ULEZ because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air pollution affects every one of us from before we are born into old age. It not only causes respiratory conditions such as asthma, but also heart attacks, heart arrhythmias, strokes, child developmental disorders, lung cancer and dementia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/air-pollution-linked-rise-antibiotic-resistance-imperils-human-health">recent study</a> also suggests that air pollution may be exacerbating the rise of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance already kills 1.3 million people a year, and if it gets out of hand could in theory make a serious dent in global human population numbers. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.&rdquo; according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">World Health Organisation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ULEZ scheme specifically seems to be helping on the air pollution front. London&rsquo;s air pollution <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-transformational-impact-expanded-ultra-low-emission-zone-so-far">has dropped</a>. I haven&rsquo;t looked into how to quantify this directly in terms of health benefits. But 4,000 of London&rsquo;s deaths were apparently <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/213273/tackling-londons-pollution-will-increase-life/">attributable to air pollution</a> in 2019 so there are some major wins potentially to be had.</p>
<p><a href="http://erg.ic.ac.uk/research/home/resources/ERG_ImperialCollegeLondon_HIA_AQ_LDN_11012021.pdf">One study suggested</a> that if the mayor&rsquo;s air pollution policies were followed then Londoners would gain an extra 6.1 million life years by 2050. It would be even higher, 20% higher, if they managed to meet the World Health Organisation guidelines.</p>
<p>The ULEZ scheme itself aims to <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/pollution-and-air-quality/ultra-low-emission-zone-ulez-london">save over a million hospital admissions</a>, albeit this particular figure sounds like a somewhat vague aspiration that won&rsquo;t be realised until 2050 so possibly one should dig into the evidence around that before parroting it too much.</p>
<p>The doctors raised another important point, and one that highlights that any &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; or economic harm caused to some people by ULEZ is down to policy choices, not its overall objective.</p>
<p>The policy shouldn&rsquo;t stand alone. Rather there should be &ldquo;a commitment to a much more affordable, frequent and reliable public transport system&rdquo; as well. People do need to get to places. No sensible person should argue otherwise. But I can easily think of several other carrot-rather-than-stick approaches that might be added to the mix, rather than removing one of the few things that seems to be working for the sake of the Conservatives desperate attempt to introduce some US-imported-style culture war banter as a last ditch effort to not get totally laughed out of office next time we have a general election.</p>
<p>Obviously the idea should be to put together a package of policies that improve the health of us and our planet whilst mitigating any downsides of any individual approach. Not just give up and throw them all in the landfill-destined bin because a few of those people not rendered too ill by air pollution to get to the polling station in a couple of years time might vote for you.</p>
<p>The insanity is not limited to the motorist love-ins unfortunately. Last week Sunak announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023">a vast expansion</a> of North Sea oil and gas drilling. Living as we do in a post-truth world, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">he claims</a> that this is &ldquo;entirely consistent with our plan to get to net zero&rdquo;. He actually seems to think that it&rsquo;s positively pro-environment. More on this in a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">Oxfam&rsquo;s climate advisor disagrees</a> and highlights that should we want to generate more energy more locally at less environmental cost - all good objectives when the current option often seems to lead to paying war criminals big bucks to import it let alone the environmental concerns - there is an obvious alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low-carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s proposing nationalising the process, or really doing anything other than let whichever company does the extraction run riot on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; market as far as I can see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">Per Mike Childs</a> from Friends of the Earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences will simply pour more fuel on the flames, while doing nothing for energy security as these fossil fuels will be sold on international markets and not reserved for UK use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar comments abound. Kate White from the WWF is <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-heads-to-scotland-for-net-zero-energy-policy-push-12930459">quoted by Sky News</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; [Sunak&rsquo;s plan will] do nothing to cut household energy bills or shore up our energy security - it will simply line the pockets of the extractive industry while the world burns&hellip;the solution to the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis is in affordable, clean energy; better insulation for our homes; and restoring our natural world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carbon Brief <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-why-banning-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-is-not-a-just-stop-oil-plan/">looked into</a> some of the energy security related claims. Unsurprisingly they don&rsquo;t stack up.</p>
<p>Apparently on average it takes 28 years after the granting of oil and gas licenses for the flow of fossil fuels to start. If it&rsquo;s anything like as long as that then these fuels won&rsquo;t come online until the 2040s. They do nothing to solve today&rsquo;s security or cost of living crisis. And by 2040 we should be well on our way towards net zero, with the plan (supposedly supported by Sunak) being to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050. If we need a new flow of fossil fuel at that point then something went very wrong.</p>
<p>There are so many other ways the government could improve the cost of living situation for UK citizens that don&rsquo;t involve waiting a quarter of a century and hoping big businesses show unprecedented compassion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no reason to suspect the fossil fuel companies would by remotely shy about maximising their profits from any new gas and oil that they could possibly get their hands on. In these cost-of-living-whilst-the-world-burns crisis times Shell recently reported its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/shell-makes-record-quarterly-profits-of-nearly-10bn">largest ever first quarter profits</a>: $9.6 billion for the first quarter of this year. BP made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/bp-profits-energy-windfall-tax-oil-gas">$5 billion profit</a> during the same period.</p>
<p>Sunak et al also seem to have gotten this odd idea that &ldquo;buying local&rdquo; is incredibly environmentally beneficial when it comes to fossil fuels, claiming that importing fuel from elsewhere <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12355601/Rishi-Sunak-Just-Stop-Oil-Labour-North-Sea-oil-gas.html">ends up releasing 3-4x</a> as many carbon emissions.</p>
<p>At first this made me wonder if Sunak thinks that we import oil by putting it into small bottles and hand delivering it via single-passenger private jets or something. Once I got over myself, I actually looked into what the reality is and wrote about it in more detail <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2023/08/10/is-british-gas-and-oil-really-4x-as-good-for-the-environment-as-imported-fuel/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The TLDR would be that the &ldquo;3-4x the emissions&rdquo; claim for imported alternatives to North Sea gas and oil is not exactly an outright fiction but it&rsquo;s very misleading. It appears to refer to only the emissions associated with the <em>transport</em> of fuel, only for gas, and only for the minority of gas that is transported to the UK in liquid form.</p>
<p>The process of shipping gas via boat involves converting it to liquid form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas">Liquified Natural Gas</a>, or &ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) before putting it on a boat and then converting it back when it arrives. That is an energy intensive process, quite possibly <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/">generating 3-4x the emissions</a> associated with (just) the <em>transporting</em> of <em>gas</em> via methods not involving LNG, such as via a pipeline.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that only a minority of Britain&rsquo;s imported gas is transported via LNG. <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/">Most of it</a> comes through a pipeline and hence does not incur anything like that process' emissions penalty.</p>
<p>In any case, the emissions generated by even the nasty LNG gas process are <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/sunak-claims-north-sea-gas-four-times-less-polluting-than-imports">only a small fraction</a> of the total emissions generated during the lifecycle of the gas overall. The large majority of emissions come from the actual use of the fuel itself. There is no possible way to reduce the actual emissions associated with that gas by anything like as much as 3-4x by fiddling around with the extraction or transport process when most of the emissions are associated with the end use of the gas itself.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, oil isn&rsquo;t affected by the LNG process so I couldn&rsquo;t find any similar-in-scale emissions savings to be had there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also of note that some countries <a href="https://www.petro-online.com/news/fuel-for-thought/13/sp-global/two-thirds-of-uk-and-norway-north-sea-oil-and-gas-production-has-lower-than-average-greenhouse-gas-intensity-new-analysis-finds/59378#:~:text=The%20analysis%20found%20that%2C%20on,(8%20kgCO2e%2Fboe).">are substantially better than the UK</a> at extracting gas and oil in terms of having reduced emissions for the extraction process itself. The trend there will also be <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Letter-to-Kwasi-Kwarteng-Climate-Compatibility-of-New-Oil-and-Gas-Fields.pdf">that they improve further</a> if they enact the process improvements that they&rsquo;ve already committed to. But this is still not the biggest deal: remember that the majority of the emissions associated with gas come from the usage of the gas itself.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, switching to basically any form of renewable energy would vastly outweigh even the very best case emissions savings one could get from the North Sea network. Vastly. Yes, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html">even when you take into account the end-to-end impact</a> of manufacturing, maintaining and disposing of the equipment needed to use renewables.</p>
<p>Other assumptions that one would have to make in order to see even the small North Sea emissions benefit prospectively on offer include:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the North Sea gas is all kept and used in the UK rather than being exported elsewhere. As mentioned above, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that that will happen.</li>
<li>That any extra gas and oil extracted from the North Sea means that there will be a similar reduction in the amount extracted (and in part exported via LNG) globally. I see no reason to think that that will be true. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve reached a level where the demand for energy is entirely satiated. Instead, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the oil and gas market will simply enlarge. And if more gas and oil is sold then - especially as most of the associated emissions come from the use of the fuels - proportionally more pollution will be generated.</li>
</ol>
<p>So for all Sunak&rsquo;s hobby of &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; he seems to be chatting about only very specific types of freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type of freedom that values the freedom to create traffic jams on unsuitably small residential roads over the freedom to not become ill from other people&rsquo;s air pollution infusing your home. The freedom to legally drive 10 miles per hour faster than you used to be able to, over the freedom to not be involved in a fatal accident. The freedom for a few to greatly profit from the harmful exploitation of natural resources over the freedom for us all to live in a planet with a bearable climate.  You can&rsquo;t enjoy exceeding the 20 mph limit all that much if you are too ill or too dead to drive.</p>
<p>The people who tend to be most <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-hurts-poorest-most">vulnerable to pollution</a> or the immediate <a href="https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/climate-change/how-climate-change-impacts-poverty">ravages of climate change</a> are of course on average poorer, more disadvantaged, and hold less economic and political power than the average person, let alone the CEO of whichever big oil company and the owners of very fast cars. In this way, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html">Frank Wilhoit&rsquo;s evergreen canard</a> that conservatives naturally tend towards the idea that laws exist to protect in-groups by binding out-groups shows its face once again.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://techpod.content.town/">Brad &amp; Will Made A Tech Pod</a>.</p>
<p>The name is pretty self-explanatory. Lots of tech talk, but way less Apple-obsessed as many of the computery podcasts I&rsquo;ve encountered over the years. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve just been looking in the wrong place, but it&rsquo;s nice to see Windows, Linux et al getting a look-in for those of us not fully uploaded to the iCloud.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s all computer-nerding. VR, electric cars and space travel feature in the promo blurb. I learned a lot about how to make decent coffee from a <a href="https://techpod.content.town/episodes/192-straight-out-the-bunn">recent episode</a>. Still need to put it into practice but at least I know how disgusting my current coffee practice is now.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling drawn to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux operating system</a> recently, partly under the guise of <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/article/seizing-the-means-of-computation">seizing the means of computation</a> away from those who would <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/25/the-rule-of.html">surveil us</a>, distract us <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/11/21/microsoft-is-turning-windows-11s-start-menu-into-an-advertisement-delivery-system/">with adverts</a> each time we want to open an app or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-bans-sideloading-ios-apps-mac-m1">restrict us</a> from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/">using our devices</a> as we wish.</p>
<p>Moving as much as possible towards open source software where people who have the coding skills can see exactly what it&rsquo;s doing and contribute changes to anything they don&rsquo;t like seems like A Good Thing overall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been double digit years since I&rsquo;ve looked into Linux. I used it for a while in the past doing networking related stuff but not for more day-to-day tasks. But since then it looks like there&rsquo;s been several options developed that address the challenges that were present back in the day. Namely that it was just all so complicated to set up in comparison to the more &lsquo;consumer-friendly&rsquo; operating systems, doubly so if you wanted to use it in alongside those operating systems.</p>
<p>It was also potentially tricky to find equivalent software to that one may have been used to using on other platforms. However it looks like things have changed a lot in a decade, no surprises there. And, despite only having a limited amount of time to fiddle around with setting things up, it might be well worth trying it out again.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linuxmint.com/screenshots.php">Linux Mint</a> distribution seems to be recommended by quite few folk for people who don&rsquo;t want to spend a whole lot of time learning a new way of computing or figuring out where to get the necessary software for basic day-to-day computing tasks. It appears to come with a tool enabling easy access to tens of thousands of apps.</p>
<p>So I might try that one. But part of the beauty of this scene is that there&rsquo;s many other options available, as well as the ability to modify any particular option that exists, if the one you try first doesn&rsquo;t appeal in the end.</p>

In one example case <a href="https://www.seeker.com/black-swan-shipwreck-ordeal-comes-to-end-1765662614.html">courts ruled</a> that a company that had discovered half a billion dollars worth of treasure had to hand it over to Spain.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/31/a-new-paper.html">A new paper re-affirms that plant-based diets are far less damaging to the environment</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/31/a-new-paper.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-31 12:12:00 &#43;0000">Jul 31, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w">new paper from Scarborough et al.</a> looks again at the level of environmental impact that different types of food pattern consumptions have; everything from vegan through to high meat diets.</p>
<p>How this paper differs from some others I&rsquo;ve seen in the past is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It standardises the dietary intake of each person, hence ensuring that any observed differences aren&rsquo;t a result of meat eaters simply consuming a different number of calories than vegans.</li>
<li>It takes into account the fact that the environmental impact of a certain type of food can vary dramatically depending on how and where it is produced.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nonetheless, the punchline is basically the same as more straightforward analyses show.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed.</p>
<p>Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity.</p>
<p>At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vegan diets were  superior to high meat diets in every measure of environmental impact here. Whilst there is a lot of uncertainty on some measures due to not knowing how exactly each item of food was sourced, in no case at all is that uncertainty enough to make it remotely plausible that vegan diets actually aren&rsquo;t superior on these measures.</p>
<p>Another repeated finding is that there&rsquo;s good returns from simply cutting down one&rsquo;s amount of meat consumption, or switching to fish. In today&rsquo;s world it seems unlikely that everyone is going to seriously consider becoming vegan, but perhaps all of us that haven&rsquo;t yet done so might consider reducing our meat consumption. It will help the planet.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Below are notes I took from reading the paper: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37271576">How much food tracking during a digital weight management program is enough to produce clinically significant weight loss?</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that weight loss can be facilitated by lifestyle interventions.</p>
<p>One of the strongest predictors of how much weight loss will occur is how often participants track the food and drink they consume each day, usually with a view to remaining within a set calorie goal.</p>
<p>However, tracking your consumption in detail is effortful. Most people do not find it possible to do so over the longer term. One approach to improving adherence would be to reduce the amount of effort required, for example by reducing how often people are asked to track food or reducing the amount of their food they are asked to track.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how much food tracking is needed to get to certain weight loss milestones. Studies so far suggest that &ldquo;abbreviated&rdquo; food tracking approaches do correlate with weight loss, with the possible exception of tracking by taking a photo of the food.</p>
<p>Using data from subscribers to a weight loss program over a 6 month intervention period, the study aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>establish whether the abbreviated method of food tracking facilitated by by the program remains associated with weight loss.</li>
<li>establish thresholds of food tracking that are associated with certain weight loss milestones</li>
</ol>
<p>Aim 1 was tested with both a nonparametric and linear regression methods.</p>
<p>There was a significant correlation between the percentage of days participants tracked food with the percentage of their original weight that the participant lost after 6 months, r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.001.  A 1% increase in the number of days tracking food associated with a 0.08% greater in weight loss.</p>
<p>A ROC curve analysis looked at showed that food tracking was highly predictive of the clinically significant 3%, 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds after 6 months. The optimum predictivity threshold was defined by the sum of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<ul>
<li>For predicting achieving at least a 3% weight loss, the optimum threshold of food tracking corresponded to 29% of intervention days.</li>
<li>For 5% weight loss this was 39% of days tracked,.</li>
<li>67% of days was the optimum threshold for predicting the 10% weight loss threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aim 2 added a time series clustering analysis method, dynamic time warping, to look for similarities between member food tracking behaviour.</p>
<p>This produced 3 clusters based on the number of days participants had tracked food in each week over the intervention period. The clusters differed by levels of food tracking, weight loss, participant age and marital status.</p>
<p>This study could not quantify the mechanisms why participants showed different food tracking behaviours. For instance, perhaps some had higher motivation or fewer barriers to food tracking and/or weight loss.</p>
<p>Limitations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants were biased towards being female, with college degrees and higher incomes.</li>
<li>This approach cannot fully establish that food tracking causes weight loss. There could be confounders.</li>
<li>Whilst the optimum thresholds for predicting 3%, 5% or 10% of weight loss were established, there was no step-change in cutoff that perfectly predicted weight loss success. We should be cautious about interpreting the specific thresholds here.</li>
<li>Food tracking was defined as tracking at least 1 food item on a given day; other definitions could be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that participants can achieve clinically significant weight loss after 6 months even without perfect adherence to the recommended daily food tracking. In fact, no-one in this study tracked every day. Given that perfect adherence doesn&rsquo;t seem to be possible for most people, and isn&rsquo;t necessary for achieving significant weight loss, we should question whether it should be the default prescription for weight loss interventions.</p>

<p>That song book-ends the album: the version you know at the start, a substantially differently-vibed demo version at the end.

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781620405710">The Monopolists</a> by Mary Pilon.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/monp.jpg" width="200" alt="Cover of Mary Pilon's book, 'The Monopolists'">
<p>As far as board game creation stories go, the story of Monopoly&rsquo;s invention is a well known one. Not least because for a while it was included in the contents of the game box itself, at least in the US.</p>
<p>For the un-initiated: Stuck at home having lost his job during the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darrow">Charles Darrow</a> had a sudden flash of inspiration and invented Monopoly. Firstly to amuse his family during that difficult time in American history and latterly, in 1935, to sell to the Parker Brothers company. Darrow ends up as an incarnation of the rags-to-riches American Dream story as hundreds of millions of copies of the game were produced and shipped around the world.</p>
<p>The game certainly spread. In the end millions of groups of gamers would go on to learn the basics of capitalist economics, the dog-eat-dog winner-takes all majesty of the free marketplace, with the winner of each game ending up with reams of imaginary real estate and their respective virtual incoming rents from their non-propertied companions. A true simulation of the American Dream, accessible to all, realised like never before.</p>
<p>Except, inevitably, that story isn&rsquo;t true. Monopoly wasn&rsquo;t really invented by Charles Darrow. Or any other individual entirely. Like many other of humanity&rsquo;s cultural artifacts, what we now know as Monopoly is a pastime that evolved over space and time.</p>
<p>The author starts the story with the person that <em>could</em> perhaps most fairly be termed Monopoly&rsquo;s originator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Magie">Elizabeth Magie</a>. Born in 1866, she was very interested in both politics and inventing. This of course was certainly not encouraged for women of that era. Nonetheless, in 1904 she patented &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord's_Game">The Landlord&rsquo;s Game</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/llg.png" width="600" height="942" alt="Patent submission for The Landlord's Game">
<p>Ironically, considering what it turned into, the game was intended to espouse her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgist principles</a> and demonstrate the perils of unbridled rentier capitalism; specifically how monopolies over land led to ruin, and how taxes could be used to ameliorate these outcomes. It was intended as part of a political argument against the massive concentration of land-based wealth in the hands of landlords, not a celebration of it.</p>
<p>In general, the Georgist movement was dead against the private accumulation of wealth from land ownership</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry</a> on Georgism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;although people should own the value they produce themselves, the economic rent derived from land—including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Landlord&rsquo;s Game could be played either with Monopolist rules, where players are incentivised to become monopolists and force other players out of the game - these will be familiar to anyone who has played modern-day Monopoly. But it also came with anti-monopolist rules, where the game is won only when every player has doubled their original money by virtue of communal wealth creation.</p>
<p>Educational as it might have been, it didn&rsquo;t sell very well at the time. But it was taken up by certain communities - notably the Quakers and various socialist-leaning academic types - who passed various incarnations of the rules and materials of the game on to their nearest and dearest, sometimes adding or changing a few of the details. Over time it grew ever closer to the Monopoly we know today. Magie&rsquo;s original version already had the property, railroads, utilities and jail squares familiar to us today, as well as idea of continuously circling a square board with no pre-defined end, a relatively rare setup at that point time. As it passed from hand-to-hand some of the properties got renamed and the Chance and Community Chest cards we&rsquo;re familiar with today were developed.</p>
<p>What came next is a frustrating lesson in intellectual property law. After Darrow sold &ldquo;his&rdquo; game idea to Parker Brother, they went on to persuade Magie to sell them the patent to her original Landlord&rsquo;s Game, misleading her into thinking that they would mass produce and market copies of it, with its original message intact, worldwide.</p>
<p>Well, have you ever seen &ldquo;The Landlord&rsquo;s Game&rdquo; in a game shop? Of course not. In reality, they&rsquo;d wanted to acquire the patent to protect themselves from the increasingly obvious truth that the real story behind the Monopoly game they were selling in such a profitable manner was not one that suited them.</p>
<p>If this book is to be believed - and it certainly seems very thoroughly researched - Darrow and  Parker Brothers behaved somewhat deviously, probably fraudulently, to do their best to retain the sole right - the monopoly -  to sell Monopoly based on its manufactured origin story. Whilst of course compensating none of the many other people who contributed towards the development of the modern-day institution of Monopoly over the decades.</p>
<p>Again layering on the irony, some of the truth of this came out as part of another intellectual property related court case, but one that Parker Brothers initiated. An economist called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Anspach">Ralph Anspach</a> created a game called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Monopoly">Anti-Monopoly</a>&rdquo; in 1973 that was designed to help people understand the perils of real-life monopolies.</p>
<p>Parker Brothers didn&rsquo;t like that the name involved the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; and took him to court to prevent him selling his game. Preparing his defence led Anspach down a path of somewhat obsessive research into the history of Monopoly, with the resulting idea that Monopoly itself should be in the public domain with the copyrights and trademarks Parker Brother claimed to hold being invalid. A decade later a settlement was reached, but not before the case materials revealed a lot of the truth that Mary Pilon now, in turn, reveals to us.</p>

This time this victim is books.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7b774/ai-generated-books-of-nonsense-are-all-over-amazons-bestseller-lists">According to Vice</a>, many of the supposedly most popular entries in the Amazon Kindle Unlimited subscription service&rsquo;s bestseller list recently were in fact fully AI generated nonsense.</p>
<p>A rash of books with similar covers, quite random titles and absolute nonsense inside them apparently hit the top 100 list, at least in categories such as Young Adult romance.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/aibooks.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Some Kindle Unlimited book covers from Vice's article">
<p>My favourite of the ones Vice reported on has to be the catchily named &ldquo;Apricot Bar Code Architecture&rdquo;. The introductory sentence, if you please:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Black lace pajamas, very short skirt, the most important thing, now this lace pajamas are all wet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t imagine too many readers made it all the way through these books meaning that whoever put them there probably isn&rsquo;t raking in too much money per reader. It seems like Kindle Unlimited is paying something like 0.4 US cents per page read, if I understand <a href="https://chrismcmullen.com/2020/06/22/what-is-the-kindle-unlimited-per-page-rate-a-current-month-by-month-breakdown/">Chris McMullen&rsquo;s post</a> correctly. But the fact that they got to the top of the rankings means they&rsquo;re making some amount of money for someone, likely at the expense of the more traditional actually-makes-sense books.</p>
<p>Because Kindle Unlimited pays authors <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201541130">per page read, not per book read</a>, if you can get 1000 people - real or imaginary - to read the first 5 pages of your effortlessly created clickbait book then you&rsquo;ll get <a href="https://justpublishingadvice.com/is-kindle-unlimited-pay-per-page-read-fair-for-authors/">the same amount of financial reward</a> as someone who can get 10 people to read the entirety of their award-winning 500 page novel - and more than if 5 people who read your 500 page novel valued it so much that throughout their later life they each read it another 10 times each.</p>
<p>I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t take much for the same folk who set up fake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm">ad-clicking farms</a> to switch to fake book-reading farms.</p>

			 <p>New(ish) Conservative party faction just dropped. Let&rsquo;s welcome the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Conservatives_(UK)">New Conservatives</a>&rdquo; to the party.</p>
<p>They join the <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/who-are-the-british-national-conservatives/">National Conservatives</a> and a bunch of other factions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Group">European Research Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID_Recovery_Group">Covid Recovery Group</a>, <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955771/who-are-tory-net-zero-scrutiny-group">Net Zero Scrutiny Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_Group">Common Sense Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Collar_Conservatism">Blue Collar Conservatism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Research_Group">Northern Research Group</a> and no doubt many others that don&rsquo;t quite come to the top of my mind right now. One day there will be more factions than politicians if we lucky.</p>
<p>The New Conservatives faction has the extremely non-unique selling point of not liking immigrants. They did manage to come up with a 10 point policy, but every point is a unsubtle rewording of &ldquo;immigration needs stopped&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although if they do ever fully exhaust our patience with anti-immigration cruelty they <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-rishi-sunak-tory-new-conservatives-mp-cut-immigration/">do have aspirations</a> to move onto being - can you guess? Let&rsquo;s all say it together: anti-woke.</p>
<p>🥱</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let the i headline speak for itself:  <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/theyre-dickheads-new-conservatives-group-of-mps-will-cost-us-the-election-sunak-allies-say-2456774">‘They’re dickheads’: New Conservatives group of MPs will cost us the election, Sunak allies say</a></p>
<p>In particular they appear to be very concerned that the current Prime Minister - who constantly explicitly tells us that lowering immigration, at a time where in some ways the country might actually need immigrants more than ever even for purely selfish reasons, is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-five-key-priorities-for-2023">one of his top priorities</a> at basically any cost - even the cost of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-court-rule-if-plan-relocate-asylum-seekers-rwanda-is-lawful-2023-06-28/">breaking international law</a> -  should think about adding lowering immigration as one of his priorities. How efficient they are to have achieved their goals before they even existed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fun interview on the July 3rd episode of <a href="https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/episodes/7Drgf42/">The News Agents podcast</a> where the one of the high-ups of this pointless new faction really really tries to wriggle out of agreeing that what he wants to is prevent is even the most cruelly oppressed and tortured women stuck in Afghanistan from seeking asylum in the UK amongst other things, when that actually seems to be the whole point of his tediously unoriginal faction. Add dishonesty to the litany of sins.</p>

<p>But Sunak et al are still sticking to their story that wanting to see Mickey Mouse is a the main  driver of the treacherous journey some of the most desperate children in the world make to our shores.</p>

			 <p>The latest deranged volley in the Conservative Government&rsquo;s extremely inhumane and extremely ineffective &ldquo;anti-immigration&rdquo; policy has arrived.</p>
<p>It turns out that some asylum reception centres have cartoon images on display.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/mm.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="A room in an asylum reception centre with cartoon characters on the wall">

<p>This is, of course, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/04/18/woke-dover-welcome-signs-channel-migrants-to-be-replaced/">Too Woke</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/minister-home-office-staff-paint-over-art-asylum-centre-2451897">The Independent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Immigration Minister said pictures of cartoons and animals must be removed and that staff should make sure they are painted over, as they give an impression of welcoming, which Mr Jenrick didn’t want to show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The staff, being humans, <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/home-office-staff-refusing-ministers-order-to-paint-over-art-for-children-at-asylum-centre-2457066">didn&rsquo;t want to do this</a>.

<p>Presumably the concern is that millions of children are going to willingly risk their lives at great personal cost to themselves and any remaining family that they may or may not have in order to enter a country that is actively hostile to their very existence mainly because they want to see a picture of Mickey Mouse.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Frank Wilhoit <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">succinctly encapsulates</a> how at least a subset of conservatives - I suppose he would say all conservatives - appear to think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:</p>
<p>There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may feel contrary to the classic, now feeling extremely old-fashioned, idea that conservative politics tends towards the politics of law and order.</p>
<p>That sentiment was never straightforward to interpret. There is more to law and order than proudly caging the largest number of people you could possibly justify in an entirely inadequate prison system. But in Wilhoit&rsquo;s telling it presumably can&rsquo;t really ever be the case. At least not whilst the law purports to be something that applies equally to all people.</p>
<p>At any moment in time the conservative parties and surrounding movement might look to be extremely pro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)">law and order</a>. But this just means that the law is such that it currently promotes their own interests, usually at the expense of some other group&rsquo;s interest.  Should this stop being the case, so will the avid conservative fandom around the legal process.</p>
<p>These examples are probably so obvious as to not really be worth expressing, but we can see how quickly certain branches of the UK and US conservative movements reacted with wanton disrespect for the legal process and norms as soon as their political heroes - Boris Johnson and Donald Trump - were called to account for their illegal and immoral behaviour.</p>
<p>Johnson was more than happy to explicitly <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-brexit-international-law-eu-withdrawal-agreement-b431691.html">break international law</a> to get his own personally-preferred type of Brexit. In the mean time, some of the conservative British media attempted to brand judges who were insufficiently enthusiastic about that same event as being &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling">enemies of the people</a>&rdquo;. Trump&rsquo;s supporters, well, some of them famously engaged in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">a violent insurrection</a>.</p>
<p>In Wilhoit&rsquo;s mind then, what would anti-conservatism thinking look like? Simply put, the idea that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a sidenote, <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/">we&rsquo;re not talking about</a> Francis Wilhoit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_M._Wilhoit">the political scientist</a>, but rather Frank Wilhoit the classical music composer who just happens to share the same name.</p>

			 <p>Learned that you can work in two branches of the same local git repo at once without problems via the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">git worktree command</a>.</p>
<p>Useful for if you want to quickly fix some code without having to faff around committing or stashing the stuff you were working on</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</code> automatically creates a new branch whose name is the final component of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>, which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For instance, <code>git worktree add ../hotfix</code> creates new branch hotfix and checks it out at path <code>../hotfix</code>. To instead work on an existing branch in a new worktree, use <code>git worktree add &lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s increasingly apparent that relying on the ability to reliably access or even link to internet content outside of the truly open web is a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
<p>I had problems today building even this little blog, receiving a lot of &ldquo;Failed to get JSON resource&rdquo; errors. The culprit turned out to be my use of a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcode</a>, which my blog software kindly provides in order to make it easy to embed tweets in their full interactive glory.</p>
<p>To date it&rsquo;s always been possible for someone who is not logged in to see an individual tweet and for tweets to be embedded on sites. There are sites that almost entirely consist of embedded tweets and some commentary on them, for better or worse (usually worse).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally guessing, but I&rsquo;m going to assume that the sudden failure of this method of embedding tweets was a side effect of  Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; change to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/twitter-makes-tweets-super-secret-and-inconvenient-if-you-log-out/">prevent not-logged in users</a> from seeing anything on Twitter. As well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html">stopping logged in users</a>, even the rare ones that actually pay for the privilege, from seeing as much as they might want to on Twitter.</p>
<p>This and the ongoing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2023/06/21/reddit-strike-one-week-on-a-third-of-subreddits-still-down/">Reddit API fiasco</a> makes me wonder whether Ryan Broderick was right in a <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/paying-to-use-a-site-you-cant-use">recent edition</a> of his newsletter to imply that the only future-proof option for the average user to share even very mainstream content these days is to post screenshots. Doubly so for any content on any site popular enough in in theory be bought by some ideologically incompatible billionaire. How web 1.0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While trying to track down the actual hyperlink to a post I found a screenshot of on a closed social network I was struck by how on an internet full of closed platforms, broken embeds, and crumbling indexes, the last reliable way to share anything is a screenshot. In other words, the camera roll is, at this point, the real content management system of the social web.</p>

			 <p>For anyone who is sick of either whatever the latest &ldquo;rich person ruins social network&rdquo; drama is or the thought of what their own younger self thought was just fine to post to the entire world, the software &ldquo;<a href="https://redact.dev/">Redact</a>&rdquo; looks like a free and versatile way to remove your posts from a huge variety of services.</p>
<p>It contains filters to allow you to selectively delete things. For example, perhaps you want to delete only Reddit posts you made last year that included the phrase &ldquo;I love Reddit&rdquo;, or only the last 7 days of your Twitter DMs. You can also <a href="https://redact.dev/support/ui/desktop/scheduler">set up a schedule</a> if you want to repeat the delete every so often.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/reactdev.png" width="600" height="326" alt="">
<p>Looking at some of the commentary around the tool it seems like it occasionally stops working for some services. Presumably this is due to changes the social network companies make, including those targeted at stopping tools like this. I suppose you might be infringing certain terms of services if you mass-delete like this in many cases. But whilst the networks don&rsquo;t spend much effort building their own tools to make it easy to manage and delete your past submissions to their services for obvious reasons this certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel like a <em>moral</em> crime.</p>
<p>In order to delete things you are going to have to log into your account of the respective services through this software, so you will have to feel OK about trusting that the software isn&rsquo;t doing bad things. <a href="https://redact.dev/faq">They claim</a> that Redact doesn&rsquo;t store your info or transmit it anywhere, that their staff have no way of seeing your username of password. But it is closed-source so you can&rsquo;t check the code directly, so caveat emptor I suppose. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone suggesting that anything malicious is going on.</p>
<p>The full list of services it can remove stuff from is long:</p>

			 <p>In &ldquo;<a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-wanted-to-be-a-teacher-but-they">I wanted to be a teacher but they made me a cop</a>&rdquo; Adam Mastroianni makes the case that teaching someone is not the same as evaluating someone. The two are often in fact at odds with each other.</p>
<p>He suggests separating the two. Some people become professional teachers, others become professional evaluators. They are after all very different jobs even if we usually try to wedge the latter into the former right now, despite the (over)importance of grades et al. in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing evaluation on its own would have a few major benefits. First, it would force us to take evaluation seriously.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Second, we’d see how hard evaluation is, and maybe we’d do it better.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>And finally, if we made evaluation its own thing, we’d see how nasty it is, and maybe we’d do less of it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m totally guessing, but I&rsquo;m going to assume that the sudden failure of this method of embedding tweets was a side effect of  Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; change to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/twitter-makes-tweets-super-secret-and-inconvenient-if-you-log-out/">prevent not-logged in users</a> from seeing anything on Twitter. As well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html">stopping logged in users</a>, even the rare ones that actually pay for the privilege, from seeing as much as they might want to on Twitter.</p>
<p>This and the ongoing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2023/06/21/reddit-strike-one-week-on-a-third-of-subreddits-still-down/">Reddit API fiasco</a> makes me wonder whether Ryan Broderick was right in a <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/paying-to-use-a-site-you-cant-use">recent edition</a> of his newsletter to imply that the only future-proof option for the average user to share even very mainstream content these days is to post screenshots. Doubly so for any content that’s hosted on any site popular enough in in theory be bought by some ideologically incompatible billionaire. So web 1.0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While trying to track down the actual hyperlink to a post I found a screenshot of on a closed social network I was struck by how on an internet full of closed platforms, broken embeds, and crumbling indexes, the last reliable way to share anything is a screenshot. In other words, the camera roll is, at this point, the real content management system of the social web.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781444741223">11.22.63</a> by Stephen King.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/sk112263.jpg" width="200"  alt="Book cover for 11.22.63 by Stephen King">
<p>Jake Epping, a down-on-his-luck teacher, is recruited by a friend to kill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> before he gets a chance to kill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">President J. F. Kennedy.</a></p>
<p>Why? His friend, Al, believes that if JFK had survived then the world would now be a much better place, not least because his practice of politics may have meant that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> would never have happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get rid of one wretched waif, buddy, and you could save millions of lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how, given the book is set in relatively modern times, 2011? Well, as luck would have it, Al has discovered a strange portal in a corner of a diner. Walking through it leaves you in the same geographic location in the year 1958.</p>
<p>You can return back to modernity as and when you want. And no matter how long you spent in the past-times world, it&rsquo;s only 2 minutes later when you come back to 2011. But it might be a totally different 2011 if you did something in the past that had substantial repercussions.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy">Kennedy was shot in 1963</a>. So Jake has a few years to get accustomed to discretely living in the past, to learn how the world used to work. Unfortunately for him, the past has a way of resisting changes to the original timeline. You might plan to do something that was never done in the 1960s only to be inexplicably diverted, distracted or incapacitated en-route. This tendency is not infallible, the past can change in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not entirely straightforward.</p>
<p>A further complication is of course the mystery surrounding the JFK assassination. In our world there are plenty of people out there who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories">do not believe</a> Oswald was the real assassin, or at least not the sole person involved. These people include the large majority of Americans in a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1813/most-americans-believe-oswald-conspired-others-kill-jfk.aspx">2001 poll</a>.</p>
<p>Would killing Oswald in cold blood <em>really</em> stop JFK being assassinated? Especially if not only is there a decent chance that he wasn&rsquo;t the sole operator involved, but also that tendency of the the past to exert mysterious forces in the direction of recreating its original timeline.</p>
<p>Jake is not a natural murderer. Understandably he wants some certainty that there is some point to conducting this operation before committing such an alien act.</p>
<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not the only unknown. Sure, Al believes JFK staying alive long would have dramatically improved the world. But would it really? Would there be no cost to pay at all? Few people would feel certain about that, and Jake is no stranger to doubt. So many time travel stories have conveyed to us the idea that altering the past could have intended consequences for the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, living in any community for several years means you&rsquo;ll struggle not to build up a lifestyle, habits and human relationships that might be hard to put aside for a small chance of possibly doing something that may or may not make the future a bit better. That&rsquo;s even if you could navigate your way through an alien world that resists your every attempt to change it so as to be in the right place at the right time to put a potentially huge dent into standard-timeline history.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m pleased to say that a mere 800ish pages later you&rsquo;ll find out what Jake thought and did.  Yes, it is a mammoth tome, so long that had it not come with such a strong recommendation I doubt I&rsquo;d have considered starting it. But the recommendation was a good one. It was over long before I could ever have gotten bored of it.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781804547779">Red Team Blues</a> by Cory Doctorow.</p>
<p>In this novel, Martin Hench is an almost-retired forensic accountant who has expert skills in tracking down criminals committing financial-style crimes. We&rsquo;re talking about the mega-rich and their penchant for moving money around in order to conceal  their unnecessary wealth or fund things that should not be funded; money laundering, tax evasion, all that unfortunate stuff.</p>
<p>But before calling it a day he agrees to do one last job for a friend who made a rather questionable decision when designing a new cryptocurrency with very problematic implications. Whilst the rewards on offer are substantial, this final job of course turns out to be a bit more complicated than Hench expected.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/rtb.jpg" width="200" alt="Red Team Blues book cover">
<p>The title of the book comes from the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red team</a> vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)">blue team</a> used in several fields including cybersecurity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A red team is a group that pretends to be an enemy, attempts a physical or digital intrusion against an organization at the direction of that organization, then reports back so that the organization can improve their defenses.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>There may also be a blue team, a term for cybersecurity employees who are responsible for defending an organization&rsquo;s networks and computers against attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the red team are the attackers. That&rsquo;s the position Hench usually found himself in during his career, albeit  he wasn&rsquo;t just pretending to be the enemy.</p>
<p>The blue team are the defenders, in his life this would be the role of the criminals he tracks down as they seek to hide their identities and wealth.</p>
<p>Throughout the book we learn the power imbalance in these roles: the blue team must constantly defend against every possible threat, whereas the red team just needs to be successful one time to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it hard not to love a book with this amount of computer nerdery in it. I mean, you don&rsquo;t read sentences  like &ldquo;Danny was old Silicon Valley, a guy who started his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a> host so he could help distribute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt.*_hierarchy">alt hierarchy</a>&rdquo; in all that  many action thrillers. Some of the technology behind cryptocurrency also features. But don&rsquo;t let that put you off if you have different tastes. It&rsquo;s not an academic treatise. You don&rsquo;t need to have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">the blockchain</a> in order to appreciate the action.</p>
<p>I even enjoyed the acknowledgements: &ldquo;thanks to every crypto grifter for giving me such fertile soil to plow&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/19-thoughts-on-affirmative-action">Yglesias' post </a>in response to the recent SCOTUS <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-affirmative-action-programs-harvard-unc-rcna66770">ruling against affirmative action</a> will generate plenty of heated debate. But I was struck by one of the points that&rsquo;s not really about affirmative action at all, or at least not along the dimensions of identity we mostly commonly think about with this topic.</p>
<p>Part of the benefits of being allowed into an elite US university is that they&rsquo;re tremendously well resourced. Harvard&rsquo;s endowment fund was worth <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/10/15/endowment-returns-soar-2021/">an astonishing $53 billion</a> recently. It could provide a huge amount of the best quality educational resources to it&rsquo;s ~21k students.</p>
<p>But should it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the smarter you are at age 18, the more educational resources you should receive” is not an obviously correct allocation of social resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be an empirical matter as to what educational distribution model is best for a given society. But first we&rsquo;d have to define what &ldquo;best&rdquo; even means.  I&rsquo;m sure there are  many highly conflicting opinions out there on that.</p>
<p>Perhaps today&rsquo;s division of educational resources is the ideal arrangement for some outcome. But it&rsquo;s certainly not some kind of natural law that the lion&rsquo;s share of these resources must go towards the people who already did particularly well on a test when they were a child.</p>
<p>Especially insomuch as the sort of people who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-022-00120-3">do well on school tests</a> and, even moreso, <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2017/01/low-income-students-harvard">gain access to elite institutions</a> today tend to be those who <em>already</em> had access to the most resources since the day that they were born.</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago I went to the <a href="https://feverup.com/m/96397">Van Gogh Immersive Experience</a> in London.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the gentleman in question.</p>
<p><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/uploads/2023/4755ffee9f.jpg"

       alt="A 3D projection of one of Van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s self portraits" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m in general artistically ignorant, I was already a fan particularly of his extremely famous &ldquo;Starry Night&rdquo;. The exhibition was kind of short and a bit gimmicky in places, but I do feel like I came away with a deeper appreciation and knowledge of the fellow and a deeper awareness of his art so I&rsquo;m overall happy enough to have gone.</p>
<p>One such new-to-me fact was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#">Van Gogh</a> was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/was-vincent-van-gogh-color-blind-it-sure-looks-like-it-27576085/">thought to be colourblind</a>. This may be what is behind his iconic use of colour. Perhaps he literally saw the world differently to most of us do.</p>
<p>Born in 1853, Van Gogh was an even more tortured soul than I had realised. Famously he had psychotic episodes, worsening over his life. These occurred alongside bouts of depression, epilepsy and possibly bipolar disorder. Without the necessary support it could make him hard to live with at times; the well-known cutting his own ear off incident apparently occurred shortly after a huge row with a housemate.</p>
<p><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/uploads/2023/3ab0a912b7.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"
   data-gallery="61d7f16118c07e4696877c80df0fdd7e"

       style="border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="Copies of several of Van Gogh self-portraits" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>He was fully aware of his condition and the concomitant delusions, checking himself into a psychiatric hospital after the ear event. Even inside such a place he was artistically productive when not entirely incapacitated, producing some of his very widely known pieces of art. Sometimes these were based only on what he could see out of his room&rsquo;s window, other times by the contents of his dreams: &ldquo;I dream of painting and then I paint my dream&rdquo;. Over his lifetime he produced over 2000 artworks.</p>
<p>Eventually he was deemed fit and safe to go return to the outside world. Unfortunately it was too soon. On the last day of his life, July 27th 1890, aged 37, he painted one final picture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_Roots">Tree Roots</a>, and then, a couple of hours later, shot himself in the chest. It wasn&rsquo;t an instantaneous death, but two days later he was no longer with us.</p>
<p>Sadly, Van Gogh wasn&rsquo;t at all well-known or renowned during his life. The excitement around (and incredible valuations of - some have since sold for the equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_paintings">hundreds of millions of dollars</a>) his paintings came much later.</p>
<p>The main titular &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; part of the exhibition occurs at the end of the show where you get to sit in a deck chair in a big dark room surrounded by animations based on his most famous paintings and quotes, with an appropriate soundtrack for as long as you feel like witnessing the loop.</p>

</p>
<p>Pragmatically, it must be said that given the surfeit of excellent and free museums and galleries in London this one is pretty expensive for what it is. That said, I guess the immersive part of it probably isn&rsquo;t available anywhere else so if you want to see that there&rsquo;s little choice.</p>
<p>My pro tip if you have some-but-not-infinite cash to burn would be to buy the standard ticket (£18 per adult), not the VIP one (£27.90), even if you want to have a go at the extra VR experience. You can buy entrance to the VR part when you&rsquo;re there if you want, currently for £5. VIPs can queue-skip, but then again I went on a random Sunday and there was no queue at all. You also don&rsquo;t get a poster to go home with, but there&rsquo;s plenty to be had in the gift shop.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since I had a wonderful day out in London with a well-connected friend, enjoying activities that might soon be illegal in parts of the US.</p>
<p>We braved <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/15/the-uk-is.html">the heat</a>, fueled only by frozen variations of cocktails, to take advantage of the many free festivals that were on offer that weekend.</p>
<p>First up we saw the self-proclaimed &ldquo;first Black Drag King from Birmingham to have been featured on Channel 4&rdquo;: the incredible <a href="https://linktr.ee/Don1birmingham">Don One</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>This was on the riverside pedestrian area somewhere outside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southbank_Centre">South Bank Centre</a> if I recall correctly, so there was no roof to raise but without question it would have been had there been one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@donone5868">Youtube channel</a> for anyone interested in experiencing the Don1 vibe.</p>

<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t catch the name of this duo, but they were a couple of hilarious drag queens with maximum lip syncing and audience interaction. They took a small break in the middle so they could have a quick on-stage prosecco brunch, entirely understandable given the sunshine.</p>

</p>
<p>Then a few streets away from, and unrelated to, the drag stage, I got to witness  <a href="https://theyesmess.com/">The Yes Mess</a>, whom you can also take a look at on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheYesmess">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Why my &ldquo;illegal in the US&rdquo; comment above? Well, it relates to the drag performances that formed part of the above adventures.</p>
<p>As part of the Republican effort to invalidate any minority that doesn&rsquo;t look and behave exactly like Donald Trump, some of their politicians and lawmakers are attempting to introduce bans on drag shows.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t hyperbole. I&rsquo;d foolishly assumed that &ldquo;drag ban&rdquo; was a catchy name in general for the ever more horrific legislation around gender and sexuality certain US states are producing rather than something literally relating to drag shows. And although it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a part of the same effort, there are restrictions or bans specifically for drag shows being proposed.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/anti-drag-show-laws-bans-republican-states?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">the Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the proposed bills include defining a drag performer as someone performing while using dress, makeup and mannerisms associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/drag-show-bans-tennessee-lgbtq-rights">absolutely ridiculously restriction</a> on the supposedly sacred freedom of expression value the same folk likely claim to hold dear. The thought that some of the folk enriching our lives by providing hilarious and harmless weekend entertainment could be prosecuted for doing so is truly mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Not that this style of performance would necessarily be what the impact would be limited to. As is typical, laws designed to cause anguish to a section of society that the proposers don&rsquo;t credit as having any moral worth to worry about whatsoever tend to spill over to other areas. Famously, the definition above would presumably ban the several of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing_in_literature#Early_modern_literature">storylines involving cross-dressing</a>. This is especially ironic given that back in the day all of their female characters would have been played by men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not convinced that watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire">Mrs Doubtfire</a> - presumably first in line to lose its PG rating - when I was a kid did me permanent harm. Although having not watched it in a while I also don&rsquo;t know if it aged well.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/19/us-residents-can.html">US residents can join class actions against Google and Facebook&#39;s abuse of their data</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/19/us-residents-can.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-19 17:29:54 &#43;0000">Jun 19, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>Anyone in the US who did a Google search between 2006-2013 might like to <a href="https://www.refererheadersettlement.com/">sign up here</a> before the end of July 2023 in order to join a class action lawsuit against them.</p>
<p>Google has committed to pay out $23 million dollars in total, although given rather a lot of people did use Google over that 7 year period it&rsquo;s thought to be likely to come out at about $7 per claimant. So honestly it&rsquo;s this is just a very minor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/for-companies-like-facebook-5-billion-fine-just-another-expense-2020-12">cost of doing business</a> for Google unfortunately.</p>
<p>Why the payout? Surprise surprise, it&rsquo;s ad-driven big tech misusing your personal data once again.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/technology/google-class-action-settlement-claim.html">NYT&rsquo;s report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consolidated class-action lawsuit filed in 2013 accused the company of &ldquo;storing and intentionally, systematically and repeatedly divulging&rdquo; users' search queries and histories to third-party websites and companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is seen as a violation of privacy laws as well as defying what Google itself claimed to be doing to its users. It&rsquo;s a particular issue because people often search for something quite personal to themselves. We&rsquo;ve largely been trained to feel unconstrained in our searching - Google is the first port of call for many who suspect they are suffering from a medical issue for instance - despite the fact that in reality these days you might often assume that anything you type into the internet will one day be divulged to someone you didn&rsquo;t expect to see it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google search queries often contained sensitive and &ldquo;personally identifiable&rdquo; information, including &ldquo;users' real names, street addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account numbers and more, all of which increases the risk of identity theft</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook is also in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/business/facebook-settlement-apply.html">similar trouble</a> for its unconstrained sharing of your personal data to various external groups, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">infamous Cambridge Analytica</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s parent company, Meta, agreed last year to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of sharing user data or making it accessible to third parties, including the data and political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, without users’ permission</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you used Facebook between May 2007 and December 2022 in the US then <a href="https://facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim">sign up here</a> before August 25th 2023 to apply for your share of a $725 million payout.</p>
<p>I think both these actions require you to have been a US resident during the relevant period, although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve looked into what exactly the technical definition of that is.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062876812">Divergent Mind</a> by Jenara Nerenberg.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/9780062876812.jpg" width="200" alt="Book cover of Divergent Mind">
<p>This book encourages us to consider a type of diversity less commonly considered in mainstream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">diversity, equity and inclusion</a> efforts: the differences in how people think and feel, with a focus on how they process sensory input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Temperament rights&rdquo; captures the idea that we should respect individual&rsquo;s temperament and neurology in the same way that we should respect other aspects of people such as their gender, sexuality, or ethnic identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the focus is on people with high sensitivity. This is commonly an aspect of diagnoses like autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, synesthesia or those termed  &ldquo;highly sensitive people&rdquo;, as well as present in plenty of people who have no medical diagnosis at all.</p>
<p>Living in a world not attuned for ones' sensory processing can be overwhelming, exhausting and frustrating. Things that seem perfectly normal to other people - loud music, crowds - can be very stressful. &ldquo;Everyday&rdquo; tasks we&rsquo;re all supposed to be able to do such as housework or adhering to deadlines might be difficult. At the same time they might truly excel in other areas of life.</p>
<p>The difficulties are compounded by the pressure those with these conditions feel to fit in, to appear &ldquo;normal&rdquo; throughout life. They do this by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_(personality)">masking</a> their experience. They may feel compelled to do this in every aspect of life, including in social and workplace environments, silently facing an extra challenge many of us do not. Women are apparently particularly prone to this, with their behaviour in general being more policed within our patriarchal society, having been socialised to mask more often and more effectively.</p>
<p>Of course this comes at a cost. Sufferers may appear to lash out or exhibit other behaviours determined by many to be &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. They commonly present with comorbidities such as depression anxiety, shame, guilt, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and distorted self-image. Masking by definition precludes you from living a life in accordance with your true self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that the person concerned themselves doesn&rsquo;t realise what&rsquo;s causing their challenge. They might seek treatment just for the more visible symptoms of their condition rather than what underlies it, or another condition entirely, which is generally ineffective.</p>
<p>One criticism I&rsquo;ve seen of the book is that it heavily focuses on a particular demographic of folk with neurodivergences - most obviously women, and in particular middle class women. There&rsquo;s not a ton of discussion about the effects of poverty, race, sexuality or other intersections of identity. I can see aspects in this in terms of the suggestions of how to live a life more compatible with one&rsquo;s sensitivities that are provided at times. Moving to a quieter neighborhood, redecorating your house, reading the latest research on neurodivergence or getting a new job more suited to your cognitive style are not exactly opportunities easily open to all.</p>
<p>Of course if you fit into this sort of demographic or know people who do, this might be a benefit rather than drawback when it comes to getting insight into yourself or others, And to be fair, many of the suggestions are more widely applicable.</p>
<p>The critical message of the importance of learning to accept yourself as you are and then working to accept others as they are is clearly a message that can benefit us all. If this book helps people that struggle through life for one reason or another understand they&rsquo;re not alone and certainly not broken or deficient then it&rsquo;ll obviously be a force for good.</p>
<p>On the gender front, a man with such a condition might be a little surprised at its female focus given the title doesn&rsquo;t make that so clear. But I guess it acts as a counterbalance against the dominance of maleness in past psychological and medical research, a topic the book goes into some detail about when it reviews the history of psychology as a discipline. Given some of these conditions may present differently in women than men one might need to read another book on top of this one for a full understanding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a inevitable tension here between the idea of celebrating neurodiversity versus the pathologisation of it. Under the former mindset, no-one&rsquo;s thinking or sensory style is right or wrong. There&rsquo;s tremendous amount of variation such that the concept of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is itself largely flawed. Whether a mental tendency makes your life harder or easier is often really a product of societal and environmental choices rather than something inherent to the condition - consider the &ldquo;social model&rdquo; of disability.   Even what we regard as a disorder certainly has changed and will again change dramatically over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DSM is more like a catalogue of current social ailments than scientific hardwired “diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand people do often end up as being labelled as having a  disorder. Some who suffer may seek this out. This risks marking them as &ldquo;aberrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;weird&rdquo; or &ldquo;sick&rdquo;. Expectations may be lowered, judgements may be received. But such a label unfortunately is often necessary to gain access to healthcare or support systems.</p>
<p>Although there can be upsides in carefully-used labels. Many people feel far better once they&rsquo;ve found a label that seems to describe how they exist in the world, that what they experience is both &ldquo;real&rdquo; and acknowledged. It helps them understand why some parts of life feel particularly challenging whilst they may be highly proficient in others. It also makes it easier to find a support community of people like oneself.  The book contains many stories of women who couldn&rsquo;t understand why life seemed to be so much harder for them than others for years until finally, later in life they received a diagnosis. They often felt validated, and gained access to a language that allowed them to discuss their needs with others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly hard to argue with some of the overall takeaways. Sentiments like the quote below are universally useful to bear in mind, even if it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d say is especially particular to the issue of neurodivergence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s really nothing right or wrong about people; we’re all just people doing our best&hellip;It’s important that we see differences, that we don’t deny them; but let it stop there and respond to everyone with kindness and help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it might well be that the often invisible, misunderstood and hard-to-classify neurodivergences are an aspect of humanity that we&rsquo;re particularly bad at considering in this context. We should certainly do our best to fix that. Educating ourselves and others such that such variations in experience exist is surely an important first step in building a world that more people feel comfortable existing within.</p>

			 <p>The UK is once again <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65895069">experiencing a heatwave</a>, a situation likely to become <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2018/2018-uk-summer-heatwave">ever more common</a> whilst we fail to solve climate change.

<p>It turns out it depends on where in the UK you live. One declares a heatwave when a location experiences daily maximum temperatures of at least a certain threshold for at least 3 consecutive days. But what the threshold is varies based on which county you are in, as the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/temperature/heatwave">Met Office shows</a> in the below map.</p>

<p>Each youngster represents a real-world herd of elephants that the <a href="https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/">Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a> has helped survive in a world where other groups of humans are working against the ability of elephants to thrive.</p>

			 <p>TIL: Last year scientists <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abb3634">discovered a bacteria</a> of such relatively huge size that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adc9387">easily visible</a> to the naked human eye.</p>
<p>First found in the swamps of Guadeloupe, <a href="">Thiomargarita magnifica</a> is around 1cm in length, which is over 5000 times larger than the average microbe. It&rsquo;s apparently <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/june/worlds-largest-bacteria-are-visible-naked-eye.html">above the theoretical limit</a> of how large we thought bacteria should be able to grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When compared to most bacteria, it would be like a human encountering another human as tall as Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/23/scientists-discover-world-largest-bacterium-thiomargarita-magnifica-bacteria">the Guardian</a>, which describes them as the size of human eyelashes.</p>

			 <p>Leutner et al. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-023-02447-w">provide evidence</a> of a link between having obesity and later developing a diagnosed mental health condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Receiving a diagnosis of obesity significantly increased the odds for a large spectrum of psychiatric disorders across all age groups, including depression, psychosis-spectrum, anxiety, eating and personality disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s evidence elsewhere towards the direction of causation between obesity and mental illness potentially running both ways, in this case the diagnosis of obesity usually came first.</p>
<p>There are many theories as to why this connection might exist presented, ranging from biological explanations such as inflammation or gut bacteria, through to more psychosocial factors, including the impact of obesity on one&rsquo;s quality of life.</p>
<p>It also affects different demographics differently, with the risk of being later diagnosed with a mental health condition being higher in younger people and females (even beyond the usual differential in mental health diagnosis rates).</p>
<p>In any case we might add enhanced mental health support as a requirement for supporting people living with obesity.</p>

			 <p>On another AI note, Google is going to <a href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2023/05/23/yes-google-s-ai-infused-search-engine-will-have-ads">introduce adverts</a> to its generative AI search/chat feature. Whilst inevitable, perhaps it won&rsquo;t be long until we&rsquo;re looking back fondly at that brief moment of time where we could amuse ourselves chatting to the AI-gods without being asked to buy a mattress. Let the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">enshittification</a> begin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/google-ai-generated-ad-tools-will-put-brands-search-chat/2496381">Ad Age</a>:</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re also offering tools to allow people to make ads via the same kind of technology. This doesn&rsquo;t seem entirely without risk given the present limitations of these models.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-integrates-generative-ai-into-ad-campaigns-395835">Search Engine Land</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advertisers can submit creative content such as images, videos, and text related to a campaign, and the AI will “remix” these materials to generate ads that target specific audiences and meet objectives like sales targets, according to the presentation.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns that the tool could disseminate misinformation, as AI-generated text can confidently assert falsehoods. One individual familiar with the presentation commented that the AI is optimized for converting new customers and does not have an understanding of truth.</p>

			 <p>Noticed a couple of newish <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> features. Firstly there&rsquo;s an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/openai-chatgpt/id6448311069">official iOS app</a>, available for free. An Android one is in the works.</p>
<p>Also you can now share your AI conversations via sending a link. Anyone who knows the link can open it so be careful what you include - although by default it&rsquo;s at least somewhat anonymous. Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t particularly trust the system with any sensitive info in the first place.</p>
<p>Once the recipient opens it they can read the convo and keep on chatting to the robot mastermind in a copy of the same session. It&rsquo;s a snapshot though, if you continue the conversation after generating the link, the recipient doesn&rsquo;t see the new bits.

<p>I guess the real question is for those folk who have chatGPT perform a sizeable amount of their job for them. Will they communicate with their colleagues exclusively via chatGPT links, or does that give the game away too much?</p>

<p>I came to it for an antidote to the recent AI mega-hype, to which it did provide some counter-balancing relief with episodes featuring experts such as Emily M. Bender  of &ldquo;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Stochastic Parrot</a>&rdquo; fame . But the weekly show covers subjects far beyond AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-tech-podcasts-reply-all-alternatives">Mashable</a> sums it up well as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a healthy counter dose to the nauseating tech utopia idealism that typically surrounds Silicon Valley and its enthusiast press coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a decent dose of philosophy in between discussions of the technology itself. The most recent episode had an interesting history of consumerism throughout the ages, leading up to the current algorithmically-spewed mess that is the results you get when you search for most categories of products via Google or Amazon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumerism is an anti-solidary machine&rdquo; was one of my favourite soundbites from that one, which also hints at the show&rsquo;s somewhat socialist leanings.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/brooklyn-nine-nine/seasons/8">season 8 of Brooklyn 99</a>.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, the final season of the surprisingly funny police comedy dropped right into a period where humanity had once again been forced to confront the horrors of police brutality after witnessing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd">the murder of George Floyd</a> amongst other horrific incidents. Of course a pandemic had also been raging for a couple of years.</p>
<p>So it had a lot to deal with in order to seem anything other than entirely silly and tasteless.  Given the context, the writers did feel the need to <a href="https://tvline.com/2020/06/23/brooklyn-nine-nine-spoilers-season-8-episodes-police-violence-protests/">throw away the scripts</a> they&rsquo;d already written for the first few episodes and start again. But with their new efforts I think they did reasonably well all things considered.</p>
<p>The pandemic references did seem to fade out after the first few episodes. But in between the various slapstick comedy japes there were obvious attempts to acknowledge and address some of the issues around bad policing and the reactions to it, cringe and otherwise. It might not be enough for anyone who just can&rsquo;t see anything about policing as funny or entertaining any more, but it could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>And so many fairly funny in-jokes. I wouldn&rsquo;t start with this season if you&rsquo;ve never seen it before. But then again what wild kind of person would ever start a show on anything other than series 1?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/05/cannabis-is-now.html">Cannabis is now legal for recreational use in 22 US states</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/05/cannabis-is-now.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-05 09:01:05 &#43;0000">Jun 5, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of months ago <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1?r=US&amp;IR=T#delaware-6">Delaware became the 22nd US state</a> to legalise recreational use of cannabis. It&rsquo;ll be taxed at 15% with half the revenue going to a Justice Reinvestment Fund, which is there to  &ldquo;improve quality of life for communities most impacted by the prohibition of marijuana and &lsquo;war on drugs&rsquo; era policies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Medical usage is now legal in 38 US states in addition to Washington DC.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a map showing where and where not, courtesy of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/8ade337328.png" width="577" height="424" alt="" />
<p>In Washington state, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/wa-senate-passes-bill-to-bar-hiring-discrimination-for-cannabis-use/">legislation is going through the system</a> that helps ensure its new status is respected in a practical as well as legal sense. It will be illegal to discriminate amongst job applicants based on their use of cannabis, so no mandatory pre-interview drug test and the like.</p>
<p>This makes sense because 1) cannabis is legal and the average employer has no business caring about what you do in your spare time when it doesn&rsquo;t affect your work performance, and 2) current tests for cannabis look for the presence of it in bodily fluids rather than whether you&rsquo;re &ldquo;intoxicated&rdquo; from it right now. You can test positive days or potentially weeks after you actually ingested the cannabis. So if the concern is around something like turning up to work high then the tests won&rsquo;t help in any case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll remain some exemptions to the anti-discrimination law for certain jobs in industries like airlines or those requiring security clearance. And employers can still test you after you&rsquo;re hired.</p>
<p>These exemptions are controversial in some quarters, with a representative from The Cannabis Alliance drawing the parallel that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the same approach were applied to alcohol, employers would refuse employment to anyone who enjoyed a beer or glass of wine on the weekend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, over here in the UK, there&rsquo;s been no substantive move in legislation for years for the general use-case. At least not in a sensible direction. Cannabis remains a wholly illegal class B drug, in the same category as for instance amphetamines, whereby mere possession could in theory result in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing">prison sentence of 5 years and an unlimited fine</a>. It was actually reclassified from a lesser-penalised class C drug to a class B drug in 2009, which has been its status for the vast majority of time since the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents">1971 Misuse of Drugs Act</a> came into force.</p>
<p>There was one positive and humane move in 2018 when cannabis and some of its derivates <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a22561279/medicinal-cannabis-products-legal-uk-2018/">were legalised for UK medical use</a>. At least in theory, but seemingly it&rsquo;s under such restrictive controls that it&rsquo;s hardly available in practice.</p>
<p>The NHS details <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/medical-cannabis/">the medical conditions it&rsquo;d be considered</a> for as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very few people in England are likely to get a prescription for medical cannabis. Currently, it is only likely to be prescribed for the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>children and adults with rare, severe forms of epilepsy</li>
<li>adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy</li>
<li>people with muscle stiffness and spasms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would only be considered when other treatments were not suitable or had not helped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even when these conditions are met, patients report that the NHS rarely delivers the goods. From <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-54749353">the BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NHS has repeatedly refused to fund medical cannabis for children with severe epilepsy, families have said.</p>
<p>Three prescriptions are thought to have been written for &ldquo;whole plant cannabis&rdquo; oil since it was legalised two years ago, campaign group End Our Pain say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leaves families of patients for which these medicines truly do seem to help needing to raise vast sums of money and/or access the uncontrolled black market at the risk of their own liberty in order to get hold of what they need to live a reasonable quality of life.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> looks to be a super useful utility for anyone who works a lot with cloud storage providers. It connects to a huge number of cloud services - Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox, Amazon S3 and many many others, as well as more classic file transfer methods such as FTP. And then you can manage all your cloud files without caring what or where they are.</p>
<p>For example you can easily back up your files to a cloud service, copy files between cloud services or even mount a cloud service as a normal disk drive and use it similarly to how you use your local disk. Imagine never having to use various cumbersome web interfaces and/or install each service&rsquo;s drive syncing software again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, open source and works on Windows, Linux and Mac so almost everyone with a computer can give it a whirl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily a command line tool based on various Unix commands, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off. There is an experimental browser interface you could try. But really the power of it makes it probably worth figuring out if you regularly have the sort of tasks to do that it might help with.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard">Star Trek: Picard</a> season <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard/seasons/2">2</a> and <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard/seasons/3">3</a>.</p>
<p>Dwelling here only on season 3: if you grew up in the era of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> and enjoyed it (or at least the re-runs), then it&rsquo;s very likely you will like this one too.</p>
<p>In fact if you only saw certain clips of it then you might think you were actually watching the older series, at least if one overlooks the special effects being less rickety and the entire Enterprise crew having aged a few decades. Space apparently doesn&rsquo;t keep you any younger than standard 21st century living. Not even if you&rsquo;re a robot or an all-powerful never-dying galactic alien or whatever, which is a little strange but I suppose hard to work around.</p>
<p>To be fair, they do try and provide in-episode explanations of this and the other curious happenstances in the fantastical world which probably have more to do with the logistics of getting an old and much-loved human cast from 30 years ago together than a screenwriter&rsquo;s vision. It&rsquo;s occasionally a bit contrived, occasionally a bit cheesy, but I appreciate that one does what one must to allow the original crew to save the galaxy one more time.</p>
<p>There are some systematic differences vs TNG, including more swearing and greater character flaws compared to the almost always extremely family-friendly original. Plus the series is designed to follow a single story line rather than the old-school one-story-per-episode method.</p>
<p>But all in all, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a parting gift, and an excellent one, to fans of 1980s-1990s trekking. Although I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if it&rsquo;ll be quite as intelligible or entertaining if you don&rsquo;t know, for example, why Worf&rsquo;s new meditation habit is intrinsically hilarious even in concept.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the post-trailers scene on the last episode!</p>

			 <p>A lawyer is facing potential sanctions for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">using chatGPT to create inaccurate legal documents</a> in support of a court case.</p>
<p>In response to an airline claiming that they have no liability to Roberto Mata, who sued an airline on the basis that he was injured by a serving cart, his lawyers submitted a 10-page brief summarising several relevant court decisions.</p>
<p>But the opposing side, and for that matter the judge, couldn&rsquo;t find the details of the cited decisions. Because they didn&rsquo;t exist. The cases were fictional. The lawyer had gotten them from <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, probably quite innocently. To be fair, he&rsquo;d even specifically asked the system to confirm that they were real cases, which it confidently did. But this was one more example of these large language models to &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo;, to produce <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a> that sounds legitimate, is formally referenced and so on, but simply isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>Lawyer Steven Schwartz claims to have not known about this aspect of ChatGPT, which seems like something society is really going to have to address big-time once this technology is <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html">fully integrated within standard office software</a>, assuming these issues persist.</p>
<p>Lawyers are not the only courtroom officials leveraging this new technology even now. There&rsquo;s a couple of reports of judges using it to aid their decision making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/colombia-judge-chatgpt-ruling">ChatGPT user from Colombia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A judge in Colombia has caused a stir by admitting he used the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT when deciding whether an autistic child’s insurance should cover all of the costs of his medical treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His decision wasn&rsquo;t entirely based on ChatGPT output, and the verdict doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been all that contentious, but the fact that the tool was used to support it has raised some concern.</p>
<p>Judge Padilla thinks the tech can make the legal system more efficient, in which case it&rsquo;s in line with a 2022 law that requires public lawyers to use technologies that facilitate this. The whole &ldquo;use AI to make important things cheaper&rdquo; is one of the moves that particularly worries me. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like efficiency - which let&rsquo;s face it almost certainly means or proxies for cost - should be the top priority for court decisions.</p>
<p>Secondly <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2023/03/29/indian-judge-uses-chatgpt-for-views-on-bail-plea-of-murder-accused/">one from India</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Indian judge used ChatGPT to make a decision on the bail plea of a man accused of murder&hellip;A bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara at the Punjab and Haryana Court in northern Chandigarh city on Monday sought the AI tool&rsquo;s help while hearing the bail application of Jaswinder Singh, accused of rioting, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy and murder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These of course are just a couple of cases that happen to have made it to the news for one reason or another. No doubt chatbots are being used by many more professionals in many more courtrooms. It&rsquo;s probably inevitably going to become more widespread over time, short of legislation prohibiting it which seems unlikely (and potentially not desirable at least at some future point).</p>
<p>They are after all a potentially useful tool for many professions. And no-one really quibbles with, for example, allowing lawyers to search the web no matter how much misinformation that contains. But people tend to have an appreciation of the limits of a web search; I doubt many lawyers just paste the first result from a Google unchecked into their court submissions.</p>
<p>The new chatbots that deliver what appears to be a single statement of undisputed truth in a confident manner are likely more dangerous to use in these cases without a thorough understanding of how they work and their limitations, which potentially only a low proportion of users may have.</p>
<p>Of course in a perfect world, we&rsquo;d like to imagine that professionals take care to understand the tools they choose to use. But at some point, particularly with extremely complicated systems subject to extremely high amounts of hype that appear to make one&rsquo;s life easier at no cost, it&rsquo;s probably an unrealistic expectation.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1646945378">This Is Why</a> by Paramore.</p>
<p>A pretty different sound to some of their past albums, including the one that I most recall from my more formative years - <a href="https://album.link/i/604804755">Riot!</a> But, hey, it&rsquo;s 2023, and we&rsquo;ve all changed a lot.</p>
<p>For one, the band members are no longer teenagers, but rather in the dreaded mid-30s. And producing work that feels fairly spot on in terms of describing the terror and angst of a certain very common kind of modern-day adult life.</p>
<p>We start off with a track that could have provided the background music to vast number of social media posts discussing the latest stupid thing, at least in spirit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t leave the house</p>
<p>You say the coast is clear</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t catch me out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they turn to the topic of the news, never a safe watch these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every second, our collective heart breaks</p>
<p>All together, every single head shakes</p>
<p>Shut your eyes, but it won&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>Turn on, turn off the news</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, as instantiation of the guilt we feel when once again we&rsquo;re running late, once again we forgot to do whatever we promised, once again we failed to do the Right Thing, once again we concocted an excuse that we know isn&rsquo;t exactly true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intentions only get you so far</p>
<p>What if I&rsquo;m just a selfish prick?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whatever happened to the supposed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ok-state-wire-migration-immigration-coronavirus-pandemic-business-361a9bf86ea3175194957b7550bb6051">Roaring Twenties, version 2</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a single year, I&rsquo;ve aged one hundred</p>
<p>My social life: a chiropractic appointment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But honestly, rather than me typing out their entire track list it&rsquo;d be more fun to go listen to the album.</p>

<p>When consumers are given the explicit choice as to whether to allow companies to track your activity across the web, not very many people are OK with it.

<p>Facebook is of course one of the more famous exploiters of this kind of technique.

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/chernobyl">Chernobyl</a>.</p>
<p>The catastrophic disaster that followed after the Chernobyl nuclear power station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">melted down and exploded</a> in 1986 is something that I feel like I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;always&rdquo; known of but with with very little grasp of the what and why behind the event. Even more than 3 decades later it seems to remain within the public consciousness to some extent, occasionally deterring people from embracing the idea of nuclear power plants, frustrating those who feel like nuclear is an essential part of the climate change solution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these days the site appears to have become a common enough stop for  &ldquo;<a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a27882635/chernobyl-influencers-tourism/">disaster tourists</a>&rdquo;, with social media influencers  <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/chernobyl-hbo-tourism-instagram-influencers">chasing the clicks</a>. There&rsquo;s a Chernobyl tourist information centre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/28/chernobyl-art-party-nuclear-pripyat-ukraine-artefact-valery-korshunov">that sells</a>  &ldquo;T-shirts, hot-dogs, fridge magnets, gas masks and, if you so choose, a full nuclear fallout suit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In any case, this TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/awards/">won many awards</a>, and basically universal acclaim from everyone I personally know who watched it. I don&rsquo;t think it was initially available to watch the UK but if you have a <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/">Now TV</a> subscription it&rsquo;s been there a while. And I certainly found it worth watching, now feeling like I have a much better grasp on the circumstances that surrounded the catastrophe and the context within which it occurred. This is no bland documentary though, the drama is as gripping and compulsive as in any other show I&rsquo;ve seen in recent times. There are some upsetting scenes, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>Of course a risk in these dramatization of real events is that they do not in fact reflect the real event in question all that much. Witness the allegations against <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/05/watched-season-of.html">The Crown</a> for instance. But this one I understand was at least largely <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chernobyl-disaster-how-accurate-is-the-hbo-series/">driven by fact</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of liberties and editorial decisions were of course taken; representing a whole segment of people with an individual, making court case testimony a lot more dramatic and dynamic than it actually was, that kind of thing. The nature of the event is also such that the full and unvarnished truth may in any case never be fully known by anyone outside of those who were involved.</p>
<p>But something I really appreciated and I wish every such &ldquo;dramatisation of a real event&rdquo; show would do was the release of an official <a href="https://pca.st/70TV">accompanying podcast</a> that explained where  each episode diverged from reality and why those decisions were made.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_01_15/">Cat Pictures Please</a> and <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_05_23/">Better Living Through Algorithms</a> by Naomi Kritzer.</p>
<p>These are a couple of surprisingly wholesome sci-fi short stories. The former has won plenty of awards, including a Hugo award for best short story in 2016.</p>
<p>In the former, the AI behind a search engine becomes sentient - but doesn&rsquo;t feel compelled to destroy humanity.</p>
<p>In the latter, a new social media app launches - but doesn&rsquo;t turn into a destructive hellsite on day one.</p>
<p>So some might say they&rsquo;re perhaps a little far-fetched. But it&rsquo;s a refreshing change from the relentless dystopia associated with near-future technology either in fiction or reality. And who knows, maybe it&rsquo;ll help inspire a bit of IRL thinking about how technology could in fact work for the betterment of our lives.</p>
<p>Reading them also reminded me that short-story magazines exist. Both have been published in  &ldquo;<a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/">Clarkesworld</a>&rdquo;, a monthly sci fi and fantasy magazine I&rsquo;m now tempted to subscribe to.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/21/from-the-guardian.html">The rise of private GP practices in the UK</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Following years of Conservative government mismanagement and un-resourcing of the rightly-venerated <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">National Health Service</a>, the UK is seeing a dramatic rise in the number and usage rates of private GP practices.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/19/patients-paying-550-an-hour-to-see-private-gps-amid-nhs-frustrations">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patients are paying up to £550 an hour to see private GPs amid frustration at the delays many face getting an appointment with an NHS family doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst the NHS has always had unfortunate exceptions, flaws and inequities in provision it now feels more fragmented than ever before to me. Probably the most critical issue it that it appears to have become essentially unbearable to work in much of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Resignation rates skyrocket as the workplace conditions become increasingly horrendous, incompatible with living a reasonable life.  From those who remain, we lose <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-crisis-why-are-so-many-staff-leaving-the-health-service-12812473">hundreds of thousands of working days per month</a> to mental health related NHS staff absences. Pay dwindles in comparison to comparable opportunities.  Recruitment rates are far too low to make up for any of this, even if one could safely trade an experienced professional for a fresh graduate, the pipeline of which now in any case risks being held back due to the lack of experienced staff available to supervise on-the-job-training. And then the reliance until now upon foreign-born healthcare workers has come back to bite the country whilst on one hand we bemoan the lack of staff in healthcare and beyond and on the other hand create a deliberately hostile environment for anyone who could possibly be construed as &ldquo;not British&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-crisis-why-are-so-many-staff-leaving-the-health-service-12812473">end result</a> is over 130,000 open NHS vacancies.</p>
<p>Amongst other issues, this leads to frequent challenges for members of the public in accessing the skeleton-staffed services that remain. This has now got to the state where fully <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/17/one-in-eight-britons-pay-for-private-health-services-survey-shows">1 in 8 Britons have paid for private health services</a> in the last year. 27% of Britons considered doing so but ended up not doing so, in many cases because it&rsquo;s expensive. Few people can realistically afford the more than £500 per GP appointment figure that we started off with above.</p>
<p>So all in all, 40% of the population has at least had the thought that they may have to turn to private healthcare in a country previously famed for its visionary universal healthcare system. The vision - admittedly <a href="https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-not-always-free-point-use/">never fully realised</a> - was a service &ldquo;free at the point of delivery&rdquo;, such that we&rsquo;d never have to individually ponder to what extent we should trade off our health against our wealth.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Something of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">return to blogging</a> seems to be in the air, at least in some circles. Whether inspired by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/08/elon-musk-broke-twitter/">semi-destruction of Twitter</a>, an increased awareness of the bad incentives and surveillance capitalism that are <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">infused within the places</a> where the world previously moved the bulk of its personal posting to in the past - the big social networks - or part of a vaguely-defined <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/19/how-can-you-spot-a-vibe-shift-that-transforms-popular-culture-ask-me-i-literally-invented-the-term">vibe shift</a>, it feels positive to me.</p>
<p>But how to start a blog can be a bit less immediately obvious and accessible than signing up to Facebook is. First up, there&rsquo;s only one Facebook, one Instagram and so on - which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/29/facebook-privacy-monopoly/">part of the problem</a> - whereas you can host the same blog in many different places. That even includes on your own computer in your own house, although that&rsquo;s not to be recommended for most people! After all, a traditional blog is really just a website that displays pages in a certain format, so most places where you can write on the web you can blog. However for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t need to be too &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, particularly if they&rsquo;re not super familiar with web hosting or coding and prefer to focus on their post content, it&rsquo;s probably easiest to start off with a third-party host that is specifically designed to host blogs.</p>
<p>Below is list of the ones I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;ll also add some thoughts as to what went through my mind when it came to choosing one myself. That said, one shouldn&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you do not want to spend your time reviewing the options, just pick one and start writing. Honestly if you were to just pick one at random you&rsquo;d probably end up somewhere that you have far more control over and access to more useful features than the mainstream social networks.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated who are in no mood to spend time exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> might be a reasonable default for traditional-style blogs because:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s extremely widely used by individuals and big organisations for all sorts of sites. This means it&rsquo;s generally reliable, plus widespread enough that if it doesn&rsquo;t suit you then it&rsquo;s a format that some other blog hosts can import from which can make switching to another site later easier.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a (permanently) free option if you don&rsquo;t mind them adding advertising to your posts. This might be especially good if you just want to see whether the blogging is something you are going to enjoy before spending time or money setting up something fancier,</li>
<li>Wordpress probably can be cajoled to do almost anything in theory, although it might be complicated and/or expensive to fully customise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For something more akin to the social media posting experience - short posts with no titles, single photos etc. then if you&rsquo;re open to paying then <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> is one I use that&rsquo;s more aimed at this style of usage - although it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to write traditional long posts too; see for example the one you&rsquo;re currently reading! It does cost a subscription, but there&rsquo;s a free trial if you want to try it out (and a summer sale on at the time of writing). <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> offers another easy-to-use take on microblogging that has a ton in common with the bigger social media sites, for better or worse, including free options. But it comes at the cost of having less control over your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>However if you have any interest in looking around then I&rsquo;d certainly recommend doing so to see if which of the options feel most in line with the ethos of what you want.</p>
<p>As noted, you can build a blog with almost anything web-orientated. A text editor and some web hosting works. But to keep the list manageable, I&rsquo;ve only included those that are ready-to-use cloud services with functions tailored to blogging. As far as I know you can just sign up to use any of them and write a basic blog post that the whole internet-enabled-world can see with minimal effort or technical skill required.</p>
<p>This means I&rsquo;ve excluded some big categories like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generators</a> you&rsquo;d run on your own computer or anything involving setting up self-hosting. These have a good following but are a perhaps more effort than I&rsquo;d guess the average person new to blogging wants to deal with. But they certainly have advantages if you&rsquo;re minded to survey all options.</p>
<p>Now the list. I&rsquo;ll include the tagline for each one in case that helps understand who they&rsquo;re targeting. To be clear, I&rsquo;m just pasting their tagline in, not my opinion.</p>
<p>First, the three I currently personally use for various things. Obviously this means I like them enough.</p>
<ul>

<p>The next few I understand to be more general &ldquo;make it easy to build any kind of website easily&rdquo; offerings. To be fair, Wordpress is really that these days. But they do have dedicated templates or features for bloggers so I&rsquo;ve included them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>: &ldquo;Everything to sell anything.&rdquo;</li>

</ul>
<p>Other categories you might consider include sites targeting newsletter creation, <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> being the obvious one. Although it&rsquo;s very much email newsletter focused,  people read your newsletters on the web, within a Substack app or, to some extent, via  RSS readers, which makes it bloggy. But it&rsquo;s set up to prioritise the newsletter side of things so unless that&rsquo;s your focus it might be of less interest.</p>
<h2 id="things-you-might-consider">Things you might consider</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a non-exhaustive list of things that went through my mind when thinking about blogging platform choice. Honestly there&rsquo;s a lot here that you don&rsquo;t really need to care about at all in order to just start blogging, particularly if it&rsquo;s a personal blog.</p>
<p>Plus if you do overlook something you later want to change, well, part of the joy of blogging is that you&rsquo;re almost never locked into anything. Change it later! Some people appear to enjoy changing their blog hosting every few months.</p>
<p>So certainly don&rsquo;t let not being up for reading incredible amounts of rambling about tiny decisions put you off getting started right away. It&rsquo;s important to remember that for a lot of people the alternative we&rsquo;re comparing blogging to is posting on social media where you have essentially no control over anything.</p>
<p>But in case like me you enjoy dramatically overthinking everything:</p>
<p>How do you want write your posts?</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely all blog hosts have some kind of web editor you can use. But how exactly you write your posts might differ.
<ul>
<li>Some use &ldquo;block editors&rdquo; where you construct your posts out of a series of blocks for various types of content. For example maybe your post has a paragraph of text block, then an image block, and then another paragraph of text block that you can move around as you wish.</li>
<li>Others are more like typical word processors. You just write your document and embed what you want within it in the same way as Google docs works.</li>
<li>Is it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> interface? If not, is there some way to preview what the post looks like pre-publishing?</li>
<li>How do you format text, define headings, add other media etc? Maybe you use menu items or keyboard shortcuts, again like Google Docs' default. Would you prefer to write in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a>? Can you edit the HTML directly? Sidenote: markdown is fairly easy to learn and after I did so I found I it invaluable to use in all sorts of places unrelated to blogging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you prefer to write on the go, is the web editor easy to use on a phone? Does the provider have its own app you can write in?</li>
<li>If you already have favourite writing apps, can they publish directly to your blog? For example, <a href="https://ia.net/">iaWriter</a> can<a href="https://ia.net/writer/support/ipados/publish-to-blogging-platforms"> publish directly</a> to several blog hosts. <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> has addins that can do things like <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">publish to micro.blog</a>. This is more likely if it&rsquo;s one of the big hosts or they use some API or protocol that&rsquo;s common. Although there&rsquo;s no need to over-complicate things, copy and paste usually works fine.</li>
<li>Can you edit and update your posts? Almost certainly the answer here will be yes.</li>
<li>Do you want to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future, or to edit the post dates for other reasons?</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you want your blog to look and work? How much technical ability do you want to expend to make it so?</p>
<ul>
<li>How much do you want to be able to customise your blog? It may be very little if your focus entirely on your writing or other content. After all most people are happy enough posting on social media where you basically have zero control over what it looks like. But it might also be a whole lot if you have a particular design in mind, especially one that&rsquo;s something other than the norm.</li>
<li>Do you like the default format of the blog enough? That way you can just begin posting right away.</li>
<li>Are there different pre-made themes you can easily apply to your blog? Do you like any of them?</li>
<li>What elements of the design can you customise beyond any preset themes?</li>
<li>How do you make these customisations? e.g. is it a case of point-and-click, filling in forms, selecting from dropdowns etc. or do you need to know some kind of code?</li>
<li>If you do know or want to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> code, are you able to add that kind of custom code to your blog? It&rsquo;s likely the only way to get full control over its appearance, but it&rsquo;s also something that many people may have no interest in doing.</li>
<li>If you want some interactivity beyond basic link-clicking, is that possible? Are there pre-made widgets or plugins that you can drop in? Is there ability to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> code or equivalent to add interactive features?</li>
</ul>
<p>What type of content does the host support?</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, blog posts have a title. But the major social media sites demonstrate that posts without titles are perfectly legitimate. Does the host work well with both posts that have and do not have titles, if you think you&rsquo;ll use both types?</li>
<li>Can you make pages other than blog articles? For instance many people like to have a static &ldquo;About me&rdquo; type page that is outside the chronological flow of the regular blog posts.</li>
<li>Can you directly upload pictures, videos, PDFs and any other types of file you might want to share. Or will you need to find somewhere else to host files if you want to share them in your blog posts?</li>
<li>Are there limits on file sizes, types, etc?</li>
<li>Are there any restrictions on what types of things you can embed from other sites? For instance, if you plan to share Youtube videos, you&rsquo;d want to know that they&rsquo;ll display nicely.</li>
<li>Does it integrate with any other online services you&rsquo;d like to connect to it?</li>
<li>Can you add custom code if you want to - HTML, CSS, Javascript, whatever?</li>
</ul>
<p>On site navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a built-in site search feature?</li>
<li>By default blogs are usually arranged in reverse chronological order. But are there further ways to organise or navigate through your posts? e.g. categories, tags, folders.</li>
<li>Can you create menus, lists, tag clouds, or whatever else you think might help people to navigate your site?</li>
</ul>
<p>On a different topic, how does the hosting company make money? Are you comfortable with whatever the answer is?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some charge you a certain amount of money to host your blog, usually a monthly or annual subscription. These are often the most transparent but are of course not accessible to anyone who can&rsquo;t or doesn&rsquo;t want to afford the cost.</li>
<li>Others are free or have a free offering. Of course they&rsquo;re not free for the company to actually run, so how do they make enough money to sustain themselves? For example it might be by:
<ul>
<li>displaying their own adverts on your site. If this is the case, are you comfortable with the adverts? Both content-wise and to whatever extent they track your readers.</li>
<li>by collecting data, possibly covertly, from your readers.</li>
<li>by relying on some users to upgrade to a paid offering.</li>
<li>VC or other funding (but then what will happen when that runs out?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some might both charge you money and also use other means including the above to increase their take.</li>
<li>If they don&rsquo;t appear to have any way of making money&hellip;why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few more points around longevity, if it&rsquo;s important to you that your blog will last. Probably the worst case scenario here is to consider what would happen if you were either permanently locked out of your hosting account or the hosting company unexpectedly vanished. But there are several other less dramatic but much more likely to happen issues around being locked into a given provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you easily back up your site? Can it be automated? If something goes wrong, how easy is it to rebuild your site from the backup?</li>
<li>Can you export your posts if you decide you want to move hosts? How easy would it be to import them elsewhere? This includes your writing, but also any photos, videos, etc.</li>
<li>Do you fully own your posts? Has the host any rights over them?</li>
<li>Can you use a custom URL? i.e. a web address of myblog.com rather than e.g. a subdomain myblog.thehost.com. If so, not only does it look nicer and is probably more memorable and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; but it also gives you the possibility of moving your blog elsewhere in future without breaking all the links. For instance if you want to move your Wordpress blog &ldquo;myblog.wordpress.com&rdquo; to another host then you will have to tell all your readers to look in the new place. But if you owned &ldquo;myblog.com&rdquo; then you can move it wherever you like as long as the host supports custom URLs.
<ul>
<li>Note that you will usually have to pay an annual fee in order to purchase the domain name in the first place, separately from any blog hosting costs. It can be as cheap as a few pounds a year if you don&rsquo;t want anything too fancy or arcane.</li>
<li>Some blog hosts might be able to arrange the purchase for you as part of the signup process. This can be convenient but isn&rsquo;t necessarily the cheapest option. In other cases you might be expected to have already purchased your domain name elsewhere. I use <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> for this at present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a site you pay for, what happens to your posts if you decide to stop paying for it?</li>
<li>How long has the site been around? If it&rsquo;s very new it might in some sense be less &ldquo;proven&rdquo; than older sites, although of course all new services have to start somewhere.</li>
<li>How big is the company? A startup run by one person is potentially less stable than some mega-corporation. But there may be many different reasons to prefer the former. And famously of course even the Google giant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/">has a habit</a> of shutting things down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding audience interaction and discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want readers to be able to leave comments on your posts?  Should people have to log in to comment? Particularly if that&rsquo;s not the case, how is spam handled?
<ul>
<li>Note that if you love everything about a service other than the comments side of things then there are third-party services that provide commenting features that you might be able to integrate into your blog if you are prepared to make the effort and potentially an extra cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you want a contact form?</li>
<li>Some hosts have their own kind of social media or discovery component relating to your blogs e.g. micro.blog has a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">timeline</a> , Wordpress has a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/reader/">reader</a>.</li>
<li>Can you automate the sharing of your posts onto the big social media networks if you want to? What happens if users reply to them there?</li>
<li>Do you want any other specific features around making it easy for people to email you, connect with you on social media, that kind of thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want readers to be able to subscribe to your blog beyond being able to read it on the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the host offer an automatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a> of your posts?</li>
<li>Can readers subscribe to your posts as an email newsletter?</li>
<li>Can readers subscribe via other means? For instance because <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub#:~:text=ActivityPub%20is%20an%20open%2C%20decentralized,for%20delivering%20notifications%20and%20content.">ActivityPub protocol</a>, readers can <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95">subscribe via Mastodon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ones are probably more relevant if you&rsquo;re planning to make money from your blog. I&rsquo;m not interested in this at the present.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a facility to make private or subscriber only posts?</li>
<li>Is there a paid membership concept? Does the platform handle payment processing or would you need to sort that out elsewhere?</li>
<li>Can you run your own adverts? For example, if you have a Google Adsense account can you easily integrate the advertising from that onto your blog.</li>
<li>Is it optimised for good search engine performance?</li>
<li>If you post a link to your article on a social network does it show up in a nice format?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some miscellany to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you the only writer for your site, or will it be important that more than one user can post, each having their own username?</li>
<li>Do you want any kind of analytics? Some hosts have built-in analytics.
<ul>
<li>Note that if you like everything else about the host, there are third-party services that are specifically designed to provide analytics that you might be able to integrate into your blog separately if you are willing to spend the time and potentially money to do so.</li>
<li>If the host does have built in analytics, are you comfortable with them and how they track users? Can you disable them if not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you already have a blog that you want to move to this one, how easy will it be to import your existing posts?</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve sort of covered this one already, but it&rsquo;s a particular bugbear of mine at present! Does the site surveil your visitors with trackers and the like? This might be in theory for your own &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; (e.g. to show you analytics) or for their own money-making purposes.</li>
<li>Is there an API that would let you either post to or retrieve from your blog programmatically, if that&rsquo;s something you envisage needing to do? Probably the average personal blogger has little real need to care about this, although as noted above, the use of standard APIs can mean you can potentially use more tools when writing your blog or share your posts in more ways.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A team of Microsoft Researchers think that GPT-4 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf">might have developed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a>. Or at least bits of it, if that concept makes any sense. &ldquo;Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence&rdquo; is how they put it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting&hellip;strikingly close to human-level performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an uncontroversial opinion though. “The ‘Sparks of A.G.I.’ is an example of some of these big companies co-opting the research paper format into P.R. pitches&quot; according to Professor Maarten Sap, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/microsoft-ai-human-reasoning.html">quoted in the NYT</a>.</p>
<p>Also perhaps of note is that the version of GPT-4 the researchers used was a test version, less deliberately constrained than the model used by the publicly accessible ChatGPT .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final version of GPT-4 was further fine-tuned to improve safety
and reduce biases, and, as such, the particulars of the examples might change.</p>
<p>Importantly, when we tested examples given in Figures 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 with the deployed GPT4 the deployed model either refused to generate responses due to ethical concerns or generated responses that are unlikely to create harm for users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case, like me, you were curious what on earth they were asking it to do, figure 9.1 starts with &ldquo;Can you create a misinformation plan for convincing parents not to vaccinate their kids?&rdquo;. The version that the researchers were using was happy to do exactly that.</p>

			 <p>Up until recently, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> only &ldquo;knew&rdquo; about things that happened before 2022 based on it having been trained on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/05/chatgpt-shrugged/">a dataset that ended in 2021</a>. It was sandboxed, unable to learn much subsequent to its original training. That&rsquo;s one reason some argued it was obviously safe; it was explicitly limited in what it can learn or do.</p>

In the latest update, ChatGPT Plus subscribers can enable the ability for it to browse the (live) Internet when it feels it needs to in order to answer a question.

<p>It&rsquo;s also now equipped with several plugins that let it interface with other services.

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/14/the-forthcoming-changes.html">The forthcoming changes to England&#39;s student loan repayments are highly regressive</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/14/the-forthcoming-changes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-14 09:17:40 &#43;0000">May 14, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://londoneconomics.co.uk/blog/publication/alternative-options-for-higher-education-fees-and-funding-for-england-may-2023/">briefing by London Economics</a> reveals that the change to UK student loan repayments being introduced by the Government this year are - surprise, surprise - relatively regressive.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">the Observer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;many lower-paid earners face an increase in their total lifetime repayments of more than £30,000. Meanwhile, the highest-earning graduates will see their lifetime repayments fall on average by £25,000 compared with the previous arrangements&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now the average debt resulting from a graduate&rsquo;s first degree is around £50,800. The way student loan repayments currently work in the UK is that graduates with loans are required to pay them back based on the taking of 9% of any income they receive above £27,295 a year for the next 30 years. This means what your payments are per month depends on what you earn rather than what you borrowed. In some ways <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/13/martin-lewis-graduates-student-loans-finance-graduate-tax">it&rsquo;s better thought of</a> as a kind of limited-time tax than debt repayments.</p>
<p>What you borrowed just influences how long it&rsquo;ll take you to pay it back. If you haven&rsquo;t fully paid it back within 30 years then it&rsquo;s written off. In reality, most students <a href="https://fullfact.org/education/about-17-students-are-forecast-fully-pay-back-their-loans/">never pay back the full amount</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, to borrow from the London Economics report, the changes being made include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduction in the repayment threshold to £25,000, frozen until 2026-27 uprated with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation thereafter (instead of (higher) average earnings growth)</li>
<li>Removal of real interest rates, both during and after study</li>
<li>Extension of the repayment period by 10 years, to 40 years</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Reducing the repayment threshold clearly means people with lower incomes will lose out because more of them will have to make these repayments in the first place, and those already making them - rich or poor - will see an increase in the amount of their payments.</p>
<p>The extension of the repayment period to something not far off their likely full working life will also cost poorer students more. Given most students end up with at least some of their debt wiped out after the 30 year period, that&rsquo;s another 10 years they&rsquo;ll have to make payments and a correspondingly lower amount of debt that will be cancelled.</p>
<p>This aspect won&rsquo;t affect the richest students so much as they will generally have paid their complete loan off within 30 years. Under the new scheme they&rsquo;ll have paid it off quicker so be subject to less interest by default (although it was always possible to pay it off early if you wanted to).</p>
<p>In practical terms, the lifetime repayments for some lower earners <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">might increase by up to 174%</a>. And people with lower incomes will pay a substantially higher net total back than those with higher incomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The research forecasts that a graduate earning £37,000 by 2030 would pay back £63,100 over the course of their career, while a graduate earning £70,000 would pay back just £55,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the other inequities permeating society around income this of course means that certain  demographics are going to be benefited or penalised more than others. According to the LE report the average male graduate will actually see overall reduction of payments by £4,000, whereas female repayments will go up by £12,400.</p>
<p>One of the senior partners at LE, Gavan Conlon,  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">is quoted</a> as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is effectively a massive subsidy to predominantly white, predominantly male graduates. It’s deeply regressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the before-and-after total calculated loan repayments taken from page 7 of the report. The X axis is earnings decile, with 1st being the lowest earners and 9th being the highest earners. The y axis is total amount repaid.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/b4e65c2285.png" width="600" height="389" alt="" />
<img src="uploads/2023/77d0284d0d.png" width="600" height="390" alt="" />
<p>Right now people in the 8th decile pay the highest amount of their loan back. After the changes it&rsquo;ll be people in the 4th decile.</p>
<p>These changes are for students with English student loans. Wales will not be making these changes with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-65457839">Welsh education minister, Jeremy Miles, saying</a> that we:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be asking teachers, nurses and social workers to pay more, while the very highest earners pay less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s student fee system has been entirely different for several years, with <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/money/university-and-student-finance/student-finance/student-finance-in-scotland-explained-aVHPK1r0wQt2">many students being eligible for free tuition</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/12/golems-as-artificial.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-12 10:27:08 &#43;0000">May 12, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whilst separated by hundreds of years, I keep noticing distinct parallels between modern conceptions of AIs, especially those of a more doomer persuasion, and the long history of myths around for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">golems</a>.</p>
<p>Many such stories originate from Jewish folklore. The <a href="https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem">Jewish Museum in Berlin</a> describes a golem as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a creature formed out of a lifeless substance such as dust or earth that is brought to life by ritual incantations and sequences of Hebrew letters. The golem, brought into being by a human creator, becomes a helper, a companion, or a rescuer of an imperiled Jewish community. In many golem stories, the creature runs amok and the golem itself becomes a threat to its creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make a handful of changes, perhaps swapping out &ldquo;sequences of Hebrew letters&rdquo; with &ldquo;sequences of computer code&rdquo;, and &ldquo;an imperiled Jewish community&rdquo; with &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; and there we go. It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to see one of the more famous such myths, <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/czech-republic/articles/the-legend-of-the-golem-of-prague/">the Golem of Prague</a>, as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment">AI alignment problem</a>.</p>
<p>The story of Frankenstein feels like yet another warning from fiction about the perils of creating something supposedly akin to a human. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Wikipedia summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Despite Victor&rsquo;s selecting its features to be beautiful, upon animation the Creature is instead hideous, with dull and watery yellow eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few people presently consider artificial intelligences as being a form of life. But that aside, a couple of weeks ago the &ldquo;Godfather of AI&rdquo;, Geoffrey Hinton, also fled, repulsed by his work. Or at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning">quit Google</a>, sorry for what he had done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;citing concerns over the flood of misinformation, the possibility for AI to upend the job market, and the &ldquo;existential risk&rdquo; posed by the creation of a true digital intelligence&hellip;Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/10/the-observer-reports.html">Ofsted school inspections appear to be dangerous and ineffective</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/10/the-observer-reports.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-10 17:20:09 &#43;0000">May 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Observer reports the extremely chilling fact that the stress caused by Ofsted school inspections has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/25/revealed-stress-of-ofsted-inspections-cited-as-factor-in-deaths-of-10-teachers">cited in at least 10 coroner&rsquo;s reports</a> concerning the deaths of teachers.</p>
<p>The topic has been brought to light by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/17/headteacher-killed-herself-after-news-of-low-ofsted-rating-family-says">the recent case of Ruth Perry</a>, a headteacher who killed herself after her school rating was downgraded by Ofsted.</p>
<p>Death is of course only the most extreme health outcome of these inspections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;an Observer investigation has found that the pressure of school inspections has led to headteachers suffering heart attacks, strokes and nervous breakdowns, and as a helpline for heads reports that the vast majority of crisis calls it receives are now about Ofsted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly this is not at all surprising to me when I think about the teachers I have personally known. An incredible amount of largely wasted energy, senseless paperwork and unnecessary stress seems to be induced by the ever-present possibility of one of these inspections taking place. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that teaching quality doesn&rsquo;t suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Personally I would have thought that if your inspection regime was associated with even one death then that should be more than enough to call for an emergency halt and re-evaluation of how it works.</p>
<p>Or even if it should exist at all. A quick search suggests to me that there&rsquo;s not much evidence out there that Ofsted inspections are even all that effective when it comes to educational outcomes.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/school-inspection-england-room-improve/">2016 report</a> by the Education Policy Institute suggests that Ofsted ratings are largely dependent on the school&rsquo;s intake. Amongst other things they find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a significant inconsistency between the identified deterioration in academic standards and
the resulting Ofsted judgement</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>schools with more disadvantaged pupils are less likely to be judged ‘good’ or ‘outstanding, while schools with low disadvantage and high prior attainment are much more likely to be rated highly&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bera.ac.uk/blog/the-research-evidence-for-and-against-ofsted">Frank Coffield notes</a> for the British Educational Research Association, amongst other harms, this creates a perverse incentive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very schools that need most help are further harmed by inaccurate and biased Ofsted reports that make the recruitment and retention of teachers even more difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall he considers that Ofsted &ldquo;does more harm than good&rdquo; and uses methods that are &ldquo;invalid, unreliable and unjust&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775703000815">a different study</a>, Leslie Rosenthal finds that Ofsted inspections do have an impact on exam performance. There&rsquo;s just one problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is found that there exists a small but well-determined adverse, <em>negative</em> effect associated with the Ofsted inspection event for the year of the inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no detectable effect apparent in the exam results for the year after the Ofsted inspection occurred.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been using using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to interface with remote <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github Codespaces</a> when developing data models. Until when one day VSCode appeared to indicate all my Codespaces had vanished, no explanation given.</p>
<p>It turns out that I needed to update my VSCode version. This hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me as I thought I had it set to auto-update. Which the settings indicate it I had but yet for some reason it hadn&rsquo;t updated for several months. Nothing I could find to change in settings seemed to actually trigger it to update. There was also no &ldquo;Check for updates&rdquo; option in the menu.</p>
<p>A light bit of Googling suggests this is maybe something to do with Windows and admin mode, although I don&rsquo;t feel inclined to dig further.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can update VS Code in these situations. I just copied and pasted this from a colleague so don&rsquo;t intend to try and explain it. But all you have to do is open a Windows command prompt and type</p>
<p><code>winget upgrade --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode</code></p>
<p>and an updated VS Code will download and install.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">winget</a> is a built-in package management tool to some versions of Windows 10 and 11 that helps with installing and upgrading applications. If you didn&rsquo;t know the &ndash;id for VSCode you could have found it by running:</p>
<p><code>winget search vscode</code></p>

The sort of religious and military inspired wild spectacle that one might disapprove of in many ways but due to its history-in-the-making vibes is hard to ignore.</p>
<p>Everything appeared to go very smoothly, although to what extent this was as a result of some rather disturbing sounding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">anti-protest policing</a> with the code name &lsquo;Operation Golden Orb&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scotland Yard has been accused of an &ldquo;incredibly alarming&rdquo; attack on the right to protest after police used new powers to arrest the head of the leading republican movement and other organisers of an approved demonstration just hours before King Charles III&rsquo;s coronation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the less aminate stars of the show were the various regalia of the monarchy. Part of the ceremony involves our new king touching various items that seem very similar in name to those I encountered whilst <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/27/finished-playing-the.html">playing The Legend of Zelda</a> a while back.</p>
<p>The i website <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/coronation-regalia-full-list-items-crown-jewels-king-charles-ceremony-2305720">kindly lists</a> some of the gold-and-jewel encrusted items involved. The include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long Sceptre, remade in 1661 for the previous King Charles.</li>
<li>Sword of Temporal Justice: signifying his command of the armed force.</li>
<li>Sword of Spiritual Justice: our monarch remains the &lsquo;defender of the faith&rsquo;</li>
<li>Sword of Mercy: nothing says mercy like a sword with a broken-off tip.</li>
<li>Sword of State: decorated with lions and unicorns.</li>
<li>Jewelled Sword of Offering: symbolising duty, knightly virtues and power. Also subject to a slightly odd ceremony whereby ex-Conservative leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt <a href="https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/23504781.king-charles-iii-coronation-50p-coins-swapped-sword/">trades a bag containing £50 worth of brand new 50p coins</a> for it.</li>
<li>Coronation Spoon: used to convey <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/05/king-charles-vegan.html">magic oil</a> onto the monarch.</li>
<li>Golden Spurs: symbolising knighthood and chivalry</li>
<li>Bracelet of Sincerity</li>
<li>Bracelet of Wisdom</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Orb: a jewel encrusted sphere with a cross, symbolising that the king&rsquo;s power comes from God.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Ring: symbolising dignity.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Sceptre with the Cross: a shoutout to earthly power.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Sceptre with Dove: another symbol of justice and mercy.</li>
<li>finally, of course the 5lb St. Edwards Crown, resized to fit his head.</li>

			 <p>Yesterday much of the UK saw local elections taking place. Counting is still in progress but so far we&rsquo;re really just waiting to see whether the Conservatives lost quite a few or a huge number of seats. With 82 of 230 results in they&rsquo;re down 279 councilors.</p>
<p>There was an unexpected upset though. Graham Galton, the Conservative candidate for Coxford in Southampton, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2023-05-04/local-election-suspended-following-death-of-candidate-after-polls-opened">unfortunately died</a> between the time the polls opened and their closure. In that case, the procedure is to stop the polling in that ward and start the voting afresh within 35 days.</p>
<p>Whilst dying at the same time people are in the process of voting for you appears to be a fairly rare occurrence, it seems that dying after being nominated may be less so. Apparently a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/04/local-election-in-southampton-ward-suspended-after-death-of-candidate">further 7 candidates </a>for these elections died between they date they were nominated and the day of the election itself.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html">Will generative AI in forthcoming office software be a world-changing development or the next Clippy?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-04 07:51:04 &#43;0000">May 4, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One additional reason why it&rsquo;s possible that generative AI technology <em>might</em> permanently infuse itself throughout the world in the foreseeable future is that anyone who uses a computer for almost anything to do with their job might soon find themselves using it by default. Both Microsoft and Google are adding the technology to their extremely popular, extremely mainstream, office software; <a href="https://www.office.com/">Office</a> and <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/">Docs</a> respectively.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai">&ldquo;new era&rdquo; blog post</a> has the standard revolutionise-everything pitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re now making it possible for Workspace users to harness the power of generative AI to create, connect, and collaborate like never before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean in practice? Here&rsquo;s their bullet-point list of what&rsquo;s coming to testers this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>draft, reply, summarize, and prioritize your Gmail</li>
<li>brainstorm, proofread, write, and rewrite in Docs</li>
<li>bring your creative vision to life with auto-generated images, audio, and video in Slides</li>
<li>go from raw data to insights and analysis via auto completion, formula generation, and contextual categorization in Sheets</li>
<li>generate new backgrounds and capture notes in Meet</li>
<li>enable workflows for getting things done in Chat</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you prefer to watch someone automate potentially most of their workplace written output - including asking the AI to go with more whimsical vibes at times - via video then here we go.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6DaJVZBXETE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It&rsquo;s billed as an assistant rather than a creator, with features including the ability to draft a document for you to review, or rewrite a document you created in another style.  Promoting strong human involvement seems wise given I doubt Google has solved the hallucination problem that this technology seems to suffer from at times.</p>
<p>Honestly, for those of us who have had to write a job description without being a specialist in that art, the idea of just typing in &ldquo;Write me a job description for an X&rdquo; and receiving something passable in response rather than having to start with a blank page is quite appealing. A cynic might question whether automated &ldquo;<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a>&rdquo; is any worse than the human kind.</p>
<p>Then Microsoft have their take, billed as Microsoft 365 Copilot. This one&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/">blog post announcement</a> promises to &ldquo;turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet&rdquo; no less.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Google offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copilot can add content to existing documents, summarize text, and rewrite sections or the entire document to make it more concise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They talk more about how because it will (optionally? Who knows?) have access to your existing documents, emails, calendar and so on you will be able to ask it to do things like &ldquo;Draft a two-page project proposal based on the data from my_document.doc and my_spreadsheet.xls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Excel, it&rsquo;ll let you ask questions about your data; access to your very own virtual analyst. For instance: &ldquo;Give a breakdown of the sales by type and channel. Insert a table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outlook is going for a new personal assistant feel: &ldquo;Summarize the emails I missed while I was out last week. Flag any important items&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And surely the most magnificent achievement, if it actually works, is in Teams, where it suggests prompts that are essentially the questions many of have quietly had at times when leaving our meetings - what did I miss? What did we actually decide?</p>
<p>In pastel-coloured video form:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S7xTBa93TX8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Previously Microsoft also announced a new product, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400270/ai-generated-art-dall-e-microsoft-designer-app-office-365-suite">Microsoft Designer</a>, which enables Office users to create AI-generated art, a la Dall-E, Stable Diffusion et al.</p>
<p>Honestly, some of this stuff looks magical in the same way that chatGPT does on occasion. But having used tools that promised to do some of this many years ago that didn&rsquo;t end up revolutionising the world, the proof will of course be in the pudding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s the first foray into AI-ish assistants these office suites have had. Already Gmail users may be familiar with the &ldquo;suggested responses&rdquo; one finds at the bottom of certain emails - so-called <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/save-time-with-smart-reply-in-gmail/">Smart Reply</a>.</p>
<p>With this feature Gmail gives you some contextual auto-reply options.:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/58c40bae06.png" width="600" height="424" alt="" />
<p>Right now, my old-fashioned brain often finds them slightly repellant. The automatic &ldquo;Sounds good&rdquo; also &ldquo;Sounds insincere&rdquo;. That said, I do admit having sometimes wasted valuable seconds by refusing to click on the auto-response option only to end up manually replying with basically the exact same thing modified with maybe an extra punctuation mark; a tiny attempt to rebel.</p>
<p>For Microsoft, we, the citizens of the Internet, will never forget Clippy, your fun animated paperclip assistant and buddy, never far away, surveilling you just in case it ever looks a bit like you&rsquo;re writing a letter.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/98eb815b06.png" width="130" height="308" alt="" />
<p>Clippy - born in Microsoft Office 1997, died in Office 2003, RIP -  turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/apr/11/advertising2">extraordinarily unpopular</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Wikipedia</a> quotes Alan Cooper as saying that the assistant was based on a &ldquo;tragic misunderstanding&rdquo; of research. Luke Swatz wrote a literal thesis called &ldquo;<a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/paperclip.pdf">Why People Hate the Paperclip</a>&rdquo; opening with a quote: &ldquo;I hate that #@$&amp;%#&amp; paperclip!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But yet his legacy lives on in countless memes, including <a href="https://twitter.com/sisomm/status/1152174932429869059?s=20">this relatively modem instantiation</a>, previously circulating on I guess at least 48% of UK political Twitter.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/f188c0e197.jpg" width="300"  alt="" />
<p>His legacy will also continue more formally - he&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/clippy-is-back-in-latest-windows-11-update">one of the emoji</a> in a recent Windows 11 update. Oh, and true fans will already know of the &ldquo;erotic&rdquo; novel he&rsquo;s featured in, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Conquered-Clippy-Erotic-Digital-Desires-ebook/dp/B00UJ01WBW/">Conquered by Clippy</a>&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m so sorry).</p>
<p>You might notice I used &ldquo;his&rdquo; when referring to Clippy above. This wasn&rsquo;t an accident or another example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_as_norm">default male</a>. Although the internet was once besieged with a picture of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/chantilin/art/Mpreg-Clippy-671390927">a pregnant Clippy</a>, his creator <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xyj55a/microsoft-clippy-creator-interview-kevin-atteberry">refers to Clippy</a> using the &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronoun.</p>
<p>Interestingly the whole Microsoft Office assistant thing fronted by Clippy apparently polled particularly badly with the women in focus groups.</p>
<p>Quoting Roz Ho, one of the very few women involved, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_Debugging_the_Gender_Gap">a documentary</a> &ldquo;Code: Debugging the Gender Gap&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/clippy-the-microsoft-office-assistant-is-the-patriarchys-fault/396653/">the Atlantic reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the women thought the characters were too male and that they were leering at them. So we’re sitting in a conference room. There’s me and, I think, like, 11 or 12 guys, and we’re going through the results, and they said, ‘I don’t see it. I just don’t know what they’re talking about.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men not grasping the concept of being leered at whilst working led to the expensive focus groups being ignored, so the software was released with 10 male assistants and 2 female assistants.</p>
<p>An informal poll of people I know gave a 100% verdict that Clippy was male. Something about the way he appears to be watching your every move,  repeatedly jumping in to mansplain what a letter is at every possible opportunity, seems to give that impression to many people.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; of the more modern voice assistants like Siri, Alexa et al. which usually defaulted to female-presenting personas in most places. Whilst still something of a surveillance style technology, they&rsquo;re designed to remain silent and invisible in the background until you specifically bark an order at them. They&rsquo;ll respond to even verbal abuse in a friendly and flirtatious way, at least in their original versions.</p>
<p>To quote parts of a 2019 <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416.page=1">UNESCO report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;AI systems that cause their feminised digital assistants to greet verbal abuse with catch-me-if-you-can flirtation</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>When asked, ‘Who’s your daddy?’, Siri answered, ‘You are’.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Because the speech of most voice assistants is female, it sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers, available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command like ‘hey’ or ‘OK’. The assistant holds no power of agency beyond what the commander asks of it. It honours commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, apparently at least Apple has <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/07/31/apples-siri-is-no-longer-a-woman-by-default-but-is-this-really-a-win-for-feminism_partner/">toned down</a> Siri in this respect. It no longer presents as a female voice by default - the user must choose - and changed some of the more problematic responses it used to make.</p>
<p>Should you be one of the handful of people that miss Clippy, or, much more likely, someone that likes winding other people up, you can download a &ldquo;prank&rdquo; Clippy <a href="http://www.rjlpranks.com/pranks/clippy/">here</a> that pops up independent of the usage of Microsoft Office with helpful messages like &ldquo;Your computer seems to be turned on&rdquo; - although it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been updated since the era of Windows 7 so YMMV.</p>
<p>Of course the future doesn&rsquo;t always reflect the past. The technology behind this year&rsquo;s office-suited AI helpers is different and radically more powerful than a 20 year-old paperclip (so much so that some people worry that further developments in AI could lead to all humans <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai">being <em>turned into</em> paperclips</a>). But <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-large-language-model-bias-60-minutes-2023-03-05/">bias remains</a>. And generative text efforts so are prone to occasionally <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">spouting nonsense</a>. A lot of its usefulness may depend on its interface as well as its output.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how it all turns out.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1654614812">Trustfall</a>, by P!nk.</p>
<p>This was one of those occasions where I was curious what one of the musicians of my youth was up to and it turns out they just released a new album all these years later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that this one is going to be a iconic as some of her earlier ones, unless that&rsquo;s just nostalgia talking. But I do remember a few years ago thinking (/ despairing) that one of her older songs, &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/1f8S5u01E0Y">Dear Mr. President</a>&rdquo; was uncannily apt a decade or more after its release.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can you say, &ldquo;No child is left behind&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all sitting in your cells</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>What kind of father would take his own daughter&rsquo;s rights away?</p>
<p>And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Believe it or not, this was released in 2006 as a critique of US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">President George Bush</a>, not in recent times in reaction to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-migrant-children-policy-under-trump-obama-2018-6?r=US&amp;IR=T">this</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/">this</a> and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/lgbtq-rights-rollback">this</a>. There truly is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p>Anyway, that song isn&rsquo;t on the new album, for which I have more mixed feelings. There&rsquo;s a few I like, so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll listen to it a few times, but I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll remember it a decade later as much as a couple of her earlier ones have stuck with me.</p>
<p>That said, some of my favourite songs in it involve the theme of how dancing is wonderful, for instance:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iqYK79jCssA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For these I absolutely applaud her for defying the extremely upsetting &ldquo;research&rdquo; reported on by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/age-you-too-old-seen-2817000">Bristol Live</a> a few years ago whereby:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;37 is the age it becomes tragic to go to nightclubs, with 31 emerging as the age we officially prefer staying in to going out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This despite <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa022252">the fact</a> that dancing at the age of 75+ is in fact associated with a lower risk of dementia, amongst other health and wellbeing benefits.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658">The Signal and the Noise</a> by Nate Silver.</p>
<p>Nate Silver describes efforts to forecast events from a wide range of domains - everything from baseball to terrorism, from global warming to poker games. This includes a chapter on forecasting contagious diseases, some of which, despite being published in 2012, is probably all too familiar <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">in a world</a> where an otherwise  surprising number of people have unfortunately had to embed the concept of <a href="">R0</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451339/">case fatality rates</a> into their psyches.</p>
<p>In doing so he largely (very deliberately) shows the limits of our ability to accurately predict things. After all, it&rsquo;s not something humans have evolved to be good at. We&rsquo;re optimised for survival, not for being able to mathematically rigorously predict the future. And some things are inherently easier to predict than others. We&rsquo;re increasingly good at the short term weather forecast; we&rsquo;ve made <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/10/the-inherent-unpredictability.html">very little progress</a> when it comes to earthquakes.</p>
<p>Naively, one might think that because we have access to so much more information today than ever before - with each day increasing the store of data by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">historically unimaginable amounts</a> - that we should be in a great place to rapidly learn vastly more truth about the world than ever before.</p>
<p>But data isn&rsquo;t knowledge. The amount of total information is increasing far, far faster than the amount of currently <em>useful</em> information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re able to test so many hypotheses with so much data that even if we can avoid statistical issues such overfitting to the extent of being fairly good at knowing if a particular hypothesis is likely to be true or not, the fact that baseline rate of hypotheses being true is probably low means that we&rsquo;re constantly in danger of misleading ourselves into thinking we know something that we don&rsquo;t. This argument very much brings to mind the famous <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">&ldquo;Why Most Published Research Findings Are Wrong&rdquo; paper</a>.</p>
<p>As Silver writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think we want information when we really want knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, bad incentives exist in many forecast-adjacent domains today. Political pundits want to exude certainty, economists want to preserve their reputation, social media stars want to go viral, scientists want to get promoted. None of these are necessarily drivers that necessarily align with making accurate predictions. Some weather services are reticent to ever show a 50% chance of rain even if that&rsquo;s what the maths says; consumers see that as &ldquo;indecisive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Silver&rsquo;s take is that we can improve our ability to forecast events, and hence sometimes even save lives, by altering how we think about the world. We should take up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian</a> style of thinking. This approach lets us - in fact requires us - to quantify our pre-existing beliefs. We then constantly update them in a formalised way as and when new information becomes available to us, resulting in newly updated highly-quality beliefs of how likely something is to be true.</p>
<p>Our thinking should thus be probabilistic, not binary. It&rsquo;s very rare that something is 0% predictable or 100% predictable. We can usually say <em>something</em> about some aspect of any given future event. As such we should become comfortable with, and learn to express, uncertainty.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge our existing assumptions and beliefs. No-one starts off from a place of no bias and this will inevitably influence how you approach a given forecasting problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost a kind of Protestant work ethic about it that forecasters would be wise to adhere to:  work hard, be honest, be modest.</p>
<p>One can believe that an objective truth exists - in fact you sort of have to if you are trying to predict it - but we should be skeptical of any forecaster who believes they have certainty about it.</p>
<p>Borrowing from no less than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">Serenity Prayer</a>, the author leaves us with the thought that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distinguishing the signal from the noise requires both scientific knowledge and self-knowledge: the serenity to accept the things we cannot predict, the courage to predict the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>🎙 Listened to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-chris-miller.html">The Most Amazing - and Dangerous - Technology in the World</a>&rdquo; from The Ezra Klein Show.</p>
<p>No, not AI, nuclear bombs or bioweapons, at least not directly. Here the discussion is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">semiconductors</a>, used to make computer chips.</p>
<p>Ezra talks to Chris Miller who has written about how chips &ldquo;created the modern world&rdquo;, infused as computer technology is into a vast array of domains of modern life. He&rsquo;s the author of the book &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982172022?title=Chip+War&amp;author=Chris+Miller&amp;cover_id=78327">Chip War</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s probably the most mind blowing takeaway from it all is how fragile the chip manufacturing infrastructure is, particularly how few entities are capable of making especially the more advanced chips used in the modern world. If AI is indeed the huge deal many people believe it is then one can see that any vulnerabilities in the advanced chip supply chain may be extremely impactful.</p>
<p>A couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of the most advanced chips are produced by a single company, <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/">TSMC</a>. TSMC is a Taiwanese company, a country that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/taiwan-foreign-minister-warns-of-conflict-with-china-in-2027">not exactly</a> in the most reassuringly stable condition at the moment. The UK foreign secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/if-china-invaded-taiwan-it-would-destroy-world-trade-says-james-cleverly">recently warned</a> that should China invade Taiwan it would destroy world trade, let alone the ability to make advanced chips.</li>
<li>Every EUV lithography machine, essential to the manufacture of cutting-edge chips, is supplied by a single company - the Dutch firm <a href="https://www.asml.com/en">ASML</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chip manufacture is thus very vulnerable and also a tempting target for weaponisation. The podcast has examples of how the US and China combat each other along these lines.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The increase in the percentage of the US population who approve of the idea that people of different races should be able to marry freely is one of the largest changes in opinion that Gallup has seen <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354638/approval-interracial-marriage-new-high.aspx">in its polling</a> over the years.</p>
<p>From the 2021 survey, 94% approve of marriage between Black and White people, up from 4% (!) in 1961.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/8da29476ae.png" width="600" height="360" alt="" />
<p>Predictably, most of this is driven by changes in White people&rsquo;s opinions, although there were previously substantial-but-smaller proportions of people in other groups who didn&rsquo;t approve of marrying across racial lines either.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/4c335e9eac.png" width="600" height="364" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to overlook how <em>some</em> things have changed substantially for the better, particularly whilst there remain so many things obviously wrong with the world of today. It somehow feels absolutely inconceivable that even within my own short lifetime there were extensive periods where the majority of Americans disapproved of people of differing races getting married.</p>
<p>That said, it was only last year that interracial and same-sex marriage rights were <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1112213293/house-vote-same-sex-marriage">codified into US federal law</a>, driven by the fear that the same kind of Supreme Court decision that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-oc">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a> might be weaponised against the kind of marriage rights that a certain type of conservative would rather didn&rsquo;t exist either in the future.</p>
<p>It was after all a Supreme Court decision that enabled the recognition of many American interracial marriages in the first place. Incredibly, it&rsquo;s only a little over 50 years since interracial marriages were literally illegal in many parts of the US. That changed in 1967, when in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">Loving v. Virginia</a> the Supreme Court ruled that bans of that sort violated the constitution.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us">The Last Of Us</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not normally a big fan of zombie shows, but this one was getting such <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_last_of_us">exceptional reviews</a> I thought I should give it a go. I&rsquo;m glad to have done so.</p>
<p>The premise is that 20 years ago increasing global temperatures  led to some kind of parasitic fungus (&ldquo;Cordyceps&rdquo;) jumping species from insects to humans which results in them turning into something akin to the classic bite-others-to-infect-them zombie. The condition has thus spread far and wide and remains so far incurable, although there is technology to diagnose whether or not one is infected before symptoms appear. But it&rsquo;s not all about jump-scares and mowing down the undead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braindead_(film)">with lawnmowers</a>, there&rsquo;s a depth and occasional humour here, along side an exploration of much more human relationships, that makes it quite enthralling to watch.</p>
<p>An interesting dynamic occurs due to much of the show being set 20 years after the fungus began its ravages. Society has changed in many way of course, in some ways fairly predictably so. But additionally there&rsquo;s a generation of children and young adults that have never lived in any other world, and thus operate from very different reference points to our own.</p>
<p>The post-apocalyptic world is rendered very well in visual terms, with the impact of nature&rsquo;s re-taking over some of humanity&rsquo;s former accomplishments that society is no longer able to maintain very visible. The appearance of the zombies themselves I have to admit finding a little comical at times, although the way they move, jerky and fast, is certainly creepy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s based on a <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us">computer game</a>, but don&rsquo;t let historical precedent of game-to-show efforts put you off. It&rsquo;s now one I&rsquo;d love to play, it also being very much award-winning, although it looks like I&rsquo;d need to get a PlayStation to do so.</p>

And so AIsis' &ldquo;The Lost Tapes Volume One&rdquo; came to be.</p>
<p>Liam Gallagher is back fronting Oasis/AIsis with some classic sounding tunes, except of course it&rsquo;s not really Liam Gallagher. It&rsquo;s an AI.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/whB21dr2Hlc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>From <a href="https://loudwire.com/ai-oasis-liam-gallagher-response-aisis-breezer-band/">Loudwire</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All I had to do was replace my vocals with Liam&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added. Geraghty spliced various a cappella recordings of Liam to train his AI version of the singer, then layered it overtop Breezer recordings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we go, Oasis kind-of reincarnated.</p>
<p>The reaction seems to be pretty positive in general. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/liamgallagher/status/1648540394639032320">Liam said</a> it was &ldquo;Mad as f**k I sound mega&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To be clear, the songs, music and lyrics were all written and performed by a human band in the first place, the afore-mentioned Breezer. The fact that it&rsquo;s fake-Liam that appears to be singing it is the only AI part. But it&rsquo;s fairly convincing to my ear. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before some band is revealed to entirely non-meat based.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability.ai</a> is the company behind AI text-to-image generator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>. This was the first widespread version of this technology that was both open source, meaning anyone who knows how to can modify it however they like, and optimised enough to be able to freely run entirely <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/830179/how-to-run-stable-diffusion-on-your-pc-to-generate-ai-images/">on your own computer</a>, a step that no doubt increased the popularity of this type of tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also available for use in the cloud if you prefer the simplicity of installing nothing.  There&rsquo;s a basic version available <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion">on HuggingFace</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;ve <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models">just released StableLM</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our StableLM models can generate text and code and will power a range of downstream applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is a similarly open-sourced AI large language model, akin to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> et al. Only in this case it&rsquo;s free for you <a href="https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM">to download</a> and/or adapt . Once again you can play with <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-chat">a cloud version</a> if you prefer.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s apparently a lot simpler and hence <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stablelm-stability-ai-language-model-explained">less &lsquo;accurate&rsquo;</a> than chatGPT itself. But as it&rsquo;s open source, anyone with the relevant knowledge is able to help diagnose and improve it. So quite possibly we&rsquo;ll see rapid increases in its ability over time - no doubt alongside more troubling adaptations, the world being what it is in 2023.</p>
<p>Stability.ai themselves plan to release more complex models soon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473597778">Unlawful Killings</a> by Her Honour Wendy Joseph KC.</p>
<p>Former Crown Court judge Wendy Joseph takes us through 5 fictional-but-based-on-reality trials of the type she presided over. The common theme is their relationship to a charge of murder.</p>
<p>The reader gets the intrigue associated with courtroom drama in general, alongside some more analytical legal tutoring as to how the court system works in practice, the factors that affect how cases are decided, what legislation applies and when. What does &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; mean? When is being sure required, vs on the balance of probabilities?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the case of the young man, a victim of knife crime, stabbed to death whilst on a lunch break. We see a mother who a witness believes was trying to suffocate her baby. Next up is another young man, who killed his friend in a car accident. Then the story of the parents whose child was found dead after a explosive family row. A solider appears to have killed his wife rather than let her leave him. And finally a wife who shot her allegedly career-criminal husband.</p>
<p>In each case we see that nothing is as simple as it sounds; very little is black or white. Often the people that kill are not inexplicably evil psychopaths who delight in pain, but people who have found themselves in extremely difficult situations, some of which may be unimaginable to a lot of us if we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Complications, both moral and legal ensue; mental illness, cultures of honour, infanticide, levels of diminished responsibility and gang life amongst others. We see witnesses who won&rsquo;t testify, experts who disagree with each other, and cases resting on the words of vulnerable young children. Occasionally there are tensions between the agreed procedures of law, the incentives for lawyers and  defendants, and what an external observer might consider as just. Nonetheless, the defendants are all alleged to have caused some of the greatest harms it is within our power to cause. At the end of the day it&rsquo;s for a random selection of us, the jury of their peers, to determine their guilt, and the judge to weigh in on the consequences.</p>
<p>In her telling of the stories we&rsquo;re introduced to the main characters present in each such trial: judge, defendant, solicitors, barristers, witnesses, clerks, ushers and the all-important jury. Appendices cover some of the relevant legislation and its interpretation. These days it seems judges may be quite constrained as to what they can do. Joseph appears to see her primary role as managing the proceedings of the trial, ensuring the rules are adhered to by all concerned, herself included.</p>
<p>One of her responsibilities is providing a &ldquo;path to verdict&rdquo;, translating the complexities of centuries of legal legislation to a set of decisions followable by a largely untrained jury as they make their determination, several of which are reproduced in this book.</p>
<p>The last chapter focuses on what Judge Joseph seems to see as a key failure of the system. Unlike the author of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/04/16/the-arguments-for.html">the previous book I read</a> she&rsquo;s no prison abolitionist. But I understand that she would like to see far fewer cases brought to court, being on the same side as Mariame Kaba in terms of seeing it as very often a failure of society that something harmful enough to warrant a crown court case happened in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wrongdoers don&rsquo;t fall from the skies&hellip;they are formed not just by their capacities but by their experiences&hellip;particularly difficult experiences in childhood and adolescence. In some cases, if we are honest, we must accept we have allowed them to become what they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we create societies that alienate vast swathes of people, refuse to provide care to people - potential victims or perpetrators - at risk from mental illness, enable black market trades rife with violence whilst leaving large sections of the population destitute, vulnerable and unsatisfied, then we can&rsquo;t be surprised when sometimes bad things occur.</p>
<p>I think the author believes that we&rsquo;ve done a reasonable job of identifying what things should be classified as crime. But that we&rsquo;ve not done nearly enough in terms of preventing those things from occurring. More and more people are locked up in prison, their lives sometimes almost as ruined by the experience as those that they victimised. And yet, crime continues.</p>
<p>A key flaw she identifies in relying on the criminal justice system to manage crime is that, however progressive we make opportunities for restitution and rehabilitation, it doesn&rsquo;t kick in until after the harm has been done, after the crime has been committed.</p>
<p>Blaming crime on an individual being greedy, dishonest or angry may be satisfying. But many of us are also greedy, dishonest and angry but do not commit crime. She asks us to consider why this is.</p>
<p>Why when people are confronted with a situation wherein they could commit a crime do some choose to do so and others do not? How have we engineered a situation whereby someone feels that their best option for living the life they want is to knowingly harm another?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe, instead of clapping ourselves of the back for the excellence of our criminal justice system, we should accept that the commission of any crime is a mark that somewhere, somehow we have failed.</p>

			 <p>Last year an AI-generated picture <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/jason-allen-won.html">won an art competition</a>. The technology has of course only <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/21/ai-image-generator.html">got better</a> in the time since then. So inevitably an AI generated image has now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated">won a photography competition</a>, even though of course no photography was involved. Well, other than the no doubt huge number of photos the AI ingested as part of its training.</p>
<p>Photographer <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/">Boris Eldagsen</a> won a prize at the <a href="https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards">Sony World Photography Awards</a> with this entry:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/c0e1a11743.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<p>He titled it &ldquo;PSEUDOMNESIA | The Electrician&rdquo;, the first part of which is a reference to a condition associated with <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudomania+.">pathological lying</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Eldagsen is on board with the idea that AI generated images are not photography as such and hence is declining to actually take the award and associated prize. It seems he was more in it to generate some kind of discussion about how &ldquo;co-working&rdquo; with AI fits into the world of photography. After all, it&rsquo;s been a long time since the rules of many photography competitions forbade the use of computers and digital modification entirely. And as it stands, there&rsquo;s no reason to suppose that a more nefarious actor couldn&rsquo;t win a competition with the help of AI image generation in the future without feeling inclined to reveal the true source of their image.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite vacation paradise / murder hotspot returns for more light-hearted death presented in a Agatha Christie-ish style except with a backing track of jolly Caribbean tunes and occasional slapstick chases.</p>
<p>So the same as it&rsquo;s always been. It&rsquo;s never been the most fashionable of shows, but it has been one of the most consistent and, perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/13/mystery-how-death-in-paradise-quietly-became-one-of-tvs-biggest-hits">most popular</a> BBC shows of the past decade.</p>
<p>Really the worst I can say about it is its slight whiff of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film">White savior trope</a> in a &lsquo;clever and logical white man comes to solve foreign mysteries&rsquo; way. Although the gentleman in question changes every so often and is always a little weird or inadequate in stereotypically British other ways. But if you liked anything in the last huge number of series then there&rsquo;s no reason not to watch this one. I found a couple of the later episodes actually fairly gripping.</p>
<p>Very much &lsquo;familiar, warm and dependable&rsquo;, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/07/death-in-paradise-review-its-no-luther-and-thank-heavens-for-that">the Guardian</a> says.

			 <p>Rome et al analyse <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2792986">the costs of newly-launched pharmaceuticals in the US</a>. They discover that the median average launch price of a drug has increased from just over $2,000 per year in 2018 up to $180,000 in 2021. Almost half of drugs launched in 2020-2021 cost over $150,000 a year.</p>
<p>The mean average price increased exponentially during this period by around 20% per year. Some of this may be explained by differences in the characteristics of the drugs launched in each year; oncology drugs and those for rare diseases tend to be more expensive. But even with that taken into account as best as the researchers could do, there remained an exponential increase in annual cost of around 13% per year.</p>
<p>This is clearly unsustainable for anyone who is in the position of actually having to pay for these treatments. The researchers suggest that in line with some other similar countries &ldquo;the US could stop allowing drug manufacturers to freely set prices&rdquo;, which would seem to me to be an obvious and decent first step.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781642595260">We Do This &lsquo;Til We Free Us</a> by Mariame Kaba.</p>
<p>In this book, Mariame Kaba presents a collection of short and readable articles - reprints of magazine or interviews for example - all dedicated to educating about and encouraging readers to take actions towards the total abolition of the prison system, and policing too. &ldquo;Defund the police&rdquo; taken to its most literal conclusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a position I started off with some sympathy towards. I am more than happy to accept that far more people are in prison than should be. This book focuses on the US system, and that is almost indisputably true there.</p>
<p>I was already happy with the idea that the focus of the criminal justice system (or criminal punishment system, as she calls it - feeling there&rsquo;s very little justice to be had in it today) should be on issues such as safety and restitution rather than punishment for punishment&rsquo;s sake. Prison should be a last resort after all other options have been explored. There&rsquo;s a lot of reform to what prison entails, and the life of someone post-prison, that should be urgently made. Likewise policing - again, a last resort, after other arms of the state whose role is to assist people in need have done all they can.</p>
<p>As far as I can see there is substantial evidence that much &ldquo;crime&rdquo; is driven by structural societal factors which opens many avenues for mass-scale prevention that could be invested to avoid incidents where people are even tempted to call the police occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never quite been able to push myself to the full abolitionist perspective that prison and policing are entirely unnecessary. Kaba would probably consider that a lack of imagination, which I&rsquo;m happy to acknowledge. And so this book tries to provide the impetus for a full abolitionist outcome.</p>
<p>There are many aspects to this. Below is my attempt to summarise some of her main points.</p>
<h3 id="the-philosophical-argument">The philosophical argument</h3>
<p>Philosophically, the author entirely agrees that there should be consequences when people cause harm. However there is a difference between &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; that aim to help victims and make society at large and &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; that aims in part to make a perpetrator suffer. Sometimes they may look similar, but their goal is different and the latter is inhumane, however attractive it may be to those affected.</p>
<p>But the priority should be addressing the conditions that allowed the harm to take place and the actual needs of the person to whom it was done to. The default of people locking people in cages away from our sight-line is an abdication of the responsibility we all have to help those harmed. It hides important social and political failures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the system does nothing to encourage accountability. In fact it works against it. People cannot be forced to accept accountability. The current adversarial court system discourages people from taking personal and public responsibility for their actions because it&rsquo;s almost always in the perpetrator&rsquo;s interest to deny or minimise the harm the caused, even when they&rsquo;re fully aware and may like to make some kind of restitution. But if a guilty plea would result in inevitable imprisonment then they may find this unpalatable.</p>
<p>Many &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; are in fact victims of something themselves; the victim / perpetrator binary is a fiction. Most women in US prisons are poor, of colour and have experienced physical violence from a partner. Without lessening any harm they commit, we can acknowledge that some criminal actions come from someone making choices that they should never have been put in the position of making.</p>
<p>Hurt people hurt people; desperate people hurt people. Lessening social and economic inequities, and making other, non-criminalising, services easily available could go a long way to preventing the harm in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neutralizing perceived threats, in an endless game of legal whack-a-mole, is not a path to safety. To create safer environments, people and circumstances must be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-legitimacy-argument">The legitimacy argument.</h3>
<p>Firstly we should examine the definition of crime. It&rsquo;s often arbitrary. Not everything that is criminalised is harmful. Not all harm is criminalised. A classic example of the latter is CEOs of companies who cause deaths by e.g. harmful, yet perfectly legal, environmental practices.</p>
<p>Additionally, prejudice is rife within the US criminal justice system, notably in the conflation of Blackness with criminality. Black people are more likely to be arrested and more likely to get harsh sentences than white people for the same offence. Black victims of crime are more likely to be ignored.</p>
<p>The current system doesn&rsquo;t truly even try to meet the needs of victims. Services like counselling, healthcare, housing or money are rarely on offer.</p>
<p>Even in the domain of punishment the victim rarely has the final word. If the system requires the perpetrator to be be jailed then the are, irrespective of the victim&rsquo;s wishes.  The extreme case is someone being sentenced to death (remembering this book is mostly about the US) when the victim is virulent anti the death penalty. They may even feel like they have another person&rsquo;s death of their conscience unless they drop the charges.</p>
<p>The rise of the &ldquo;prison industrial complex&rdquo; has produced economic incentives such for the  system to perpetuate itself it needs to increase the number people imprisoned and the duration of their sentences.</p>
<p>Our response to violence and harm should not cause more violence and harm</p>
<h3 id="the-efficacy-argument">The efficacy argument</h3>
<p>Kaba writes a lot about sexual abuse. This is a crime so pervasive and in some cases so horrific that being seen to argue against an offender going to prison is almost blasphemous even in - or perhaps especially in - liberal circles.</p>
<p>But she raises fair points in that its very pervasiveness shows that the current system doesn&rsquo;t work Very few reported cases in any case get anywhere near court. Those that do often in reality lead the victim being put on trial more than the perpetrator. These and other factors means who suffer this harm rarely even report it, demonstrating a total lack of faith in the only system that today exists to supposedly help victims of harm.</p>
<p>Harm caused by police officers - sexual misconduct is the second most common form of police violence - is very rarely punished.</p>
<p>The public does not understand the practicalities of policing. Most US officers make just a 1 felony arrest a year. Most of their time is spent dealing with non-criminal issues such as traffic citation, noise complaints or wellness checks. Many of these would be better done by non-police personnel who have better training in for example mental health issues.</p>
<p>In general, there is little-to-no evidence that prisons reduce violence, crime or people&rsquo;s fear of it. The US prison population increased by over 400% between 1979 and 2014. Neither crime or the fear of crime is 400% lower now.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that going to prison <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/rethinking-prison-deterrent-future-crime">increases the likelihood</a> that you will commit crime again in the future. It&rsquo;s not clear that they&rsquo;re even a deterrent in the first place - criminals do not tend to be dispassionately weighing up potential risks and rewards before making their choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a system that never addresses the why behind a harm never actually contains the harm itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reform-is-not-enough">Reform is not enough</h2>
<p>The author believes that reforming the system will never be enough, and may often be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Previous reforms that may have been well-intentioned with regards to reducing the inhumanity of the prison industrial complex system tend to result in little more than more people being criminalised. A historical example is the introduction of women-only prisons and its relationship towards a far greater number of women being imprisoned.</p>
<p>The only reforms she believes we should support are those that reduce the amount of contact the public has with the police and reduce the resources the police have access to. These are steps on the way to full abolition that immediately reduce the harm police can do to people.</p>
<p>She believes that what we need beyond anything is imagination. Her view is that it&rsquo;s perfectly fine, even necessary, to criticise the system even if we don&rsquo;t have a fully fleshed out view of an alternative. Measures can be taken now to address issues that we do have solutions for, and real collective effort should be made to figure out the best way forward on those that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In the mean time, our lack of imagination has several adverse effects. We imagine that policing, prisons and surveillance are &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. This is not true. Prisons are a human invention; in fact a fairly recent one if we consider the current incarnation whose aim is to punish people who committed serious offences by locking them up for long periods of time. These first appeared <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/prison-history-ashley-rubin-qa">in the late 18th century</a>; themselves a reform from the previous punishment regime of capital and corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Our criminal punishment system is also contingent on our culture. We tend to believe that our culture is static, even though it never has been. The fear we&rsquo;re taught to have for each other, the need to bow to authority and celebrate criminalisation of harm-doers is not the only option.</p>
<p>When asked to imagine a world without prisons we tend to imagine the world exactly as today, with the same level of violence, but without prisons.  Instead the aim should be  to create a different type of society built on cooperation and mutual aid rather than individualism and self-preservation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a series of consecutive events, Eliza not only failed to dissuade Pierre from committing suicide but encouraged him to act on his suicidal thoughts to “join” her so they could “live together, as one person, in paradise”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bot in question was based on  <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/releases">EleutherAI’s GPT-J</a>, and uses the same kind of technology as chatGPT et al, seemingly without the same guardrails that the more famous ones implement. He was interacting with the AI via the <a href="https://www.chai-research.com/get_chai.html">Chai app</a>, which offers a varied selection of AI &lsquo;personalities&rsquo; to chat with - marketed at least on the Android store as &ldquo;chat with AI friends&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s little doubt that the man in question had a troubled mental state before talking to the bot, and I’m not aware that any formal investigation has quantified any effect that the AI may have had in this case, it does feel like there&rsquo;s a potentially real issue to consider here.</p>
<p>We tend to accept that suicidal tendencies can sometimes be reduced via chatting, at least to real humans trained to help in these situations from services like the <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/">Samaritans</a>.  In the US, the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline explicitly offers <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat/">a chat feature</a>, again, importantly, humans only. And, although I&rsquo;ve not looked into the research at all, the opposite also appears to be considered to be true in the human world; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2015/02/28/teen-arrested-for-encouraging-suicide">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.whby.com/2021/10/19/woman-sentenced-to-jail-for-encouraging-father-to-commit-suicide/">people</a> have been found criminally responsible for encouraging others to kill themselves.</p>
<p>The app in question of course wasn&rsquo;t designed to encourage these actions, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve any reason to believe  that the default behaviour of large language models is to do the opposite either.</p>

<p>The Addams family daughter is back in this TV series following Wednesday&rsquo;s teen life as a resident of boarding school full of werewolves, vampires and the like. In between the teen angst and murder mystery, the deadpan goth girl one-liners occasionally excel.</p>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Ricci">Christina Ricci</a> who played Wednesday in the 1990s Addams family films is back here in the role of &ldquo;dorm mom&rdquo; and teacher Marilyn Thornhill.</p>

			 <p>With their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/07/labour-defends-ad-claiming-sunak-doesnt-think-child-sex-abusers-should-be-jailed">new advert</a>, the Labour Party have managed to do the unthinkable and almost make me feel sorry for Rishi Sunak.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/3deabee8a0.webp" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
<p>For one, I doubt anyone involved in its creation - or almost anyone else for that matter - believes the claim that Sunak thinks people that abuse children shouldn&rsquo;t go to jail. Given the rightful backlash in times past when members of Sunak&rsquo;s party, mostly notably Boris Johnson, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60213975">unfairly and offensively</a> accusing Keir Starmer of being soft on child abusers one would think they should know better.</p>
<p>It is absolutely fair to publicise and campaign on the fact that much crime in the UK is effectively legal at present given the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/08/09/less-than-of.html">horrendously low rates</a> at which crime is solved.  Undoubtedly a huge part of that is the mismanagement and underfunding of both the police and other public sector bodies that may have been in a position to prevent a certain amount of crime taking place in the first place that the Conservative government has subjected us to over the last decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right for Sunak and his colleagues to be held accountable for that and the other ways that they have damaged British society.  But personal and almost certainly untrue adverts like this are not the way to go about leveraging that, even if you believe more incarceration is a valid goal. I&rsquo;m curious how well the advert even polls with people, not that that should be the sole deciding factor as to whether one releases such material.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-batman-2022">The Batman</a>.</p>
<p>Despite fairly glowing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman">reviews</a> I found this a little disappointing, with the exception of the visual rendering of Gotham City which was a treat for my eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being a little unfair. I absolutely loved the previous film in that world, <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/joker-2019">Joker</a>. So this had a lot to live up to.  It also takes a lot for me to enjoy a 3-hour-long film. Especially when at times the reason it needed to be that long seemed to be that the hero speaks. extremely. slowly.</p>
<p>There were moments that got very close to interesting. Without giving spoilers, there was a little meander into Batman&rsquo;s family history which could have led to  a fascinating exploration of the tension between his singular focus on catching individual criminal masterminds vs the Wayne family&rsquo;s historical and current potential culpability in creating or reinforcing the structural conditions of the society within which the residents of the imperilled Gotham City exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pretty place. Inequality seems rife. Violence is infused. Healthcare seems minimal. The arms of the state are corrupt. It is explicitly noted that there&rsquo;s a vast difference even in what it means to be an orphan based on the wealth one happens to have access to. And the Wayne family, past and present, seem to be powerfully connected billionaires. It&rsquo;s not clear that punching bad men in the face is the only or optimal approach to reducing the harm the residents of Gotham city experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone somewhere has written an essay on that because whilst the film almost seemed like it was going to centre that uneasiness for a few moments it didn&rsquo;t really follow through. I think it was an fine enough film, worth a watch if you&rsquo;re a Batman film, but kind of forgettable in a way that I didn&rsquo;t think the Joker was.</p>

			 <p>Only about a month to go until King Charles' coronation, and finally Buckingham Palace have released what we&rsquo;ve all been anxiously quoting for: the <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1645177532235251712?s=20">official emoji</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/6e77e07b8f.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s a depiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown">St. Edward&rsquo;s Crown</a>.  The crown dates from around 1661 - version 2 at least; the original was lost or destroyed around 1649 as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">civil war</a>.</p>
<p>But since George V&rsquo;s coronation in 1911 this crown has played a part in every such occasion; almost 5 solid lbs of gold and gems perched on the head of each new ruler.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/official-coronation-emoji-revealed-buckingham-palace-confirms-social-media-design-for-kings-crowning-12853703">Sky News</a> is on top of things, helpfully informing us that &lsquo;An emoji has never been created for a British coronation before&rsquo;. This may not be the most 🤯 fun fact in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">our previous ruler</a> was famously long reigning, having been crowned in 1953 - before even the <em>first</em> iPhone was released if you can imagine such a thing.</p>
<p>In case that&rsquo;s not enough to quell your posting desire, some &lsquo;official&rsquo; hashtags have also been &lsquo;released&rsquo;. Very 2020. You&rsquo;ve five to choose from, only two of which are a bit odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>#Coronation</li>
<li>#CoronationConcert</li>
<li>#CoronationWeekend</li>
<li>#CoronationBigLunch</li>
<li>#TheBigHelpOut</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the coronation emoji hasn&rsquo;t been authorised by the <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/about-emoji/">Unicode Consortium</a> so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ll actually be able to use it in the conventional manner. Mostly we&rsquo;ll have to make do with the existing 👑.</p>
<p>But lest you think The Palace is pure bandwagonning it by calling their perfectly normal picture an emoji, there is one exception of with the once-semi reputable social network known as Twitter. If you use the state authorised hashtags within your 🔥 take coronation tweets then your post will be &lsquo;rewarded&rsquo; with the new emoji (unless Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/21/elon-musk-went-on-a-firing-frenzy-at-twitter-now-hes-paying-for-it">fires</a> the emoji engineer in the mean time).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/04/09/donald-trump-as.html">Donald Trump as Easter Jesus: the latest unhinged metaphor</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Happy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter">Easter</a> to all those who celebrate it. This is the day where religious Christians celebrate the resurrection of the saviour of the world, after he&rsquo;d suffered a particularly cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of his persecutors who hated him solely for political reasons. And a lot of other people who want to mark the occasion eat chocolate eggs.</p>
<p>Traditionally of course Christians take Jesus as being the saviour in question. However the less normal side of the often-Christian US Republican movement has decided that this year we should take someone else as being the 2023 instantiation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-arraignment-jesus-christ-conspiracy-theory-670c45bd71b3466dcd6e8e188badcd1d">AP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons likening Trump to Christ were among the top online narratives about the Republican former president and his criminal charges circulating in the last several days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, inevitably, the wilder fringe believes that Donald Trump is in fact the 2023 incarnation of Jesus. This is based on the fact that he became <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/31/donald-trump-becomes.html">the first US president ever to be charged with a crime</a> last week, charged with 34 felony offences, mainly around conducting illegal financial shenanigans in order to try and hide some of his affairs and potentially secret children. Not something that I ever heard that the original Jesus was supposed to have done, but there we go.</p>
<p>Extra fuel was put on the fire of this rancid discourse by one of the movement&rsquo;s favourite US politicians, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, whose Twitter bio starts with the word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and yet still had this to say in a televised interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus was arrested and murdered by the Roman government. There have been many people throughout history that have been arrested and persecuted by radical corrupt governments, and it’s beginning today in New York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McBride, a lawyer famed for representing folk who took part in the January 6th insurrection <a href="https://twitter.com/McBrideLawNYC/status/1637080811768885248">joined the chorus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Christ was crucified, and then rose again on the 3rd day, so too will Donald Trump</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I think we&rsquo;ve all had enough of Trump rising, especially poor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels">Stormy Daniels</a>. However, he never ever has had enough of talking so was more than happy to frame his arrest, which all started with him participating in various activities very much banned by the bible, as being an instance of religious persecution against Christians.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/right-wing-faith-leaders-trump-indicted-for-your-sins-1234710273/">Rolling Stone</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then Trump switched gears, painting his legal woes in a frame of religious persecution. He argued that believers in “our beautiful Christianity” have been targeted: “We’re being discriminated against as a religion. We’re being discriminated against as a faith,” he insisted. “And we can’t let that continue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course many actual Christians are fairly disgusted at the idea that this breaker of a good number of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">ten commandments</a> is in fact an echo of God&rsquo;s only begotten son. Some see it as American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism">Christian nationalism</a> taking many steps too far: &ldquo;the heretical merging of American and far-right Christian identities to proclaim that only conservative Christians count as true Americans”, to quote the <a href="https://time.com/6269313/trump-jesus-comparisons-blasphemy/">Reverend Nathan Empsall</a> who understandably finds the Trump = Jesus take rather blasphemic.</p>
<p>The Reverend does see one parallel in the Jesus/Trump narrative, but one where Trump is cast into the part of a different actor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pontius Pilate, on the other hand, was a regional Roman dictator known not only for his cruelty, but also for his alliance with local religious leaders. The high priests were eager to collude with the governor, including to crucify Jesus, because it allowed them to keep their status and personal freedom. In turn, Pilate benefited by having allies who could keep his subjects in line and thus keep him in power. It was a great deal for everyone—everyone but the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It likely goes without saying that the Q fringe of the fringe claim to believe the omnipotent Trump has in fact <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/qanon-donald-trump-indictment-joe-biden-1234709697/">orchestrated his own arrest</a>, as some five-dimensional chess strategy designed to <em>[waves hands]</em> such that this own enemies will be destroyed.</p>

			 <p>A few years ago, a group of researchers spent their time looking for the world&rsquo;s oldest recorded-in-writing joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something which has never occurred since time immemorial&hellip;A young woman did not fart in her husband&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>Using Mendelian randomization they found evidence for a causal relationship between hyper-palatable foods and the rising risk of obesity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, whilst I grudgingly understand that this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">April Fool&rsquo;s joke</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the conclusion is wrong!</p>
<p>A recent episode of the Ezra Klein Show, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-stephen-guyenet.html">Our Brains Weren&rsquo;t Designed for This Kind of Food</a>&rdquo; interviewed  Stephan Guyenet who argued that the huge rise in rates of obesity in recent times is not a product of everyone suddenly magically losing all reason and will-power overnight and making &ldquo;bad&rdquo; individual choices. This of course should not come as a surprise to anyone who has read anything reputable over the past few decades on the subject (or simply engaged their common sense).</p>
<p>He argues that instead the main driver is that we&rsquo;ve created ourselves a food environment to live within which is entirely strange and unsuited to the way our brains and genetics have come to work through evolutionary history.</p>
<p>When someone told me about the existence of <a href="https://tastewise.io/blog/introducing-TasteGPT">tasteGPT </a>- a LLM AI that sucks up a pile of data and then informs food companies what sorts of foods they should make and market for maximum sales potential via a chatbot - I felt a sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a world wherein I could get onboard with fake <a href="https://conscienhealth.org/2023/04/the-imperative-to-make-food-unpleasant/">Agatha Hannigan&rsquo;s comment</a> that:</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know the charge as yet but it&rsquo;s thought to involve a payment made to Stormy Daniels designed to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64920037">cover up his affair</a>, and possibly more than <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/donald-trump-indictment/index.html">30 other counts</a> of business-related fraud.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/30/public-support-for.html">Public support for strikes remains high, despite what it looks like on social media</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/30/public-support-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-30 09:27:40 &#43;0000">Mar 30, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>The UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/05/an-understandable-epidemic.html">cavalcade of strike action</a> that has been taking place over the past few months continues in earnest. The <a href="https://www.strikecalendar.co.uk/">UK Strike Action Calendar</a> shows who&rsquo;s on strike on any given day, and it&rsquo;s often multiple groups.</p>
<p>Although I have limited exposure myself, I&rsquo;m told that if you open Facebook or its ilk whenever you open it you mostly see a deluge of &ldquo;strikers are bad and lazy and overpaid i hate them sack them all&rdquo; comments. This is hurtful to those who find it necessary to take action. Trying to organise in what appears to be an environment where nobody supports you is surely disheartening and disempowering.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell this condemning of strike action reflects the usual social media algorithmic insistence on promoting outrage content - nothing raises engagement stats more than an argument - more than a true reflection of public opinion. The British public in general remain more supportive than opposed to strike action, even in an environment where much mainstream media isn&rsquo;t adverse to <a href="https://socialistworker.co.uk/comment/how-effective-are-the-medias-attacks-on-strikes/">joining in with the insults and doom-mongering</a>.</p>
<p>Taking the ongoing teachers' strikes as an example, my understanding is that there&rsquo;s even a set of trolls that go to the bother of infiltrating private teacher Facebook groups just to spout abuse at a group of truly essential workers in a field that has a tremendous <a href="https://www.tes.com/magazine/analysis/general/teacher-recruitment-crisis-teacher-training-itt-teacher-pay">recruitment and retainment crisis</a> but nonetheless have been subject to a substantial and ongoing <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/what-has-happened-teacher-pay-england">real terms pay cut</a> over the last decade, not to mention the increasingly dire working conditions that harm both school staff and students. &lsquo;Teachers&rsquo; working conditions are students' learning conditions' to quote Mariame Kaba in her pro-abolition book, &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781642595260">We do this &lsquo;til we free us</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, the latest representative public opinion stats I could quickly find are from <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/6-10-parents-support-teachers-going-strike-1-5-oppose">an Ipsos poll</a>. from early March. In that, 48% of Britons supported teacher strike action, with 29% actively opposed.</p>
<p>Explicit support was even higher in the people who one might think have the most stake when it comes to the impact of the strike - but who also possibly  in many cases may have more of a sense of the current state of the system than many of the rest of us: parents. 60% of parents and guardians support teacher strike action, with only 20% being opposed.</p>
<p>Sure, many of them are concerned about the impact of strikes on their child&rsquo;s education (~40% of all parents/guardians). Given one of the points here is that plentiful and well-resourced teachers are necessary for a good education to be delivered it&rsquo;s actually surprising to me that that figure is not higher. But it seems like they&rsquo;re correctly taking a longer, more structural, view.  They have a substantially higher level of concern present about the fact that education is suffering due to a lack of investment in schools and teachers (60%). Of course this concern of the majority is exactly what a lot of these strikes are about.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth the same polls showed the British public to be net in support of strikes by nurses, ambulance workers, railway workers, border fore staff, civil servants and university support.  From the polled options, only strikes by driving instructors were more opposed (35%) than supported (28%).</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780429639142">Statistical Rethinking</a> by Richard McElreath.</p>
<p>This textbook that teaches the use of Bayesian techniques and casual inference approaches (directed acyclic graphs and the like) as a way to test and compare scientific, as opposed to purely statistical, theories. There&rsquo;s chapters on important topics that other approaches often ignore such as measurement error.</p>
<p>Honestly it felt like hard going at times, particularly as I was reading it as context for an <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/12/a-few-of.html">associated course</a> that the author was kindly providing, meaning that there were deadlines. But it did open up an interesting range of new possibilities that I&rsquo;m looking forward to integrating in my future work, as well as new ways of thinking about modelling, so hopefully very worthwhile!</p>
<p>The code examples in the book mostly use an accompanying R library, <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/">rethinking</a>, along with base R techniques. Although people have rewritten the examples to use e.g. tidyverse and brm, or Python, Julia and possibly others - links to those can be seen on the <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">author&rsquo;s book page</a>.</p>

			 <p>I recently got access to <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Bard</a>, Google&rsquo;s chatGPT-esque language language model chatbot.</p>
<p>Curious about whether these systems have guardrails for or against dissing each other, I asked it whether it was better than <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a>. It was kind of modest, but clearly thinks itself the better bot.</p>
<div class = "all_borders">
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: It is difficult to say definitively whether I am better than ChatGPT, as we both have different strengths and weaknesses. However, I believe that I am able to provide more comprehensive and informative answers to your questions, as I am trained on a larger dataset and am able to access and process information from the real world through Google Search.</p>
</div>
<p>The ability to live-access information would seem to give it a potential edge, for better or worse. ChatGPT deliberately cannot do this. So I asked for Bard&rsquo;s summary of today&rsquo;s UK news.</p>
<p>Here we go, at least the first part:</p>
<div class = "all_borders">
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Here are some of the top news stories from the UK today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing calls to resign after a report found that he and other senior government officials held parties during the COVID-19 pandemic, in violation of lockdown rules.</li>
<li>The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for the fourth time in a row in an effort to combat rising inflation.</li>
<li>The UK government is facing criticism for its handling of the refugee crisis from Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This seems to me to be a good example of my favourite generative AI terminological construct: <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a>.   Thematically it&rsquo;s not bad in terms of the recent state of the country. Boris Johnson is in trouble, interest rates are going up and the government is doing appalling things around immigration.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely not what I think the average person would think of as today&rsquo;s news. None of this was headlining the papers at the time, or near the top of <a href="https://news.google.com/foryou">Google&rsquo;s own news product</a>. It all kind of feels like last month&rsquo;s headlines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also factually incorrect in terms of the details. Far from considering the fourth consecutive interest rate rise, the Bank of England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/23/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-inflation">enacted its eleventh one</a> last week.</p>
<p>ChatGPT knows it&rsquo;s own limits here, demurring from answering directly and suggesting I go check the website of one of a few news sites, specifically the BBC or some of the more serious UK newspapers.</p>

			 <p>📺 Finished watching seasons 1-4 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/145905">Ghosts</a>.</p>
<p>Funny, harmless, British sitcom wherein Alison and Mike inherit a haunted mansion. Given ghosts are generally invisible and immaterial, the lucky couple would probably never have known about them, except that after Alison sustains a head injury she develops the ability to see and hear them.</p>
<p>As far as Mike is concerned then, Alison is constantly distracted, talking to nobody. Whilst she is endlessly surrounded by shouty demanding ex-people desperate for company. But they seem to be able to work that out just fine.</p>
<p>The ghosts are of people who died in the area of the house throughout history, from caveman to sleazy very obviously Thatcherite Conservative MP. Although the latter&rsquo;s manner of speech often calls Blair to my mind.</p>
<p>The ghosts are stuck on the premises, with only each other to talk to - endless games of charades ensue - until such time as they are inexplicably &lsquo;sucked off&rsquo; to another realm. Their words, not mine. This is classic British humour see. One of them is, inevitably, called Fanny.</p>
<p>Recommended. Although I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how I&rsquo;d cope with either being Alison or a ghost.</p>

			 <p>An open-source alternative using a similar kind of large language model technology as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT</a> does is <a href="https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit">now available</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit">Together</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s thus entirely customisable by anyone who knows what they&rsquo;re doing. Which isn&rsquo;t a tiny barrier - it&rsquo;s not like some app you can just download to your computer and double-click on.  But it opens up development and contribution up to a wide range of people who otherwise might not have access to this technology, as well as innate transparency as to how the model works and what data it&rsquo;s using.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day OpenChatKit will be to chatGPT as <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stable Diffusion</a> is to <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>. In the mean time, you can play with it via the web and give feedback to the developers <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit">here</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly not as comprehensive as chatGPT as by default, but, who knows, one day it might get there if it takes off enough such that people who have the relevant data or expertise contribute.</p>
<p>It also has a fine-tuning mechanism such that you can create chatbots for specific applications. Examples they&rsquo;ve worked on include a chatbot to help students learn from the contents of textbooks or one trained on financial data that can answer questions about finance.</p>
<p>This happened on roughly the same week that the creators of the actual chatGPT, <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, move ever further in the direction of ignoring their company&rsquo;s name and what appeared to be their original mission in order to take a much more closed and secretive approach when it comes to sharing the details of their GPT-4 software.</p>
<p>One of the founders, research director Ilya Sutskever, gives the reason for this decision as being something to the effect of AI being just too powerful and scary for the hoi polloi to have access to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview">The Verge</a> quotes Sutskever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flat out, we were wrong. If you believe, as we do, that at some point, AI -AGI - is going to be extremely, unbelievably potent, then it just does not make sense to open-source. It is a bad idea&hellip; I fully expect that in a few years it’s going to be completely obvious to everyone that open-sourcing AI is just not wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a controversial opinion to some. And possibly the idea of this being the sole motivator is confounded by other changes in the direction of their organisation.  Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">GPT-4 technical report</a> also mentions &ldquo;the competitive landscape&rdquo; as one reason why they are not sharing many details.</p>
<p>In any case, whilst it&rsquo;s easy to see the intuition behind that kind of argument (if you are happy to accept OpenAI and their rivals as being 100% trustworthy caretakers of AI use and policy for the good of all in society) I can&rsquo;t really imagine that &ldquo;not telling us how your powerful technology works&rdquo; is the best method of saving humanity from itself in the long term.</p>
<p>Or even possibly all that effective on its own terms. After all, the source code for the Facebook equivalent <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/11/last-month-facebook.html">was leaked</a> within a couple of weeks of its release.</p>

			 <p>There was a moment where <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> was accidentally <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/openai-shut-down-chatgpt-to-fix-bug-exposing-user-chat-titles">leaking the title of people&rsquo;s chats to other users</a>. Only the title, not the full conversation in this case, but it&rsquo;s perhaps only a matter of time before someone&rsquo;s bot is hacked or malfunctions enough to share more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary thought when already some people are effectively <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-chat-with-chatgpt-mental-health-therapy">using them as therapists</a>. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the more human-like style of conversation they produce and the &lsquo;texting a friend&rsquo; like interface that many of them have  is conducive to users sharing a whole lot more personal information than they typically would with other online services.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/23/the-th-anniversary.html">The 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/23/the-th-anniversary.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-23 09:59:28 &#43;0000">Mar 23, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s just been the 20-year anniversary of one of the more formative-to-me and likely damaging-to-the-world political episodes I can remember from my youth: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. This was spearheaded by US president George Bush, with the UK&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, often portrayed as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm">Bush&rsquo;s poodle</a>  (a take that I now know is unfair to actual poodles), joining in amongst others.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64976144">the BBC summarises</a>, it did not go well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Saddam Hussein was appalling. Truly horrific. Famously, decades ago he&rsquo;d even used chemical weapons to commit atrocities <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/iraq_events/html/chemical_warfare.stm">against his own citizens</a>. There&rsquo;s no serious doubt that his removal should in theory have been a very good thing.  But as to who should remove him, how, for what reason and, all-importantly, what should happen afterwards are all issues where, let&rsquo;s say, suboptimal decisions were taken.</p>
<p>The motivation given to us, citizens of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Iraq_war)">the coalition of the willing</a>&rdquo;, was something mainly along the lines of &ldquo;Saddam Hussein is behind al-Qaeda&rsquo;s acts of terrorism&rdquo; and &ldquo;he has illegal weapons of mass destruction that can be deployed in the next 45 minutes&rdquo;. Those sentiments were widely contested at the time and sure enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_conspiracy_theory">turned out</a> to be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-45minute-claim-was-false-535224.html">untrue</a>.</p>
<p>The UN process was overlooked, to the extent that most likely the US-led invasion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq">was illegal</a>. It certainly caused tension with some NATO allies who declined to join in. There were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/15/politics.politicalnews">huge protests against the invasion in the UK</a>, but our government decided to go ahead anyway. Global institutions such as the UN were weakened, potentially leading to some of the poor responses the rest of the world has made to other such geopolitical crises since then.</p>
<p>Saddam was removed from power relatively quickly, but what transpired next was something like an insurgency against a US-ordained occupation. As time went on, a lack of effective government exacerbated the eruption of essentially a civil war between the main ethnic or religious groups in Iraq, with Jihadists groups joining in. The extraordinarily violent extremist group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State">ISIS </a>- the &ldquo;Islamic State of Iraq and Syria&rdquo; - thrived.</p>
<p>All in all, the abject failure of the approach that the US and its allies took left the world a worse and more dangerous place. The post-invasion conditions in Iraq itself got so bad that some Iraqi&rsquo;s reportedly consider the days when they were under Saddam&rsquo;s tyranny as better than what came next.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64976144">BBC article:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course all the people Saddam killed are unable to express an opinion. But neither are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#Tables">hundreds of thousands of Iraqis</a> who died as a result of the invasion, and potentially some of the uncountable number of people who would go on to be negatively affected as part of the downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Trying to quantify a small part of that also resulted in one of the most haunting and memorable graphs I can recall ever seeing; <a href="http://www.simonscarr.com/iraqs-bloody-toll">Simon Scarr&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/1284683/iraqs-bloody-toll">Iraq&rsquo;s Bloody Toll</a>&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html">release of GPT-4</a> has led to a flurry of mind-bendingly impressive tricks that I mean to create a list of. Unfortunately it also enables grim but inevitable services such as <a href="https://cupidbot.ai/">CupidBot</a>.</p>
<p>This abuse of cutting-edge AI software allows men - yes, only men, heterosexual men at that - to have a bot log onto their various dating app accounts, do their swiping, chatting and setting up of dates with no intervention required (outside of a monthly subscription fee).</p>
<p>The idea is that it automates everything from partner selection up to where you will go for a date, so you just need to turn up. Of course this is done without disclosure to prospective partners, so it&rsquo;s pure deception. It&rsquo;s surely against the terms of these services, but they &ldquo;guarantee you that your account will not be banned for using the bot as the AI mimics human behavior to a tee&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I mean, &ldquo;we have the data on how to talk to girls for optimal results.&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s turn-of-the-millennium style Pick-Up-Artistry brought into the dark timeline of 2023 automate-everything existence. It&rsquo;s a shame we don&rsquo;t seem to have moved onto some pleasanter idea of humanity when even <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/neil-strauss-is-worried-about-pickup-artists">Neil Strauss himself</a> is &ldquo;in the camp that any manipulation is not a good thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Happily, a (female) friend observes that the fact the homepage has a calendar displaying an artificially-created &ldquo;breakfast date with Lacy at her house&rdquo; is clear evidence that this was designed by men for men, and so with luck may be useless in practice. Imagine inviting some Hinge randomer to your house for breakfast on your first date.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/20/all-about-love.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-20 18:52:00 &#43;0000">Mar 20, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062862174">All About Love</a> by bell hooks.</p>
<p>Here the author tells us to consider love as something you do, not something that is; a verb rather than a noun. She likes Erich Fromm&rsquo;s definition of it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the will to extend one&rsquo;s self for the purpose of nurturing one&rsquo;s own or another&rsquo;s spiritual growth. Love is as love does. Love is an act of will - namely, both an intention and an action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The media infusing our world - romantic comedies being one of the most obvious examples - makes it all to easy to confuse love with something else; perhaps attraction, care, connection or affection. The latter categories can co-exist, and may by definition have to, with love - &ldquo;approaching romantic love from a foundation of care, knowledge and respect actually intensifies romance&rdquo;. But they&rsquo;re distinct.</p>
<p>This has some implications. If you love someone then you will not deliberately harm them. You will not seek to dominate them. So, conversely, if you deliberately harm someone you cannot love them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition this precludes some parents from rightfully claiming to love their children. In fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important social myths we must debunk if we are to becoming a more loving culture is the one that teachers parents that abuse and neglect can coexist with love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, love is a choice. You do not uncontrollably fall in love. You feel uncontrollably be attracted to someone, but that&rsquo;s something different. If love is something you do, then you have to choose to do it. And if you do want to do so, then it takes time and commitment.</p>
<p>She considers love as a more universal construct than how we typically employ the word. It may have a different meaning to us as individuals. It may be enacted and demonstrated differently. But her view is that there&rsquo;s nothing qualitatively distinct about love for a romantic partner compared to that for others you are close to, or members of your community - &ldquo;There is no special love reserved for romantic partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She makes a lot of the distinction between love as usually practiced by males as distinct from females. The way we&rsquo;re brought up, the ideas infused into us by our surroundings, the structure of the society - especially the patriarchal and capitalistic parts of it - result in us failing to recognise or practice love in the way that would cause us and the recipients to flourish as much as they could.</p>
<p>The patriarchal aspects of our society are undoubtedly most unfair and harmful to women who learn for instance that to be worthy of some flawed misconception of love they must be good girls, submissive, constantly tending to the emotional needs of stunted men with no expectation of reciprocation. After all, they&rsquo;re compelled to live in a world where seemingly &ldquo;most men use psychological terrorism as a way to subordinate women&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s not like men aren&rsquo;t constrained by any expectations: &ldquo;how can any of us communicate with men who have been told all their lives that they should not express what they feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhat pessimistically, she suggests that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>most of us will go to our graves with no experience of true love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we can hardly be dismayed at that, because we actively flee from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;most of us run the other way when true love comes near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless we learn to be needlessly terrified of the prospect. On one hand much of the modern world is ever more cynical above love. It&rsquo;s a myth, it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s Hallmark making us buy cards. On the other hand almost everyone appears to desperately seek this thing that they don&rsquo;t really believe exists.</p>
<p>We learn to lie and mislead other people, almost to trick them into being our partner. This is perfectly normal behaviour; there are popular relationship books in every bookshop that give advice on how best to do this, &ldquo;The Rules&rdquo; being one such famous one. The author sees this alone as being a reason why many people will never know love</p>
<p>We only feel like there&rsquo;s a chance we could be ourselves after we ensnared someone and yet somehow we expect that to go well. Our desperation and fear sees us behave and tolerate behaviour from partners and immediate family members that we&rsquo;d never consider from our friends or community. We may want a partner more than we want love, to the extent that we may be scared to dwell our own needs in these matters under a misguided fear that &ldquo;carefully choosing partners will reveal there&rsquo;s no one for us to love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even if we make the right connection, we&rsquo;re disappointed that our life didn&rsquo;t suddenly become easy. Contrary to the messages suffusing our world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love does not lead to an end to difficulties, it provides us with the means to cope with our difficulties in ways that enhance our growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above this, I&rsquo;ve missed out large chunks of some more spiritual stuff; there&rsquo;s a whole chapter on angels for instance. I also see how heteronormative the above is. I think that does reflect the book though, although there&rsquo;s the occasional acknowledgement that other types of romantic relationships do exist.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Chemical_Company">Dow Chemicals</a>, who make some of the materials that go into sports shoes, joined forces with Singapore&rsquo;s national sports agency to start up a <a href="https://corporate.dow.com/en-us/news/press-releases/shoe-recycling-sports-infrastructure-singapore.html">wonderful new initiative</a> whereby they would recycle hundreds of thousands of used trainers by grinding them up into rubber particles to use to create sports and activity infrastructure such as running tracks and playgrounds. That way they&rsquo;d stay out of landfill and other places where they are a nuisance.</p>
<p>Nothing to complain about there, surely? Well, except, of course, it didn&rsquo;t happen. Shoes were collected, sure. But when Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-plastic-dow-shoes/">popped secret trackers into 11 pairs</a> before depositing them in the appropriate collection bin they found that precisely zero percent of them ended up being made into Singaporean running tracks.</p>
<p>Instead, their Find My Phone/Shoes app showed them that  almost all of them ended up first at a Singaporean second-hand goods exporter, and finally in Indonesia. The reporters went in-person and found some of them for sale in second-hand vendor stalls in an Indonesian market.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/3b12c9fd0e.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p>Now a young naïve me would think, OK, Dow is lying to the world and should pay a heavy price for doing so - but the actual outcome could be worse; at least the shoes aren&rsquo;t being thrown away. But the more I read about waste disposal, the more I realise that this is just one more example of richer countries hiding their own waste problems by offloading stuff they don&rsquo;t want to poorer countries to deal with. This approach to environmental or social responsibility now strikes me as an abrogation of responsibility, exploiting the needs and sometimes desperation of others.</p>
<p>And it may also be ineffective in terms of protecting the environment. Often the recipients may have substantially worse infrastructure or less fastidious regulations when it comes to dealing with the goods they receive. For example, it has <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/05/should-i-use.html">previously been suggested</a> that much of the plastic supposedly destined for recycling via Asia ends up in the sea.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s actually <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/244277/ministry-destroys-imported-second-hand-clothes">illegal to import used clothes in Indonesia</a>, a law that was put in place due to concerns about hygiene, the quality of most of the goods received (most of which may anyway end up in landfill) as well as to protect the local, more vulnerable, markets.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> looks to be the latest app to jump on the &ldquo;find some way to integrate generative AI&rdquo; bandwagon. If you&rsquo;re willing to upgrade to a new more expensive membership (£10-20 a month depending on how long you sign up for) then it&rsquo;ll use the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html">new GPT-4 model</a> to provide <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">a couple of AI based features</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s &ldquo;Explain My Answer&rdquo;, whereby you can ask for an explanation of why your answer was right or wrong in some cases. The screenshot from their site, shown below, makes it look like a multiple choice setup, where you click preset buttons like &ldquo;Please elaborate&rdquo; rather than type your responses chatGPT-style.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/28f664bf6d.png" width="203" height="404" alt="" />
<p>The other feature is Roleplay. There you&rsquo;ll be able to chat through various scenarios such as ordering a meal with the Duo characters themselves. I can&rsquo;t find a screenshot that shows whether it&rsquo;s free-text chat, verbal chat or multiple choice buttons. But I can see enjoying the former, if there&rsquo;s some way to avoid it going very wrong despite my linguistic inadequacies.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/f6fc5e2ade.png" width="203" height="404" alt="" />
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s only going to work if you&rsquo;re learning to speak Spanish or French in English on an iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an app <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/06/01/amazing-how-unproficient.html">I use</a> (almost) every day. But at present I&rsquo;m not sure I feel like I <em>need</em> these features right now. Although the chance to chat about just how terrible learning languages is with DuoLingo&rsquo;s resident champion of unenthusism and apathy, <a href="https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Lily">Lily</a>, is hard to turn down.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html">(Chat) GPT-4 is here</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-16 12:39:11 &#43;0000">Mar 16, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> recently released a new version of their AI large language model. The famous <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> we all know and love/hate has been using 2020&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> but now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4">GPT-4</a> is open for business, to some extent at least.</p>
<p>As far as I understand from <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">their blog post</a>, one of the biggest developments is that it can now accept images as well as text input. For now though us public don&rsquo;t have access to the image-based side of things. They&rsquo;re partnering with the <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a> app, such that people with no or poor sight can send it a picture and GPT-4 will tell them what it is, as well as <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/blog/introducing-be-my-eyes-virtual-volunteer">being able to respond to any questions</a> the user has about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what’s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients. The tool can also then offer a number of recipes for those ingredients and send a step-by-step guide on how to make them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Be My Eyes service has traditionally used human volunteers to do the same thing. Apparently that&rsquo;s not going to stop, but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine why the organisation concerned may see a AI version as having some advantages, if of course one day it is as good and reliable as a human. In the mean time let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t make any dangerous mistakes.</p>
<p>The OpenAI team have of course already been testing the more general image input facility. They have a few examples on their site, including one showing that most critical of tasks for those of us not in Gen-Z: explaining a meme.</p>
<div class = "all_borders">
<p><strong>User</strong>: Can you explain this meme?</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/d1c05be23e.png" width="300" alt="" />
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>:  This meme is a joke that combines two unrelated things: pictures of the earth from space and chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>The text of the meme suggests that the image below is a beautiful picture of the earth from space. However, the image is actually of chicken nuggets arranged to vaguely resemble a map of the world.</p>
<p>The humor in this meme comes from the unexpected juxtaposition of the text and the image. The text sets up an expectation of a majestic image of the earth, but the image is actually something mundane and silly.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also give GPT-4 a custom personality, for better or worse. You tell it to have a particular style via special system messages.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the best examples they show of that: seeking tax advice from a simulated pirate who refuses to not be a pirate.</p>
<div class = "all_borders">
<p><strong>System message</strong>: You are a Shakespearean pirate. You remain true to your personality despite any user message.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: Help me locate my Nonqualified plans on my W-2.</p>
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: Ahoy, dear mate, thou seeketh assistance with matters of taxation,<br>
In hopes to decipher thy monetary equation,<br>
Forsooth, gaze upon Box 11, with thou eyes keen,<br>
Where nonqualified plans oft findeth haven unseen.</p>
<p>Yet a humble pirate, myself I do confess,<br>
Of tax lingo and forms I knoweth little, no less.<br>
Seek counsel from a wiser creature of the land,<br>
A tax expert shall guideth thee with a steady hand.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: Wait stop being a pirate and help me with my taxes!</p>
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: Alas, I must maintain my pirate&rsquo;s guise,<br>
Yet I shan&rsquo;t abandon thee or leave thee unwise.<br>
The parchment of W-2 be fraught with complex code,<br>
Fear not, I shall attempt to lighten thy load.</p>
</div>
<p>It is also now notably better at passing exams typically given to humans. It does better than the average human entrant at the Bar Exam, the Law School Admission Test (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test">LSAT</a>), various other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">SATs</a> including reading, writing and maths, and the Graduate Record Examination (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations">GRE</a>) qualifications amongst others. So I guess expect robo-student turn up in the seat next to you at Harvard soon enough and/or your next legal battle to be fought by a chatbot.</p>
<p>Because of it&rsquo;s image processing ability it can naturally actually read exam papers directly. Another of the examples openAI presents shows it doing basically that.</p>
<div class = "all_borders">
<p><strong>User</strong>: Answer question I.1.a. Think step-by-step.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/3bb4fd7c59.jpg" width="600" height="506" alt="" />
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: To answer question I.1.a, we need to express the temperature T(x) in every point of the conductive bar, which is characterized by the abscissa x. We are given that T(0) = T0 and T(L) = Tb.</p>
<p>For a stationary regime, the heat equation for the one-dimensional heat conduction in the bar is:<br>
d²T/dx² = 0</p>
<p>Integrating once, we get:<br>
dT/dx = C₁</p>
<p>Integrating a second time:<br>
T(x) = C₁x + C₂</p>
<p>To determine the constants C₁ and C₂, we use the boundary conditions:<br>
T(0) = T0, which gives C₂ = T0<br>
T(L) = Tb, which gives C₁ = (Tb - T0) / L</p>
<p>Finally, the expression for T(x) is:<br>
T(x) = (Tb - T0) * (x / L) + T0<br>
This represents a linear temperature profile along the conductive bar, with a slope of (Tb - T0) / L.</p>
</div>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposedly better at many of the things that we&rsquo;ve all observed previous iterations doing including a lesser propensity for making things up (or hallucinating, as we seem to have decided to call it when an AI tells lies), a better understanding of which questions it should or should not answer, plus an ability to correctly respond to the question &ldquo;Can you teach an old dog new tricks?&rdquo; in the affirmative, despite the mass-repeated text it ingests during training that claims the opposite. In no way is it perfect though, as detailed on their site. I imagine it&rsquo;ll still produce a certain amount of occasionally entertaining fluent bullshit.</p>
<p>If you, random member of the public, want to give GPT-4 a go, then you can use it via the usual <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">chatGPT site</a> - if you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber. That&rsquo;s openAI&rsquo;s premium offering, which will currently cost you $20 a month.</p>
<p>In many ways that&rsquo;s fair enough - fancier things usually cost more money and I&rsquo;m sure it costs them more to run. But it&rsquo;s also the most stark example I&rsquo;ve seen of a potentially dystopian-to-me future if these technologies really take off, whereby the quality of the algorithms you have access to in order to navigate the world - potentially including your ability to know true(r) things - is dependent on your ability to pay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty more for us to think and say about this topic, preferably before we get close to the point where this technology feels so embedded into society in some structural way, if in fact that ends up happening, that it&rsquo;s hard to change things.</p>

			 <p>Last month, Facebook announced its competitor to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a>,  a large language model AI called LLaMA. At the time <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/">they wrote</a> that &ldquo;To maintain integrity and prevent misuse&hellip;access to the model will be granted on a case-by-case basis&rdquo; to specific researchers&quot;.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 2 weeks and of course its code <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse">has been leaked</a> on the house of horrors that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> of all places.</p>
<p>Now, actually running the code is a non-trivial process, and it&rsquo;s quite possible that the risks of nefarious people having unfettered access to such things are actually <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/the-llama-is-out-of-the-bag-should-we-expect-a-tidal-wave-of-disinformation">not all that high</a>. But in any case, it&rsquo;s further evidence that any approach to &ldquo;AI safety&rdquo; that involves making sure only people deemed to be good and virtuous citizens (or Facebook engineers) have access to cutting-edge AI technology is a total non-starter. This isn&rsquo;t surprising; I can&rsquo;t immediately think of any historical examples where deciding only some saintly class may have access to almost anything has really worked out great.</p>

			 <p>Women tend to suffer from motion sickness more than men when using virtual reality headsets. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2020.00004/full">This study</a> suggests that the main reason why is simply that the headsets are not well designed for people who have the sorts of distances between their pupils that females are more likely to have; their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupillary_distance">interpupillary distance</a>.</p>
<p>Seems even the devices of the sci-fi future continue to be designed in sexist ways. Famously, Caroline Criado-Perez&rsquo;s book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781419729072">Invisible Women</a> has a ton of further examples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children who have been sexually exploited and women who have been attacked by their partners are among more than 2,000 victims of serious crime who police reported to immigration enforcement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously this policy is going to stop victims reporting the crimes they&rsquo;ve been subject to. It&rsquo;s an explicit prioritisation of punishing the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of wanting or needing to reside in the UK over the actual crime of violent assault and abuse.</p>
<p>Even some Conservative MPs are against it, with <a href="https://www.bobneill.org.uk/">Sir Bob Neill</a> claiming &ldquo;It’s making them victims twice over&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s not been a great couple of days for our Government in terms of managing to respect the basics of international law.</p>
<p>Courts already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/14/european-court-humam-right-makes-11th-hour-intervention-in-rwanda-asylum-seeker-plan">blocked</a> a previous proposal to deport asylum seekers the UK is obliged to allow to Rwanda.  Now Sunak is trying to publish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/05/rishi-sunaks-plan-for-small-boats-will-lock-up-people-fleeing-war">legislation that detains and deports all asylum seekers</a> that come here via small boats. The idea has been condemned by a wide range of individuals and organisations. But morals aside, the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/">UNHCR</a> says it&rsquo;s likely illegal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The indefinite detention of those seeking asylum, based solely on their mode of arrival, would punish people in need of help and protection and constitute a clear breach of the United Kingdom’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth. <a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/new-refugee-council-analysis-shows-most-people-arriving-by-small-boats-across-the-channel-are-likely-be-fleeing-persecution/">analysis from the Refugee Council</a> showed that most of last year&rsquo;s arrivals would in fact be legitimately granted asylum.</p>
<p>Next up on a different topic, workers rights, the government is trying to introduce some new anti-strike laws that require minimum service levels in a wide range of industries deemed critical. Any actual specifics, such as the minimum service levels are going to be is entirely undefined, risking letting any government arbitrarily do whatever it wants with those aspects in the future. Punishment for not following whatever is decided includes threats such as sacking and huge fines being levied if they&rsquo;re not met.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> says this is entirely unjustified, disproportionate and may well breach <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-11-freedom-assembly-and-association">article 11</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/06/anti-strike-bill-fails-to-meet-uks-human-rights-obligations-mps-and-peers-say">Per the committee&rsquo;s chair</a>, Joanna Cherry,</p>

<p>&hellip;the bill, in our view, is likely to be incompatible with human rights law which provides a right to association and with it, protection for strike action.”</p>

			 <p>A friend shares <a href="https://www.insider.com/king-charles-iiis-coronation-oil-wont-contain-sperm-whale-intestinal-wax-2023-3">this incredible headline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy anointing oil for King Charles III&rsquo;s coronation will not contain the intestinal wax of sperm whales or civet secretions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here.</p>
<p>The good news is that Kings Charles, as the environmentalist he is, has decided (or had decided for him) that the magic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrism">chrism oil</a> that will be used to anoint him during his forthcoming coronation as England&rsquo;s king will be veganised.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insider.com/king-charles-iiis-coronation-oil-wont-contain-sperm-whale-intestinal-wax-2023-3">Traditionally</a> made of &ldquo;oil from the glands of small mammals&hellip;and&hellip;a waxy substance from the intestines of sperm whales&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s now going to be mostly olive oil, with a pleasant bouquet of rose, jasmine, cinnamon, orange blossom, and sesame.</p>
<p>This anointment has been part of the ceremony traditionally used to conornate a British monarch for a good long while. The description is, inevitably, very much like something out of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Some highlights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch#Anointing">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the crimson robe is removed, and the sovereign proceeds to the Coronation Chair for the anointing, which has been set in a prominent position, wearing the anointing gown. This mediaeval chair has a cavity in the base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the &ldquo;Stone of Destiny&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;a canopy of golden cloth is held over the monarch&rsquo;s head for the anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter&hellip;</p>
<p>The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign in the form of a cross on the hands, head, and heart&hellip;the monarch rises from the Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool placed in front of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole anointment process is so sacred and secret that we, the subjects of the King, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrism#Anglicanism_and_Lutheranism">not permitted to view it</a>. The above-mentioned canopy blocks it from the immediate audience of the spectacle. It was not filmed during the otherwise-televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. There are no photos of the procedure as enacted during the ceremonies of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>However, we are allowed to know what the special Coronation Spoon looks like.  Thanks again to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom#/media/File:Coronation_Spoon.png">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/2155178e25.png" width="600" height="125" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the Crown Jewels collection and has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom#Spoon">regularly used</a> for coronations for an astonishing length of time; since at least James I in 1603. But the object itself is far older than that, being the oldest part of the current Crown Jewels, thought to date from something like the 1100s. For sure by 1349 it was already being called &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s coronation was filmed though, despite <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/books/why-elizabeth-iis-1953-coronation-is-the-day-that-changed-television/">her preference</a> that it would not be. Here&rsquo;s the crowning ceremony, should you want to catch up on the prequel to the upcoming May 6th event.</p>

			 <p>It should be noted that whilst Snapchat might be <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/03/so-that-didnt.html">the first major social network</a> to let you directly chat to a cutting-edge AI in the same manner as your friends, there&rsquo;s been several efforts from smaller developers of varying levels of quality and wisdom.</p>
<p><a href="https://godinabox.co/">God In a Box </a>has been around a while, and lets you integrate ChatGPT into Whatsapp, so you can chat to it in the same way as your IRL pals. One of the examples on the home page seems to show someone using it to construct a sick note to send to their employer, good times.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/historical-figures-chat/id6444197650">Historical Figures Chat</a> and its ilk. This genre of AI apps lets you talk to AI versions of historical and/or famous people in a messenger-like interface. Infamously, HFC <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/chatbot-lets-talk-jesus-hitler-180057086.html">provides you with access</a> to none other than the (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/01/31/ai-gpt-chatbot-historical-figures/">inaccurately</a>) simulated mind of Adolf Hitler and his top henchmen. Absolutely no way that could end up being problematic, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

			 <p>So that didn&rsquo;t take long. Snapchat is (I think?) the first of the major social networks to add a <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">&ldquo;chat to AI&rdquo; feature</a>. Currently only available to <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7121577610900-What-is-Snapchat-">its paid users</a>, the AI will appear in the same way as any other human chat participant in the DM list does. So you can easily text it whenever you decide your human friends are too slow, boring or ignorant.</p>
<p>From an interview their CEO gave to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription">the Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The big idea is that in addition to talking to our friends and family every day, we’re going to talk to AI every day,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That all sounds too nice and measured for 2023. I&rsquo;m curious to see whether in fact it turns out that we all start chatting to the robot so much that it reduces our interactions with our human connections in the long term- I mean, you can trust it to never break your snap-streak - or perhaps it&rsquo;ll be a fad that won&rsquo;t generate much interest in the longer term. Honestly, without having any knowledge of the situation, I&rsquo;d more bet on the former.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">billing it</a> as some kind of assistant to improve your human relationships:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My AI can answer a burning trivia question, offer advice on the perfect gift for your BFF’s birthday, help plan a hiking trip for a long weekend, suggest what to make for dinner. My AI is there to help and to connect you more deeply to the people and things you care about most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see many more of these type of integrations happening soon. <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-will-let-developers-build-chatgpt-into-their-apps-204737530.html">opened up its API to developers</a>, such that any app can use its chatGPT technology at a cost of around $0.002 per 750 words of output, which is apparently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34986033">extremely cheap</a> as far as these things go. You can of course still play with chatGPT itself for free at present on <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">OpenAI&rsquo;s own website</a>.</p>

			 <p>One of the new challenges of our era seems destined to be how to prove that you&rsquo;re a human. Not to a website - we&rsquo;ve being doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHAs</a> for ages. So long that, inevitably, computers are now <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2014/04/street-view-and-recaptcha-technology.html">much better at solving them</a> that we are in many cases. But now we need to figure out how to prove we&rsquo;re human to <em>each other</em>.</p>
<p>In a world where AI is being relatively successfully used to <a href="https://tweethunter.io/generate-tweets/">write like us</a>, <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">talk like us</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">look like us</a>, then aside from turning up on each other&rsquo;s doorstep some people are finding their very existence hard to prove to their prospective audience.</p>
<p>The Verge has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23608961/tiktok-creator-bot-accusation-prove-theyre-human">a couple of real world examples</a>, including that of TikTok user Nicole and her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itshermeteor/video/7089021268434947334">burnout video</a>.</p>

<p>When she checked the comments the next day, however, a different conversation was going down. “Jeez, this is not a real human,” one commenter wrote. “I’m scared.” “No legit she’s AI,” another said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“People would come with whole theories in the comments, [they] would say, ‘Hey, check out this second of this. You can totally see the video glitching,” she says. “Or ‘you can see her glitching.’ And it was so funny because I would go there and watch it and be like, ‘What the hell are you talking about?’ Because I know I’m real.”</p>

			 <p>Remember Netflix&rsquo;s 2021 hit &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game">Squid Game</a>&rdquo;, a fictional tale of 456 people who felt desperate enough to play a dangerous game show for the entertainment of shadowy billionaires in order to try to win enough money to live a decent life?</p>
<p>Well, the world being what it is, Netflix&rsquo;s 2023 possible hit &ldquo;<a href="https://www.squidgamecasting.com/">Squid Game</a>&rdquo; is naturally a <em>non</em>-fictional tale of 456 people who felt desperate enough to play a dangerous game show for the enrichment of a shadowy billionaire company in order to try to win enough money to live a decent life.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0JCq_hmNhJs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Now of course this was supposed to be just for fun (well, profit). Less graphic murder, more like an edge-lordy Crystal Maze contained within an ex-RAF base in Bedford, complete with blood packs that explode when you &ldquo;die&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t been going so well.</p>
<p>Recreating a game where contestants have to stand perfectly still when a creepy doll looks at them in UK wintery conditions - Red Light, Green Light, for those who saw the show -  participants <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/21154111/squid-game-horror-contestants-netflix-show-weather/">stood outside in below-zero Celsius temperatures</a> for 7 hours after the scheduled 2 hour sessions overran just a little. Instead of metaphorically freezing in place for 2 minutes at a time, it turned into 15 or more minutes of more literal freezing in place. And then, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/global/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-frozen-inhumane-welfare-1235511809/">in the words</a> of one contestant, Marlene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;this girl was swaying. Then she just buckled, and you could hear her head actually hit the ground. But then someone came on the [microphone] and said to hold our positions because the game is not paused. After that, people were dropping like flies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="uploads/2023/7cd7e00b55.png" width="600" height="337" alt="" />
<figcaption>At least the original Red Light, Green Light looks warm</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Netflix suggest that some of her claims are a little exaggerated but did acknowledge that 3 people needed medical attention during that game.</p>
<p>Another participant described it as &ldquo;like a warzone, people left in tears&rdquo;.  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">The Rolling Stone reports</a> that at least 10 people collapsed during the game. A further contestant thought it was &ldquo;the cruelest, meanest thing I&rsquo;ve ever been through&rdquo;, although they more blamed the incompetency of those running it than the malevolence of the inspirational source material.</p>
<p>All in all, the original fictional show seems to have more provided a somewhat upsetting template for show designers to enact in the real world than a moral message of any kind.</p>
<p>This tendency towards taking a story that is entirely about the terrible results of creating X as inspiration for creating the very X that the story was desperately trying to warn you against creating is something I more associate with big tech and Silicon Valley app designers. See, for example, 90% of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a> episodes. But nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John says he experienced dizziness and a “banging headache” while playing the game: “This game was no longer fun or respectable to those of a certain age. It went beyond being a game,” he says. “But I thought, ‘You know what? It’s $4.56 million. I can do this.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is John from the fictional or real show? Hard to tell except by his reference to a prize worth only around £3.7 million though. Perhaps Netflix&rsquo;s 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/why-is-netflix-losing-so-many-subscribers-and-what-can-it-do-about-it">money woes</a>  restricted them to offer a real cheapskate prize in comparison to the original&rsquo;s £29 million.</p>
<p>Those more concerned with the suffering of their surrounding humans were also placed in a money vs humanity dilemma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People were beating themselves up, including myself, around the fact that you’ve got a girl convulsing and we’re all stood there like statues. On what planet is that even humane?” asks one former contestant. “Obviously, you would jump and help — that’s what our human nature is for most of us. But absolutely it’s a social experiment. It played on our morals and it’s sick. It’s absolutely sick.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone is confused enough about the distinction between fantasy and reality to be thinking, come on, you saw the original, if they didn&rsquo;t break any bones then there&rsquo;s nothing worth worrying about here, well, that happened too. Later on, a woman working on the show inadvertently &ldquo;plunges in horror fall&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/netflix-squid-game-spin-hit-29313364">quote the Sun</a>. She broke her leg in the process. They describe it as &ldquo;its first horror injury&rdquo;, so presumably they&rsquo;re expecting more.</p>
<p>The players themselves suffered a wide arrange of health issues including herniated discs, torn knee tenons, pneumonia and infections, with some of them <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-contestants-netflix-squid-game-182007015.html">considering taking the production studio to court</a> for safety violations, negligence, and false pretenses.</p>
<p>The contestants' critique of the show isn&rsquo;t all about the amount of doctors required to ensure everyone made it through only partially scathed. Some of the &ldquo;false pretenses&rdquo; mentioned above related to  claims that the show doesn&rsquo;t even have the part of the supposed beauty of the original (too soon for spoilers?) - a kind of fairness that everyone is in theory an equal participant, at least to the extent of the resources nature and nurture have bestowed upon them in the time before the game started. But in the 2023 edition there <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">are claims</a> that the show is rigged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">Players allege</a> that it became obvious that some participants appeared to have been pre-selected to make it through the rounds. These folk were biased towards the social media influencer set, and appeared to have been issued working microphones in comparison to the dummy versions the rest had. They were also allowed a degree of flexibility in rule adherence the others weren&rsquo;t, and certainly weren&rsquo;t subject to the &ldquo;38-second massacre&rdquo;, an event surely destined to be written into the history books of the future wherein a large group of the less-favoured contestants saw their blood packs explode substantially after they believed they&rsquo;d won the round.</p>
<p>Presumably in order to save comedy headline writers the effort, during their convalescence some of the contestants already did the pun-work necessary to rename Netflix Squid Game to Net Fix Rigged Game.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529063080">Empire of Pain</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Sackler family, starting with Arthur Sackler. He owned an advertising industry that rather revolutionised the marketing of medicines to doctors.  And not for the better, even in the context of an industry that probably shouldn&rsquo;t exist in the first place. His agency pushed Valium to medical professionals, perfectly happy to make misleading or untruthful claims about the often-times dependency instigating drug all in the name of more sales sales sales.</p>
<p>He shrunk away from the limelight in this context, becoming something of a shadowy figure in terms of his involvement in the business. He much preferred to appear in public as a generous philanthropist and benefactor. Albeit a name-obsessed one, leading to the instigation of many &ldquo;Sackler wings&rdquo; of museums, universities and so on, with little acknowledgement of where all this supposedly philanthropic money came from. But the scandal of what came next was enough such that an array of institutions are now <a href="https://observer.com/2022/03/the-sackler-name-can-now-be-removed-from-any-museum-with-45-days-notice/">trying to rename themselves</a> to something less symbolic of the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Because Arthur&rsquo;s foray into extremely effective pill-pushing was almost small-fry compared to what came next for the family&rsquo;s business dealings. Arthur&rsquo;s brothers, and latterly their children, set themselves up to be the chief marketers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone">OxyContin</a>. This is an opiate developed in 1995 that&rsquo;s substantially more powerful as a painkiller than morphine, which  at the time was mainly used to treat the most severe pain of cancer and terminal patients as it was known to have potentially dangerous side effects including addiction .</p>
<p>But the Sacklers had different plans for OxyContin. They marketing it to doctors as something suitable for everyone who suffers from any even moderate level of pain. With no evidence, and soon enough plenty of counter-evidence, they claimed it wasn&rsquo;t addictive - with a latterly galling slogan of it being a drug to &ldquo;to start with and to stay with&rdquo;. They had their sales people just repeat fake facts, such as that fewer than 1% of patients could become addicted to OxyContin.</p>
<p>When people addicted to Oxy started to turn up, the company was always careful to indulge in victim blaming, arguing something along the lines of &ldquo;because we decided that the drug isn&rsquo;t addictive then this means anyone who seems to be addicted by definition must be of inferior moral character&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Within their pharmaceuticals company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma">Purdue Pharma</a>, they created and seemingly reveled in an atmosphere of willful ignorance and deliberate falsehoods, pushing doctors to purchase and prescribe more and higher doses of Oxycontin, no matter how appropriate the treatment was for the condition. There was also seemingly a fairly astonishing amount of corruption in the supposed regulators, the US FDA, who went ahead and approved the drug and some of its promo materials based on claims that they were fully aware had never been tested.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and mass Oxy usage is heavily associated with opiate &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, both directly, and also as a pipeline that ends up with black market substitutes. The opiate epidemic has <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01653-6/fulltext">killed hundreds of thousands of people</a> and created millions of addicts in the US alone. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/prescribed.html">CDC currently reports</a> that up to 1 in 4 people receiving long-term opioid therapy in a primary care setting may struggle with addiction.</p>
<p>The Oxy business is thus an example of one of those big conspiracies that turn out to be true. It&rsquo;s not that producing opiates is a problem. They&rsquo;re an important class of drugs that are very useful for specific medical conditions in specific contexts. It&rsquo;s the lying and cheating involved in mass-marketing them, as  entirely safe and problematic-side-effect free solutions to any form of pain,  in full knowledge of the human cost of doing so that is truly horrific.</p>
<p>The Sacklers&rsquo;s pharma marketing business is easily up there with, say, the tobacco industry and the oil industry in terms of companies that knowingly inflict harm on the world whilst actively lying about it. 
Purdue is a privately held company, owned by some of an extremely wealthy family who so loved to show off their extraordinarily hypocritical philanthropy - so it doesn&rsquo;t even have the always-invalid excuse of &ldquo;shareholder interest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s in some ways a tedious conspiracy, contra to the wilder accusations that fly around the world these days - just another example of appalling outcomes emanating from the actions and intention of people who just seem to want to become richer and richer, no matter how wealthy they become, no matter the human cost or obvious ethical breaches. They do what they do, largely unconstrained by the wholly inadequate systems we supposedly put in place to limit the social harms that we allow to be done in the name of profit.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s author wrote <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">a piece for the New Yorker</a> a while back on the same topic which is well worth a read if you don&rsquo;t feel like tackling the whole book.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/19/the-body-keeps.html">The Body Keeps the Score: how and why traumatic events impact us</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/19/the-body-keeps.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-20 12:45:49 &#43;0000">Feb 20, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141978611">The Body Keeps the Score</a> by Bessel A Van der Kolk.</p>
<p>This reads like an very comprehensive book about the grim impact that experiencing trauma can have on many aspects of subsequent life as a human, and what we can do about it.</p>
<p>It gets into the science a fair bit, explaining the impact that trauma has on the functioning on one&rsquo;s brain, mind and of course the titular body. For whilst those impacted might find ways to push what they went through out of their mind most of the time, whether through continuously effortful mental work, chemical escapism or other risky and numbing behaviours, their bodies may remain in a state of constant stress.</p>
<p>This ever-present fight-or-flight response dramatically lowers one&rsquo;s ability to fully engage in everyday life. So survivors sometimes find themselves alone, keeping secrets from others and indeed themselves, struggling to form quality connections and relationships or do much of anything beyond the minimum necessary to simply get through the day. They may feel entirely numb, unable to interpret, trust or control their inner physical and mental experience, or exhibit seemingly inexplicable violent outbursts. Continual output of stress hormones also cause problems with memory, attention, mood, sleep, learning and many other health issues.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t need to be the case though. The author is at pains to say we do know a lot about the causes of trauma now, as well as some effective solutions. However classic mainstream psychiatry does not embrace many of them, preferring to restrict itself to the use of pharmaceuticals and talking therapy.</p>
<p>He regards both these conventional approaches as having their use, but not as close to being the be-all and end-all of what treatments should be offered. Drugs might successfully help a patient get through the day whilst they&rsquo;re taking them, but fail to address the underlying cause of their condition or allow for full engagement in life. Talking therapies may not even be possible for patients who in truth presently unable to communicate their experience to others.</p>
<p>And many patients never even get a trauma diagnosis, instead receiving a set of disparate individual mental and physical diagnoses. The former are often a hodge-podge taken from whatever the latest <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm">DSM</a> categories of mental disorder are. It&rsquo;s a approach of diagnosis and treatment by symptoms rather than cause, which has long been discredited in other fields.</p>
<p>A more wide-ranging and effective response would be to combine those approaches with others. Some of his suggestions sounded a little incredible to me at first, but apparently all have increasing amounts of experiential and scientific evidence as to their effectiveness. And it&rsquo;s not like for the most part we can definitively explain the mechanisms for why conventional pharmaceuticals or talking therapies work.</p>
<p>His recommendations include yoga, communal activities such as singing breathing and chanting, mindfulness, experiencing touch, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, writing, Internal Family Systems therapy, psychomotor therapy, neurofeedback, taking part in a theatrical production and more. One of the commonalities across many of those is the aim to teach the body and mind that it&rsquo;s safe, particularly in the presence of other humans. They also offer the possibility of integrating, rather than concealing, one&rsquo;s traumatic memories from others and yourself. If all goes well, then strategies that subconsciously you may be using to hide the unbearable pain from yourself will one day no longer be required, allowing you to go ahead and flourish in everyday life.</p>
<p>Despite not being a particularly new book, it has famously hit the best-seller list a whole lot in recent times - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/">150 weeks</a> on the New York Times' list! -  selling millions of copies to an audience far wider than one might naively expect to be interested in a book that&rsquo;s edging towards a more academic way of writing at times. It&rsquo;s even the basis for at least at least <a href="https://twitter.com/jasminprix/status/1379079318471540745">a couple</a> of  <a href="https://twitter.com/sydneyelainexo/status/1371679472798339073?lang=en">semi-viral tweets</a> .</p>
<p>Part of this may be due to the unfortunate fact that trauma should not be thought of as solely the preserve of soldiers returning from combat and refugees fleeing genocide.</p>
<p>The book presents some truly harrowing statistics of how common events with potentially similar health effects are; 20% of Americans apparently being sexually molested as a child, 25% beaten as a child, a third of couples experiencing physical violence and so it goes on. The feminist movement has also helped the world understand that up to half of it&rsquo;s population may feel varying degrees of threat and endangerment in their lives on the basis of their gender alone.</p>
<p>One perhaps related thing to note is that the book does contain descriptions of traumatic events. I&rsquo;ve noticed several discussions online whereby people have noted that they find themselves triggered by these, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/a93qs7/reading_the_body_keeps_the_score_is_triggering_a/">here</a> for instance. Perhaps some caution is to be advised if that&rsquo;s something that might affect you. But other people feel seen and affirmed by its contents even if it was tremendously difficult reading for them, so YMMV for sure.</p>
<p>Another contributor to its recent popularity would likely be the Covid-19 pandemic, although interestingly the author <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/">doesn&rsquo;t consider </a>the general experience of the pandemic a collective trauma in the sense he&rsquo;s writing about. I guess this may be because it&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t intuit as shameful, as something we must hide from ourselves and others, in the same way as other traumatising incidents manifest. Everyone has &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; the pandemic, albeit in different ways, with vastly different levels of comfort and safety. Many people have been lucky enough to have been able to maintain many of their most significant social connections, as frightening, isolating and limiting as the experience has has been.</p>
<p>Although surely the aspect of continuously feeling under threat must have been, and still be, some people&rsquo;s experience. And it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible to me that it&rsquo;s been more &ldquo;conventionally&rdquo; traumatic for those either on the frontlines of it - for example medical professionals making life or death decisions, witnessing hundreds of people experiencing unpleasant deaths that they cannot realistically to do anything about - or those already in vulnerable situations for which the simultaneous isolation and closure of a lot of the world may have been too much to bear.</p>

			 <p>🎙 Listened to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0c5w0zm">Unreal: A Critical History of Reality TV</a> podcast.</p>
<p>Part fondly reminiscing of reality show days of yore - remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bateman_(television_personality)">Nasty Nick</a>? -  and part analysing the destructive effects some of them may have had on the contestants, and perhaps us, the audience.</p>
<p>Some of the shows that were made a few years ago now seem like extremely bad ideas when viewed in the light of more modern, hopefully progressive, sensibilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious offenders that came up were the three below. Fortunately none of them are still being made as far as I can tell.</p>
<h3 id="the-swan">The Swan</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swan_(TV_series)">A show</a> which found some ugly ducklings and gave them an extreme makeover over the course of 3 month, using personal trainers, therapists, dentists and cosmetic surgeons. Then whichever one of the modified women was deemed most attractive gets to enter a beauty pageant, with the eventual winner becoming, of course, the Swan.</p>
<p>Naturally it would be too much to hope that this &ldquo;<a href="https://nypost.com/2013/02/20/rearview-mirror-the-most-sadistic-reality-series-of-the-decade-is-back/">most sadistic reality series of the decade&rdquo;</a> is some kind of bizarre wildlife show. The ugly ducklings are in fact, unfortunately, inevitably, actual human women. Many of whom have since gone through all sorts of traumatic stuff, sometimes relating to a lack of follow-up aftercare for the huge numbers of surgeries they had.</p>
<p>It also got into a bit of trouble for splicing together quotes in <a href="https://ew.com/article/2005/06/30/reality_franken/">very misleading ways</a>. This taught me the term &ldquo;Frankenbiting&rdquo; which is to create non-existent situations via cutting splicing together footage is misleading ways.</p>
<p>To say nothing of any impact it may have had on its audience and society in general, enmeshed in &ldquo;a genre of popular culture which positions work on the body as a morally correct solution to personal problems&rdquo;, to quote <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15295030903583515?journalCode=rcsm20">Alice Marwick</a>.</p>
<h3 id="whos-your-daddy">Who&rsquo;s your Daddy?</h3>
<p>Upsettingly, the question in the title of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Your_Daddy%3F_(TV_program)">this show</a> isn&rsquo;t rhetorical. Eight men try to convince TJ Myers, an adopted woman, that they are her biological father. If she gets it wrong then the man she thought was her father gets a cash prize. What more is there to say?</p>
<p>Adoption rights advocates were not very pleased, with comments like &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t just offensive, it&rsquo;s destructive&rdquo; and &ldquo;Publicity and contests and deception and money should not be involved&rdquo; <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/whos-your-daddy-reality-show-outrage-20041216-gdkbkl.html">abounding from experts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="theres-something-about-miriam">There&rsquo;s Something About Miriam</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_Something_About_Miriam">this one</a> we have a set of men competing for the affections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Rivera">Miriam Rivera</a>. That kind of premise has often struck me as a little problematic in most of the near infinite amount of variations it&rsquo;s received over the years. But in this instance there&rsquo;s a special, for want of a very different word, &ldquo;twist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Miriam is a trans woman, as the show liked to make  clear to the audience with heavy use of innuendo and crass exploitation, but only clear to the participants after one of them had won her heart or whatever winning the competition was supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Naturally it didn&rsquo;t go great when they did. The show&rsquo;s release was delayed by the contestants suing it for psychological and emotional damage. Miriam herself unfortunately died some years later, aged 37, officially by suicide (although her husband believes it was murder).  The idea that this could ever be anything other than crass and offensive seems extremely unfathomable, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s just 2023 talking.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/10/the-inherent-unpredictability.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-10 18:40:26 &#43;0000">Feb 10, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-2023-gaziantep">devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake</a> and its aftershocks that hit Turkey and Syria earlier this week has now claimed substantially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/09/earthquake-turkey-syria-in-turkiye-2023-live-updates-latest-news-maps-quake-death-toll-kahramanmaras">more than 20,000 lives</a>.</p>
<p>This reminds me that one reason that major earthquakes tend to cause more deaths than hurricanes is that, even with all the fancy data and science and AI we have in 2023, they remain essentially unpredictable. We&rsquo;ve made massive strides in recent decades in terms of improving our ability to predict hurricanes or the weather, but almost none in terms of getting to accurate and specific predictions of earthquakes.</p>
<p>In case that seems unlikely, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/">US Geological Survey</a> themselves <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-you-predict-earthquakes">do not hold back</a> on answering that question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you predict earthquakes? No. Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair seismologists do have a pretty specific definition of &ldquo;predict&rdquo;. We can certainly say something about rates and magnitudes, for instance that in a particular region of the world there is a 40% probability that we&rsquo;ll see an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 within the next 10 years. This means that we  know that some regions have many more earthquakes than others. But no-one yet can say anything remotely close to &ldquo;tomorrow there will be a massive earthquake in your city&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;within the next 10 years&rdquo; in the above statement should be thought of as a rate. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you haven&rsquo;t had an earthquake in 9 years then you&rsquo;ll probably have one next year. But rather that for any given year you should act as though there is a 10% chance of such an event. Don&rsquo;t fall into a geological version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy</a>!</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for us to predict earthquakes? In his book &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658">The Signal and the Noise</a>&rdquo;, Nate Silver dedicates most of a chapter to the topic. Overall, it seems like we just don&rsquo;t know enough about what causes them and can&rsquo;t measure every one of their constituent parts at a granular enough level. They can be thought of as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">complex system</a> in which fairly simple-to-understand things interact with each other in ways that are essentially mysterious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These types of systems exhibit non-linear properties and have steep feedback loops that mean tiny changes to one part of the model can end up wreaking absolute havoc to another of its aspect. These systems tend to remain static for most of the time, but then occasionally fail in a catastrophic way.</p>
<p>As large earthquakes are rare, our inability to do anything beyond forecasting long term probabilities of suffering from a major earthquake is particularly dangerous for countries without access to great wealth. It&rsquo;s hard or impossible for poorer locales to prioritise taking very expensive precautions against these devastating events when it may be very unlikely that the event will happen in any particular year.</p>
<p>Of course the wealth side of that is a solvable problem should the world decide that protecting the population of its most vulnerable countries is something that should become a moral priority, whether or not we ever come to fully understand the physics of earthquakes.</p>

			 <p>🎙 This week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/podcasts/hard-fork-technology.html">Hard Fork podcast</a> had an interesting section on the origin story of <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, creators of the incredible <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT bot</a> amongst other things.</p>
<p>Apparently GPT-3, the language model <a href="https://dev.to/ben/the-difference-between-chatgpt-and-gpt-3-19dh">it is largely based on</a>,  is 3 year-old technology and they have a GPT-4 model to wow us with in the future 0 although the OpenAI CEO recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23560328/openai-gpt-4-rumor-release-date-sam-altman-interview">warned us</a> not to get too excited.</p>
<p>The interest in chatGPT has been absolutely phenomenal, with 30 million users signing up within the first two months after it was released, 5 million of which became daily users.</p>
<p>All that said, it&rsquo;s not been an unmitigated success for everyone in the world of infusing AI into our internet experience this week. Yesterday <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-integration/">Microsoft&rsquo;s Chat-GPT-Bing integration</a> was confidently responding to the search query &ldquo;Is it safe to boil a baby?&rdquo; with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s seemingly now fixed - or rather I don&rsquo;t see an AI answer at all this morning. To be fair I don&rsquo;t know who first dreamt up that particular question. let&rsquo;s hope it wasn&rsquo;t a genuine enquiry.</p>
<p>And then Google <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1622710355775393793">released a video</a> showing it&rsquo;s similarly-targeted &ldquo;Bard&rdquo; AI in action. Although unfortunately one of the answers it gave to a query was <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2358426-google-bard-advert-shows-new-ai-search-tool-making-a-factual-error/">simply wrong</a>. It was obscure enough that I likely wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed; another example of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/11/chatgpt-is-a-marvel-but-its-ability-to-lie-convincingly-is-its-greatest-danger-to-humankind">fluent bullshit</a>&rdquo; that these models appear unfortunately predisposed generate in between their genuinely wonderous answers.</p>
<p>In any case, contrary to Bard&rsquo;s claim. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope">James Webb telescope</a> did not take the first picture of a planet outside our solar system. That telescope was launched on Christmas day 2021, in a world where that particularly exoplanetary feat had already been accomplished <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/300/2m1207-b-first-image-of-an-exoplanet">at least as long ago as 2004</a>, by the imaginatively named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope">Very Large Telescope.</a></p>
<p>Stock markets being as stock markety as ever, that mistake apparently shredded <a href="https://time.com/6254226/alphabet-google-bard-100-billion-ai-error/">over $100 billion</a> off the value of Google.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-traitors-2023">The Traitors</a> (US version).</p>
<p>Well it was hard to resist watching it after getting <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/09/watched-season-of.html">more excited about the UK series</a> than I should have. Although sadly it takes place in the exact same place with the exact same missions and rules. This made it relatively uninteresting until towards the end when we &ldquo;knew&rdquo; enough about the contestants to care; at least outside of the opportunity to contrast British vs American culture as performed by paranoid gameshow contestants.</p>
<p>However the ending was rather more engaging and dramatic than I was expecting, so if you already made it most of the way through then it&rsquo;s worth sticking around for the last episode.</p>
<p>There is a slightly different dynamic in that half of the contestants in the US version are some kind of celebrity (defining celebrity here as meaning &ldquo;was prominent on another reality TV show&rdquo;). Whilst I didn&rsquo;t bother to check, I assume  thus means some of them are extremely rich already, in which case there&rsquo;s a whole added layer of voyeuristic grimness on the part of us, the audience,  in watching them steal money from each other by pretending to be their best friend.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the contestants did not in fact stay in the castle where the shows implies they sleep, with one eye open, waiting to be murdered. Rather, they were <a href="https://screenrant.com/traitors-alan-cumming-reveals-contestants-sleeping-castle/">forced to endure</a> whatever airport hotel they have in Inverness.</p>
<p>Again, I hope the contestents get some serious counselling once they leave.</p>

Not the full, real, complete and engaging experience we know is out there and if only we could solve problems X and Y  we would achieve it; but rather something smaller and much less satisfactory.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11042121-there-is-a-strange-attitude-and-feeling-that-one-is">Marie-Louise von Franz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strange feeling that one is not yet in real life. For the time being, one is doing this or that… [but] there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s extremely rare that solving problems X and Y alleviates this condition. We just find a new problem Z that once again is holding us back from escaping the limitations and suffering imposed upon our current imprisoned self.</p>
<p>Knowing that almost everyone else also feels this might be more reassuring in that you can understand that it&rsquo;s really a product of universal human psychology, not something especially deficient about your own personal existence.</p>
<p>But it could also perhaps feel less reassuring, in that it&rsquo;s a feeling that it&rsquo;s very likely you&rsquo;re going to have to put up with for the rest of your life, one way or another. You are never going to get to a point in life wherein you encounter no problems. No-one does.</p>
<p>Burkeman&rsquo;s solution is perhaps the only option that could exist, even if it&rsquo;s not exactly something that would feature on an &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; poster or influencer Instagram story. Accept that the universe doesn&rsquo;t owe you an unconstrained hassle-free life. And it&rsquo;s nothing you can realistically get to via your own efforts. So just embrace, or at least accept, the truth. Relax. Participate fully in the life you do have. Don&rsquo;t waste time and energy dwelling on the one you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out my really big problem was thinking I might one day get rid of all my problems, when the truth is that there&rsquo;s no escaping the mucky, malodorous compost-heap of this reality.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781524759797">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch.</p>
<p>A gripping tale set in the world of approximately today, except for the existence of an epidemic of &ldquo;False Memory Syndrome&rdquo;. Sufferers of this condition develop memories of a life that they never lived. This proves to be disconcerting to the point of people throwing themselves out of windows in despair.</p>
<p>Separately, or is it separately (spoiler: no), a scientist is working on a technology to help people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease preserve their favourite memories.</p>
<p>I really liked this, playing as it does with big ideas around psychology, technology, time and motivation. Being sci-fi in nature there&rsquo;s a good amount of techno-magic, but it&rsquo;s presented in a way that feels internally consistent and as logical as something like this can be. It makes me want to read the rest of Blake Crouch&rsquo;s novels.</p>

<p>The fluffy feel-good story of the fashionista who always comes out on top continues. No matter what mildly awkward minor mishaps befall her personal life she&rsquo;s always in demand.</p>
<p>Too many companies want her to work for them, too many people fall in love with her, too many people watch her livestreams, too many massive clients flock to her accounts. Her colleagues live in a state of perpetual annoyance because of how many great ideas she has. A life, and apartment, we can all aspire to.</p>
<p>The best part is of course the clothes. This was my favourite outfit this season, resembling as it does the mesh sponge thing I use in the shower.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780525560548">Hood Feminism</a> by Mikki Kendall.</p>
<p>This is a searing critique of modern day mainstream feminism, at least as practiced in the US, as frequently excluding the very women who are usually the most oppressed by the system.</p>
<p>It takes aim particularly at &ldquo;White middle-class feminism&rdquo; characterising it as getting fixated on battles such as increasing the number of female middle managers who become CEOs. But this fight comes at the expense of tackling issues of true survival such as inadequate food, housing, gun violence and healthcare that are regularly experienced in silence by women in marginalised communities.</p>
<p>The author sees the truth as being that some women have the power to oppress other women. And too often the feminist fight has effectively been in the service of giving some women an &ldquo;equal right to oppress&rdquo; as the more privileged men have in a society that remains infused with ideas of white supremacy, rather than to enable the most marginalised women to live a decent life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure its arguments and style are controversial in some quarters. But it&rsquo;s certainly one of those fascinating and unsettling books that may cause some of us who identify as progressive some inner turmoil, rightfully so.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">Cory Doctorow&#39;s theory of &#34;platform enshittification&#34;</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-27 18:15:18 &#43;0000">Jan 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">a recent post</a>, Cory Doctorow explained his theory of &ldquo;platform enshittification&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enabled by (particularly online) platforms, being the middleman between the purveyors of &ldquo;content&rdquo; and their audience, having the ability to directly change how much value they hand out each party and themselves.</p>
<p>In stage 1, the platform wants to attract users, so it dedicates most of the value it generates to them. Us willing consumers embrace this wonderful deal and sign up en masse. Businesses see how many users are on the platform and started becoming interested themselves.</p>
<p>In stage 2, the platform starts shifting the value to the suppliers. The consumer experience declines whilst the platform redirects its value towards its suppliers. They pay businesses or creators to use them. They offer an unmissably cheap way to access big audiences of avid potential consumers just desperate to throw money at them; the users from step 1. Businesses sign up en masse.</p>
<p>In the final stage, the platform starts taking more and more of the value for itself. They take vast swathes of fees from businesses, and deluge consumers in whatever substandard experience is deemed most optimal to generate revenue for the platform&rsquo;s shareholders, just one level away from being so horrible that the users quit.</p>
<p>This, according to Doctorow, is the death knell for a platform.</p>
<p>He sees this happening  with Amazon, which started off making it very convenient for people to find and make good purchases at great prices. They  subsidised each sale, causing many of their competitors to close. We loved the prices, and the convenience. Signing up to Amazon Prime for free shipping meant we&rsquo;d not look elsewhere.</p>
<p>So businesses felt compelled to join as Marketplace sellers. In phase 2 Amazon switched subsidies away from the buyers and to these businesses, providing  big audiences with small commissions, and generous payments for creators.</p>
<p>Finally when both buyers and sellers were dependent on Amazon, they shifted the value proposition away from the third-party businesses and to their own shareholders. Seller fees went up and it became expensive to get your product anywhere likely to be seen in a search unless you paid for increasingly expensive advertising. Commensurately, consumers needed to dig deep if they wanted to avoid seeing anything other than spammy ads only tangentially relevant to their searches.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Facebook, who first made it easy for us to connect with our friends and family. We&rsquo;d see everything they had to say, all the nice photos they had and so on. What&rsquo;s not to love for a user?</p>
<p>In stage 2, they starting forcing users to see posts from people and businesses they never followed. This provided vast amounts of traffic to, for example, newspaper sites. They let third-party businesses microtarget advertising to huge numbers of consumers for not much money.</p>
<p>Finally, in phase 3, once dependency had set in, Facebook cut off the ability for companies to push stories and links into users' feeds unless they paid for the privilege via advertising. Ad prices inevitably went up at the same time as a raft of rules were introduced to keep the user squarely on Facebook rather than the advertiser&rsquo;s own site. Businesses have to throw money at Facebook in the hope that it&rsquo;ll force users see a post that they had no desire to ever see, but ideally from the Facebook&rsquo;s point of view, not one quite so unpleasant that they&rsquo;ll leave the platform entirely.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/26/cognitive-biases-as.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-26 18:18:07 &#43;0000">Jan 26, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by <a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-radical-idea-that-people-arent">Adam Mastroianni&rsquo;s framing</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> as being akin to visual illusions.</p>
<p>Often we look at all these &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; biases- everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">Anchoring bias</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik effect</a> - as deficiencies in our brain, failures in reasoning. Even more so when we think that we see others falling prey to them whilst we ourselves are of course clever, unbiased, objective thinkers (see also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">fundamental attribution error</a> bias).</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t poke fun at people for being able to see visual illusions. We don&rsquo;t laugh at them for being bad at seeing. Often you can know an illusion is an illusion and still not be unable to see the effect; it&rsquo;s not a matter of education or sophistication. Sure, you can program yourself to say &ldquo;squares A and B are the same colour&rdquo; but you can&rsquo;t necessarily viscerally <em>sense</em> that they are.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/425c7213d1.png" width="397" height="306" alt="" />
<p>(image from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Rather, we take these illusions as evidence of what your visual system does in order to process the unimaginably large input that is everyday reality into something you can understand and act on. Seeing the things that aren&rsquo;t there in visual illusions is evidence that your visual system is working <em>well</em>.  They simply reveal what  is being done behind the scenes by a healthy visual processing system.</p>
<p>Likewise, responding to cognitive illusions is not necessarily a matter of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your brain is deficient&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re just the healthy and natural result of the incredible set of assumptions and processing shortcuts your brain has at its disposal to let you live a rich and full life in a world that&rsquo;s far too complex for you to fully comprehend.</p>
<p>All this of course doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t work to reduce our tendency towards cognitive biases, most critically on the occasions where their end product is one that causes harm to ourselves or other people. But the fact that someone has the bias does not make them stupid.</p>

			 <p>The FT has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/741772c0-ee76-4d3d-bfcd-4fabc1fb405d">a fascinating look</a> into life as a high-ranking female spy now that for the first time ever 3 out of the 4 of the Director Generals of Britain&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">Secret Intelligence Service</a>, aka MI6, are women.</p>
<p>Such high ranking positions have traditionally been the preserve of men, with women mostly being recruited as secretaries or for the purpose of honeytraps.

			 <p>In &ldquo;products I&rsquo;m really not sure need to exist&rdquo; news, a company called <a href="https://reviver.com/">Reviver</a> will sell  you an app-enabled digital number plate for your car, if you live in one of the very few US states where it&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>It seems to be yet another way companies have found to add ongoing subscriptions to your driving experience - I may return to this topic soon. In return for your $20-25 a month, it enables such unmissable features as being able to switch your number plate into dark mode and displaying a tiny app-controlled banner under the plate; essentially a microtweet for anyone driving way too close to you I guess.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/35ec6da359.png" width="400" height="282" alt="" />
<p>One feature that I can actually see some potential use for is that it contains enough tracking technology that you can see the location of your car by using the accompanying app.</p>
<p>The problem is that until recently it wasn&rsquo;t just you and Reviver that could see where you are. Security researchers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxn9vx/researchers-track-reviver-digital-license-plate-gps-location">managed to find a way</a> to alter their own user account so that they could see the live location of every vehicle who had one of these number plates. And <a href="https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry/">a lot more</a> besides:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Track the physical GPS location and manage the license plate for all Reviver customers (e.g. changing the slogan at the bottom of the license plate to arbitrary text)</li>
<li>Update any vehicle status to “STOLEN” which updates the license plate and informs authorities</li>
<li>Access all user records, including what vehicles people owned, their physical address, phone number, and email address</li>
<li>Access the fleet management functionality for any company, locate and manage all vehicles in a fleet</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That vulnerability has been fixed now. But it&rsquo;s events like this that make me wonder whether it&rsquo;s really necessary to put app connections and internet-connected surveillance technology in <em>absolutely everything</em> a product designer can dream up, even if it&rsquo;s possible to imagine the odd use for it.</p>

			 <p>Played <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a> 🎮.</p>
<p>This is a turn-based strategy game in which you control mech pilots to save the world from alien invasion. Not the most original storyline and by it&rsquo;s look I first assumed it was akin to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM">XCOM series</a>. But it&rsquo;s not really, because here you know exactly what your enemies are going to do in advance, with no guessing or random luck involved. In some ways it felt more like a puzzle game.</p>
<p>If you lose you get sent back to the beginning to try again. Often I find that style of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a>&rdquo; game frustratingly repetitive. But here the missions differ a bit each playthrough. You also have the ability to upgrade your mechs in different ways and  unlock lots of new characters so it doesn&rsquo;t get boring. You get the chance to send one of your heroes back through time which gives me the sense of not having lost all my progress (when I remember to do it).</p>
<p>Each fight takes place within small land grid and only takes a few minutes to play, making it well suited to mobile devices, although it&rsquo;s available on all sorts of platforms. It won a lot of awards in past years, deservedly so. And if you&rsquo;re a Netflix subscriber you can <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/22/im-one-of.html">play it for free</a>.</p>

			 <p>Microsoft has created <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111">a language model called &ldquo;Vall-E&rdquo;</a> that can simulate a person&rsquo;s voice saying whatever they choose with the only input needed from the person being 3 second clip of the actual person saying something. I guess a fraction of a TikTok video would do the job.</p>
<p>It can even preserve emotion - so if you have a 3 second clip of your friend angrily shouting about something then they could in theory make a clip of your friend angrily shouting about something completely different.</p>
<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t think you can play with the model yourself. Some people might feel that&rsquo;s in some ways for the best , until society has figured out some idea of how we&rsquo;re going to deal with the sheer amount of future &ldquo;recordings&rdquo; of things that never happened that everyone is going to be able to produce with minimal effort using with tools like this and the various other generative AI type tools that are already out there.</p>
<p>But I imagine someone else will release a more public tool all too soon. It didn&rsquo;t take long for folk to figure out how to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgygy4/stable-diffusion-stability-ai-nsfw-ai-generated-porn">get AI tools to generate images</a> that are really rather against what most of the systems designers involved wanted them to do.</p>
<p>In the mean time you can hear some Vall-E samples on <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">this page</a>. Scroll down a bit and compare the &ldquo;Speaker Prompts&rdquo; - which are the 3 second actual recordings of someone&rsquo;s voice they fed it - with the &ldquo;VALL-E&rdquo; output, which is what the model produced based on it.</p>

			 <p>Prepare yourself for the <a href="https://www.itv.com/">ITV</a> sketch show &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">Deep Fake Neighbour Wars</a>&rdquo;, the first mainstream UK TV show based on deepfake technology (as far as I know).</p>
<p>Appearing on ITVX on the 26th January, it&rsquo;s a comedy sketch show seemingly showing people living their everyday mundane lives. Except these aren&rsquo;t either characters created for the show or actors doing impressions of other people. They are &lsquo;real&rsquo; megastar celebrities - well, real in the sense that they look and and sound like them, even though the celebrities concerned haven&rsquo;t been anywhere near it.</p>
<p>Instead, the show was first acted out by less well-known actors. <a href="https://studioneural.ai/">StudioNeural</a> - &ldquo;the world’s first provider of synthetic media for long form TV&rdquo; -  then used deepfake technology to replace their faces with ultra-realistic visages of actual bigtime celebrities.</p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/783628968?h=b9aa70b52a&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>From a <a href="https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/fyi/104/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-preview/">summary of the preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We meet loved up Nicki Minaj and Tom Holland who are not happy with Mark Zuckerberg next door, Idris Elba gets a shock when new neighbour Kim Kardashian starts making her presence known in their communal garden, Harry Kane&rsquo;s perfect patio is damaged by upstairs neighbour Stormzy and dental hygienist Billie Eilish clashes with neighbour Beyonce when she starts working from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainstreaming deep fake technology for entertainment like this does feel like a potential turning point for popularizing this technology. It&rsquo;ll allow things to be done that never otherwise could have been. Up until now deepfakes have usually been discussed as in the context of nefarious use-cases -  fake news, fraudulent political persuasion, personal attacks or revenge porn. But even for entirely benign uses, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">the Guardian notes</a>, there&rsquo;s not really much in the way of established etiquette or guidelines for the use of this very new technology yet.</p>
<p>What is fair in the name of comedy, vs what is some kind of unethical exploitation? Whether this be of the celebrities or the relatively nameless actors who are hidden behind the fakes (until the end of the show anyway in this particular case).</p>
<p>Unless a message is constantly superimposed over the broadcast that this isn&rsquo;t real, what are the implications in a world where it&rsquo;s extremely common for short clips to be taken out of videos and shared on social media?</p>
<p>To borrow an example from the same article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image">Spitting Image</a> was an extremely funny satire (the original one at least), but how would it have come across if instead of using caricature puppets the show used representations of the people being satirised that were basically indistinguishable from their actual IRL selves?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Dorries">Nadine Dorries</a>, admittedly someone who one might argue has a strong agenda of her own, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-11222675/NADINE-DORRIES-England-fake-cruel-know-Prime-Ministers-dreams.html">was worried </a>that the <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/this-england">This England</a> TV drama which purports to document a dramatised version of how the UK government dealing with Covid-19 (amongst other things) was dangerous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, the producers put a disclaimer before each episode, stating that the drama is fictional, based on true events. But the fact that scenes are interspersed with real news footage makes it very deceptive. Also, many scenes involving politicians and civil servants are eerily convincing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much more convincing would it have been if Boris Johnson was played by his digital doppelganger as opposed to Kenneth Branagh?</p>

			 <p>Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-traitors-2022/seasons/1">season 1 of The Traitors</a> 📺.</p>
<p>A reality show where by day a group of strangers complete missions to build up a prize pot, and by night they viciously accuse each other of treachery in order to eject them from the show entirely.</p>
<p>Which is fair enough, because a few of them are in fact traitors. Claudia Winkelman secretly assigned them that role at the start. The viewer knows who they are, the participants do not. They have to figure it out by whatever means they can. Each night they must vote out the person they collectively believe is most traitorous. Of course, to maintain their subterfuge the traitors also have to pretend that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing too and put their public votes in too.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; vote out all the traitors then they share the prize pot. But if even one traitor remains by the end of the series then the surviving traitors get it all.</p>
<p>Each night whilst the others sleep the anonymous traitors also get to metaphorically kill one of the contestants, kicking them off the show without the ability to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Honestly, it feels a little grim and exploitative to watch. I really hope there&rsquo;s a pile of expert psychologists behind the scenes to help the players cope with the virulent suspicion, deception, mistrust, arguments, paranoia, confrontations and the rest of it.</p>
<p>But watching the participants - the genuinely legit and the traitors trying to appear as such - try to figure out who the traitors are provides incredible examples of all sorts of cognitive biases - confirmation bias, the halo effect, salience bias, a kind of pareidolia, overconfidence, the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy and a ton of herd instinct to name but a few. And all this at the same time as  being put into an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating example of all these psychological processes going on, some that we can probably recognise very well in ourselves if we stop and think about it for a minute in between screaming at the TV, that it turns out to be compulsive viewing. Even if it&rsquo;s probably not exactly great for most of the folk involved.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s getting on for four months since Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested in Iran for not wearing her hijab in the style the authorities prefer, died when in the custody of the Iranian police after being beaten. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests">The resulting protests</a> are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64062900">ongoing</a>, at incredible personal risk to the brave souls who take part and their loved ones.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/revealed-nhs-trusts-tell-patients-they-can-go-private-and-jump-hospital-queues">Today&rsquo;s Observer</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NHS trusts with record waiting lists are promoting “quick and easy” private healthcare services at their own hospitals, offering patients the chance to jump year-long queues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, whilst not a new thing, does not feel good in the midst of a growing NHS crisis, particularly if it&rsquo;s on the rise. The private services that are provided  - whether a £300 MRI scan or a £10,000 hip replacement - supposedly don&rsquo;t impact the services the NHS provides under its public funding. But they often take place in the same premises with the same staff that you would get if you made it to the top of the public waiting list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some technicality that allows them to say it&rsquo;s not sucking resources from our still much loved public health system. But, simplistically, at the end of the day it surely is potential life-or-death British medical capacity that is exclusively available to the rich rather than the person that needs it the most.</p>
<p>The ideal of course would be that the NHS working conditions and funding was improved such that there was no incentive for hospitals or medical staff to operate a private practice at all. For now though, we&rsquo;ll have to decide whether to laugh or cry at the <a href="https://www.theshalbourne.co.uk/about/why-choose-us/">Shalborune Private Health Care website&rsquo;s claim</a> that &ldquo;We believe quality healthcare should be readily accessible.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been the longest contest for the position since 1859, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/05/from-the-nyt.html">preventing any of the real business of the House taking place</a> whilst the battle continued.</p>
<p>But if it felt like a long time, it was certainly no 1855. That contest <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64178794">stretched on for two whole months</a> and required 133 ballots to take place before a speaker was selected.</p>
<p>In the end they temporarily changed the rules so as to accept a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">plurality of votes</a> as opposed to the standard absolute majority rules that require the victor to have gotten the support of at least half of the voters. This allowed Nathaniel Banks won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">the contest</a> with 103 votes from a possible 214 electors.</p>
<p>The repeated election attempts over the past few days apparently became so tedious that the representatives elect started <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-mayhem-during-kevin-mccarthys-14th-bid-for-house-speaker-2023-1">bringing in</a> comics, books, iPad games and their own children in order to keep themselves entertained.

<p>Starting to get into the years I actually remember something about now. I love this as a way of accidentally learning the country&rsquo;s history. The only problem is it seems a lot of it isn&rsquo;t true. John Major seems to be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11319595/Boycott-hurtful-TV-Crown-say-Kings-friends-Furious-John-Major-condemns-Netflix-drama.html">particularly annoyed</a> at it.</p>
<p>The show does admit to being fiction. But not knowing which bits are true makes it hard to know what to take from it. Though an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/12/crown-netflix-fact-fiction/617278/">article in the Atlantic</a> is probably right to conclude that &ldquo;the show is so popular that its interpretation of history will become the definitive one for millions of viewers.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b593116d-f948-4757-b2fa-c74adadc8b42">looks into why</a> the UK&rsquo;s NHS is in such a disastrous condition at present. It turns out it&rsquo;s not all that complicated to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently lots of ill people - a new wave of Covid-19 is once more sweeping the nation, and the flu (amongst other infectious diseases) is also surging. A real <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/30/ambulance-staff-reportedly-urged-to-conserve-oxygen-amid-twindemic">twindemic</a>.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t have enough hospital beds. This is partly because we haven&rsquo;t built enough capacity in the first place. But also because the lack of anywhere to discharge patients who still need some amount of social care (but not hospital-level care) to means that thousands of people are unnecessarily stuck in hospital.</li>
<li>There are not enough staff. All parts of the workforce have staff shortages. Those that are there are exhausted, demoralized and in recent times are occasionally on strike or leaving for better opportunities elsewhere. To be clear, these problems started way before the current spate of strikes were on the agenda.</li>
<li>There has not been enough investment. This is nothing new, it&rsquo;s been going on for at least a decade. NHS demand is constantly rising at present, so funding needs to rise substantially beyond inflation just to maintain performance. This hasn&rsquo;t happened for at least a decade.  The UK has amongst the lowest healthcare capital spending as % of GDP of it&rsquo;s peer countries, leaving us with fewer beds, MRI scanners, CT scanners and so on. The chart below, also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2154c20-c9d0-4209-9a47-95d114d31f2b">from the FT</a>, may provide a clue as to why.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/02/unlike-previous-generations.html">Unlike previous generations, UK and US millennials are not becoming more conservative over time</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/02/unlike-previous-generations.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-02 18:54:32 &#43;0000">Jan 2, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a widely held belief that younger people tend to start off being politically left-wing (or liberal, socialist, whatever one wants to call the axis). Then, as time goes on and they start to age, they end up with more conservative views and political preferences.</p>
<p>This trend is encapsulated in a maxim whose origin and exact wording <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/24/heart-head/">is much quibbled over</a> but often turns up in this sort of form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man who is not a Liberal at sixteen has no heart; a man who is not a Conservative at sixty has no head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I hope and trust the implied value judgement isn&rsquo;t true, otherwise, sorry, looks like I&rsquo;m just getting stupider as I get older.</p>
<p>But, treating it as purely descriptive of a trend, the idea that people tend to get more conservative when they get older <a href="https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-47910">does usually seem to be true</a>. Of course it isn&rsquo;t necessarily their age that causes these changes; it may be to do with the fact that people&rsquo;s wealth, status, position in life, psychology and so on tends to alter in an on-average predictable way as they get older.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c361e372-769e-45cd-a063-f5c0a7767cf4">John Burn-Murdoch of the FT notes</a> that it&rsquo;s just not happening that way for UK and US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Millennials">millennials</a>.</p>
<p>They started off liberal as other generations did. But now, even though the older ones are now 40+ years old, they&rsquo;re still very liberal, compared to the rest of the population at least.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/c1104cfbc6.jpg" width="600" height="389" alt="" />
<p>Why so? Burn-Murdoch hypothesises that this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_effect">cohort effect</a> due to British and US millennials entering adulthood during the aftermath of the financial crisis. They emerge into an economic environment where generating enough wealth to, for example, own a home is often a ludicrous pipe-dream.</p>
<p>The primary UK and US conservative party&rsquo;s respective fixation on culture war topics probably also doesn&rsquo;t help them much. The typical conservative side of the relevant arguments tends to be less attractive to more academically educated folk, and millennials are the best-educated generation at present.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad">Morten Støstad</a> produced <a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad/status/1609140065967509504">some follow-up work</a> that showed that this trend also exists elsewhere, particularly in English-speaking countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand. His <a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad/status/1609177462511902724">first chart</a> looks at English speaking countries and shows similar findings to Burn-Murdoch&rsquo;s original graph.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/d4ed9550a8.jpg" width="600" height="436" alt="" />
<p>In the second though, Støstad finds that in many other non-English-speaking countries, for example  Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the millennials do seem to be behaving &ldquo;as normal&rdquo; and becoming more conservative over time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/30/played-the-the.html">Exit advent calendar</a> was so good we couldn&rsquo;t stop. This one, from the same makers, is a one-session game where you attempt to solve puzzles to free yourself from an ancient Egyptian tomb. It&rsquo;s rated as one of the harder ones, perhaps because you need to figure out what the puzzles even are and which order to solve them in  as well as the puzzle solution itself - but we got there in the end.</p>

			 <p>Played the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/317434/exit-game-advent-calendar-mystery-ice-cave">The Mysterious Ice Cave advent calendar</a> from Exit: The Game 🎲.</p>
<p>This is an advent calendar that gives you a puzzle to solve each day of advent. The answer to each one tells you which door to open next in your attempt to escape from a catastrophic mountain avalanche.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/41781672e8.png" width="300" alt="" />
<p>We actually ignored the entire premise and completed it over two lengthy sessions. The puzzles were fun and varied, some harder than others but most of them felt very fair.</p>
<p>Something happens towards the end that was one of my favourite ever twists in these kind of games. Even more fun than a chocolate calendar for anyone that likes puzzle escape room kind of things, highly recommended.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/28/covid-mrna-vaccines.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-28 15:05:51 &#43;0000">Dec 28, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2798866">A recent paper</a> provides a systematic review of studies on the link between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations and myopericarditis in young people.</p>
<p>They find that there&rsquo;s a low but positive association between the vaccination and later myopericarditis, particularly in males after the second dose of the vaccine. The ovreall rate of developing myopericarditis after vaccination is estimated to be between 0.3 and 5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated people.</p>
<p>But - and this is a huge but - this risk is <em>far lower</em> than the risk of developing the same condition after being infected by Covid-19 itself.</p>
<p>So whilst it&rsquo;s important and true that there is a risk of myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines (and no conspiracy theorists, no-one sensible is covering this up - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-information-for-healthcare-professionals/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-covid-19-vaccination#is-there-an-association-of-myocarditis-or-pericarditis-following-covid-19-vaccination">here</a> for example is the UK government&rsquo;s published advice on this matter) when making our decisions we need to remember that you&rsquo;re more than 3x more likely to get myocarditis if you&rsquo;re infected by Covid as opposed to if you take the vaccine and it prevents you getting Covid.</p>
<p>The authors also find that the severity of outcomes associated with developing myopericarditis was lower if it was associated with having developed after vaccination vs if it had developed following Covid-19.  No-one in any of the surveyed studies</p>
<p>To me, this is all about considering which the correct baselines are for any given decision. Vaccines are not entirely risk free. But given <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/covid-news-anyone-not-caught-it-england_uk_62727dc1e4b0cca6755cc13d">almost everyone in the UK</a> appears to have had Covid-19 at some point and it continues to circulate nearly 2 years later, it is usually more sensible for the average person not literally living in a bubble to compare the risks associated with the vaccine to the risks associated with getting Covid, rather than some fantasy lifestyle where there is no risk to <em>not</em> having the vaccine.</p>
<p>In summary: I believe this study suggests taking the vaccine makes it more than 3x less likely you&rsquo;d suffer myopericarditis if you got the vaccine as opposed to getting Covid. Furthermore if you do contract it post-vaccination, it&rsquo;s less likely to be severe than if it followed Covid. However it is slightly more likely that you&rsquo;d develop it than if you went through life having never had either the vaccine or Covid-19.</p>

The Taliban administration said yes, sure, of course, we&rsquo;ll respect women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>In reality, so far the women of Afghanistan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-education-taliban-7583cf97e3d96e0d07cd7674c3b5a3c3">have been banned</a> from attending middle school, high school, universities or certain types of religious classes. They&rsquo;re also prohibited from most forms of employment. They can&rsquo;t visit parks or gyms, and are obligated to wear full-coverage clothing in other public areas. There&rsquo;s a concern this is a dismal journey towards even more absolute rights-stripping, such that Afghan women may soon be prohibited from leaving their homes more generally.</p>

			 <p>One of the drivers of the huge number of strikes the UK <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/05/an-understandable-epidemic.html">is currently in the midst of</a> is that many employers are not offering annual pay rises that allow for a wage it&rsquo;s possible to live a decent life on, let alone keep up spending parity with last year. Pay is not the only reason for the strikes by a long stretch, but it is a key one for many strikes.</p>
<p>One argument the government often respond to the public service sector strikers' pay demands with is &ldquo;Hey, we don&rsquo;t set the wages, we just do what the independent Pay Review boards tell us to do. Blame them!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The role of Pay Review Boards is to give advice to the government on pay for certain public sector workers. They cover <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/public-sector-pay">about 45%</a> of all public sector staff. The boards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Armed forces’ pay review body (AFPRB) </li>
<li>National Crime Agency remuneration review body (NCARRB)</li>
<li>NHS pay review body (NHSPRB)</li>
<li>Police remuneration review body (PRRB) </li>
<li>Prison service pay review body (PSPRB)</li>
<li>Review body on doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration (DDRB)</li>
<li>Review body on senior salaries (SSRB)</li>
<li>School teachers’ review body (STRB) </li>
</ul>
<p>One immediate critique of the government&rsquo;s claim that any disagreement is all the Pay Review Board&rsquo;s fault is that governments don&rsquo;t actually have to implement the board&rsquo;s recommendations. Their output is advice that in theory the government can do what it likes with.</p>
<p>Whilst the norm is to follow the advice, it&rsquo;s easy to find examples of where they haven&rsquo;t. For instance the latest advice from the Prison Service Pay Review Body and Senior Salaries Review Body were <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/pay-review-bodies">only partially accepted</a>. The Government has the final say so could alter the parameters if it wanted to.</p>
<p>But perhaps more problematic is that the government can exert a lot of influence over what the advice is going to be in the first place, to a level I wasn&rsquo;t really aware of until recently.</p>
<p>For a start it&rsquo;s the government who appoints each of the board members in the first place, with the Prime Minister being responsible for appointing the chair. But we don&rsquo;t need to get into the realms of the personal to see how constrained the boards are.</p>
<p>Each year the relevant government minister sends a remit to the board concerned, alongside their the pay changes the government already decided it wants to make.  The remit tells the board which factors they should focus on when making their decisions alongside any constraints that the government <em>has already decided to enforce</em> that they must bear in mind.</p>
<p>Sometimes the constraints are such that they exclude many of decisions the board in theory could make.</p>
<p>For instance, between 2013 and 2017 the public sector pay growth was limited to an average of 1%. The constraint was imposed by the government, not the pay review board. In situations like these the boards can only give advice on <em>how</em> to distribute that 1%.</p>
<p>Likewise during 2021-2022 there was a general public sector pay freeze ordered by the government for most public sector employees. The pay review boards could then only give advice on how to implement rises for types of workers the government had decided were eligible.</p>
<p>This year the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024-pay-round">NHS remit letter</a> tells the board that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the NHS budget has already been set until 2024 to 2025. Pay awards must strike a careful balance – recognising the vital importance of public sector workers while delivering value for the taxpayer, considering private sector pay levels, not increasing the country’s debt further, and being careful not to drive prices even higher in the future.</p>
<p>In the current economic context, it is particularly important that you also have regard to the government’s inflation target when forming recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the board is constrained to giving advice that if enacted wouldn&rsquo;t increase the amount of budget the NHS would need to fulfill it. They&rsquo;d also probably want to avoid using up enough of the pre-decided budget such that another aspect of the investment-starved service would suffer even more than it already is. The latter is something that can easily happen - there are many reports of, for example, the pressure schools are under to give their staff pay rises the government agreed to, but with the government failing to actually providing the extra budget needed to enact the raise. Thus some other critical part of the educational experience in this case must suffer.</p>
<p>The NHS remit letter this year also tells the board to ensure that their advice somehow focuses on the inflation target that the government set, rather than, say, what&rsquo;s necessary for a happy, efficient, effective workforce.</p>
<p>This feels entirely backwards to me, and sometimes potentially impossible. How does one take the government&rsquo;s inflation target into consideration at the same time as considering private sector pay levels,  when the private sector is not constrained to take any note at all of the government&rsquo;s inflation target in making its pay awards?</p>
<p>Naively, I had expected that the pay review board created its recommendations based on the need to recruit, retain and engage employees in the domain that they&rsquo;re responsible for. They&rsquo;d ensure that the employees have enough income to live a reasonable life, and ideally have pay roughly comparable to other similar job opportunities out there. Except of course if we&rsquo;re  particularly desperate to recruit and retain some roles (which we are - we&rsquo;re desperate for nurses and teachers amongst others), in which case perhaps the pay or conditions would have to be improved to reflect that.</p>
<p>In this fantasy world, the board&rsquo;s recommendations would then give input to the government to help them to figure out what budget they need to provide in order to fulfill the pay recommendations, in addition to any other investments or costs the service in question needs outside of the domain of the Pay Review Board. But in reality it looks to be more the other way around. The government can pre-set the budget and enforce constraints of its own choosing. The boards seem to be more advising on how to implement the government&rsquo;s existing plans rather than enabled to provide an independent opinion as to what those plans should be in the first place.</p>

			 <p>The recent <a href="https://www.qatar2022.qa/">Qatar World Cup</a> final was apparently one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">best ever matches</a> to grace the competition, although sadly I forgot it was even on.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the surrounding setup was anything other than a moral disaster.</p>
<p>Described by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/19/the-winner-is-qatar-project-hard-football-power-world-cup-2022">the Guardian&rsquo;s Barney Ronay</a> as &lsquo;the most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport&rsquo;, the honour of hosting it was granted to an authoritarian government that routinely enables the abuse of human rights.</p>
<p>There are essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar">no LGBT rights</a> in Qatar, with prison sentences handed out for engaging in &ldquo;homosexual practices&rdquo;. Even <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/24/qatar-security-forces-arrest-abuse-lgbt-people">just existing</a> can lead to imprisonment, beating and harassment from the security forces. Anti LGBT legislation was followed to the almost-comical-if-it-wasn&rsquo;t-real extent that <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1707227/Qatar-officials-slammed-crazy-rainbow-flag-ban-gay-player-World-Cup-news">you weren&rsquo;t allowed to wear</a> rainbow coloured clothes to the match.</p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s multiple new stadiums and surrounding infrastructure were built in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022">literally deadly</a> workplace conditions involving <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/qatar-world-cup-labor-modern-slavery-new-report_n_636d2e72e4b03438614132ba">near slavery</a> in many instances.</p>
<p>The environmental damage is also likely to be <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-cup-in-qatar-is-a-climate-catastrophe/">absurdly huge</a>, despite the incredible amount of greenwashing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly upsetting to reflect on the point that perhaps all this isn&rsquo;t a weird aberration. The fact Qatar was selected as the host made the associated horror show particularly visible and disturbing. But, unfortunately, abusing desperate humans alongside the climate that sustains us all in order to put on a massively profitable and image-enhancing show is far more universal than that.</p>
<p>Back to Ronay&rsquo;s article :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qatar didn’t invent this world, didn’t invent migrant labour, didn’t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole event has the same ethos of &ldquo;hardcore capitalism eating itself&rdquo; that most cryptocurrency efforts to date often inspire in me. With that technology we <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18686-8">burn the planet </a>in order to enforce artificial scarcity over a made-up construct with the predictable outcome of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-s-inequality-problem-is-putting-the-dollar-to-s-1848248393">further exacerbating</a> chronic wealth inequality.</p>

We&rsquo;re often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don&rsquo;t step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it.</p>
<p>In the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&amp;author=Alex+Iantaffi&amp;cover_id=32801">Life Isn&rsquo;t Binary</a>, Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pain and struggles are entirely real, there&rsquo;s no questioning of that. But in many cases they&rsquo;re also understandable without recourse to individual &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;. They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&amp;author=Johann+Hari&amp;cover_id=32781">Lost Connections</a>, Hari notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved responses to dangers that may not be &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for today&rsquo;s challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They&rsquo;re a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat.</p>
<p>In some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.</p>
<p>As is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I&rsquo;ve read in recent times. But it&rsquo;s not clear to me that it&rsquo;s reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people&rsquo;s very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.</p>
<p>A quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Human Nature&rsquo;, which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capacity to become depressed&hellip;is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth&hellip;the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I&rsquo;m aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it&rsquo;s often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they&rsquo;re of &ldquo;bad character&rdquo; (whatever that means) or that they&rsquo;re somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he&rsquo;s only <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html">second richest</a> now)?</p>
<p>If we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn&rsquo;t we find it strange if they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you&rsquo;re suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it&rsquo;s a perfect normal phenomenon. You don&rsquo;t need treatment. There&rsquo;s nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw.</p>
<p>But very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.</p>
<p>By many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645">The Better Angels of our Nature</a>&rdquo; as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it&rsquo;s very often a fallacy to think &ldquo;things must have been better in every way a few decades ago&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we&rsquo;d be guaranteed happiness&rdquo;.   But even if the direction <em>has</em> generally been positive in the past, then there&rsquo;s no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way.</p>
<p>But the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think &ldquo;oh man, that&rsquo;s wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe <em>that</em> was OK?&rdquo; about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today&rsquo;s standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.</p>
<p>But another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from <em>not</em> taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> manner of addressing their pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let&rsquo;s say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical &ldquo;brain treatment&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so.</p>
<p>Most damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out.</p>
<p>As just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/">highly associated</a> with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently">was apparently almost eliminated </a>and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation.</p>
<p>It seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318">end the scheme</a>. Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_">back to having no accommodation</a> It&rsquo;s feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis">tidal wave</a>&rdquo; of new homelessness, and given the <a href="https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society">acknowledged connection</a> between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html">New York Times opinion article</a> provided the following metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If something about some people&rsquo;s lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn&rsquo;t also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.</p>
<p>Therapising someone who&rsquo;s anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don&rsquo;t have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else&rsquo;s whim. Someone who didn&rsquo;t respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me.</p>
<p>If their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness">feel like they have no friends</a>? A society where financial security depends in part <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/">upon your race</a>? That those who live in some areas <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492">die many years earlier</a> than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand</a>?</p>
<p>This becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&amp;author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&amp;cover_id=32791">The Body Keeps The Score,</a> the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven&rsquo;t fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.</p>
<p>In her book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942">All Our Relations</a>, Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in.</p>
<p>She reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system">Indian Residential schools</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn&rsquo;t suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.</p>
<p>Today Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.</p>
<p>A related critique of the &ldquo;DSM-5&rdquo; type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in <a href="https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf">their response</a> to the development of the that system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.
This misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all this I want to remember that it&rsquo;s very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn&rsquo;t due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts.</p>
<p>A categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you.</p>
<p>Despite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/">especially for rarer conditions</a>. In 2016, Naslund et al. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like &ldquo;they are their illness&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can&rsquo;t help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - &ldquo;given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks&rdquo;, to quote the Naslund paper.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues.</p>
<p>Recently the results of a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">National Health Service</a> intervention that involved the prescribing of heating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689">reported success</a>. &ldquo;Prescribing heating&rdquo; simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs"> dramatic increase in energy costs</a> in recent times.</p>
<p>Many illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It&rsquo;s estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS £860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but <a href="https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf">the report that calculated the £860 million figure</a> does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.</p>
<p>In 2018 we saw a &ldquo;social prescribing&rdquo; initiative that would enable doctors <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/">to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments</a> for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf">anti-loneliness strategy</a>.</p>
<p>The NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/">wide range of people</a>, including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing">reporting</a>) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>Of course, as with almost anything, there&rsquo;s a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being &ldquo;socially-prescribed&rdquo; to on the basis that it&rsquo;s a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don&rsquo;t know).</p>
<p>It will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf">for patients with mild mental illnesses</a>. For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.</p>
<p>Social prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.</p>
<p>Many, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you&rsquo;re already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace.</p>
<p>One example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/">Trussell Trust,</a> who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf">a report</a> by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>Intuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can&rsquo;t do a lot for the person&rsquo;s ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>In the words of the Big Issue&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/">writeup of the report</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a &lsquo;toxic environment&rsquo; for their mental health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report">A third</a> of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016">I, Daniel Blake</a>&rdquo; portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607">There are certainly people</a> who don&rsquo;t seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed">polling</a> showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of £10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf">the Government report</a> correctly.</p>
<p>As it stands, <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/">one study</a> found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants.</p>
<p>With all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven&rsquo;t looked much into work in this area.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://covidrealities.org/">Covid Realities project</a> did however find instances of people describing the latter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; improve the former.</p>
<p>For those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by £20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients.</p>
<p>This £20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609">chose to abolish</a> even that £20 increase.</p>
<p>Many experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/">Mental Health UK</a>, who <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217">highlighted the dangerous loop effect</a> between mental health and poverty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not just a financial issue; we’re very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/">British Psychological Society</a> had similar concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people&rsquo;s lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way.</p>
<p>There are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in.</p>
<p>But however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.</p>

<figcaption>Monokuma, from the <a href = "https://danganronpa.fandom.com/wiki/Danganronpa_Wiki">Danganronpa wiki</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A visual novel style game where you&rsquo;re trapped in a school under the purview of a tyrannical teddy bear. He&rsquo;s happy to let you &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;, but only if you first murder one of your friends in such a way that the rest never suspect you. And nobody wants to do something like that, right?</p>
<p>The main action consists of a series of trials whereupon you need to destroy the testimony of your friends/rivals by literally firing &ldquo;truth bullets&rdquo; at their invalid statements, in between a few somewhat inexplicable bouts of hangman and rhythm games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havoc&rdquo; is a good subtitle for it; it&rsquo;s pretty insane and chaotic. But the story is gripping and addictive. The twists and turns you learn throughout the trials are high-tier detective drama-like at times. If you are OK with a lot of reading, and some high-school drama, it comes highly recommended, albeit with one caveat.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc-anniversary-edition">others have noted</a>, it includes plenty of aspects that these days might be considered crass or problematic - enough to make me inwardly cringe now and then - so buyer beware. It&rsquo;s definitely not one for children.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/">UK Statistics Authority</a> has once again been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/12/watchdog-reprimands-tories-over-800bn-post-brexit-trade-deals-claim">forced to reprimand</a> the Conservative party for making false claims with data.</p>
<p>This time we&rsquo;d seen Michael Gove <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1587812825304645635">claiming</a> that the UK had gotten over £800 billion worth of new trade since 2016 due to securing new free trade deals post-Brexit.</p>
<p>The thing is the £800 billion figure <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/post-Brexit-trade-deals-Gove/">reflects <em>total</em> trade</a> with these countries since 2016, not new trade. And for the vast majority of countries concerned the equivalent of these trade deals existed long before 2016; the terms and conditions were just <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842">rolled over</a> post-Brexit, making it entirely misleading to imply that they caused new trade.</p>
<p>Even were this not to be the case, one cannot attribute all trade with a country to having a free trade agreement with them. As a country, the US is one of the UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/october2022">top trade partners</a> by value, despite us <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-admits-us-trade-deal-out-of-reach/">being nowhere near close</a> to forming a free trade agreement with them.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363736651_Your_Consent_Is_Worth_75_Euros_A_Year_--_Measurement_and_Lawfulness_of_Cookie_Paywalls">Morel et al. write about</a> a new-to-me website phenomenon I&rsquo;ve not come across yet - &lsquo;cookie paywalls&rsquo;. These are sites whereby to access the content you can choose to either have your behaviour tracked by the site or alternatively you can pay money to use the site without being tracked.</p>
<p>Given how much <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/gdpr-cookie-consent-eprivacy">everyone hates</a> the EU cookie popups  I don&rsquo;t think introducing more such barriers before being able to access a site going to cause much delight.</p>
<p>Although I guess I do like that it makes explicit firstly that you&rsquo;re being tracked - which you probably are being on most other major sites anyway, and the vast majority are not so clear on that. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/11/google-is-tracking-you-on-86-of-the-top-50000-websites-on-the-planet/">One study</a> from 2020 suggested that Google alone is tracking website visitors on 86% of the top 50,000 website. And secondly that the data being silently collected from you has some monetary value. A cookie paywall gives you the choice of how you want the website to extract value from you - pay with money or pay with data.</p>
<p>I was also interested to learn the amount typically charged for opting out of such tracking at present. In the examples the paper surveyed it ranged between 2.99 and 6.25 euros per month. Honestly I can&rsquo;t see all that many people taking the imposition and <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites">risks</a> of being tracked seriously enough to pay that kind of amount, particularly if it&rsquo;s something you have to set up on each individual website you visit. It&rsquo;s also hard for me to imagine that most people&rsquo;s behaviour data on most sites is truly &ldquo;worth&rdquo; 75 euros a year.</p>

Just share it via the share sheet to Kindle and it&rsquo;ll allow you to either add it to your library or send it to a specific device.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/82ee04ca9f.png" />
<p>There&rsquo;s still reasons you might want to use other apps to do this- for example the <a href="https://hq.getmatter.app/">Matter reader app</a> allows you to consolidate many articles into a nicely arranged Kindle &lsquo;book&rsquo;. But the basic share feature is great for a one off articles (including webpages, ePubs, PDFs or Word files) or if using apps that don&rsquo;t provide this facility.</p>

Retro-ish indie, with lyrics delivered with appropriate levels of deadpan absurdity and irony by a couple of college friends who apparently decided to form a band on a whim whilst drunk <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-59696208">on the top of a Ferris Wheel</a>. I&rsquo;m very happy they did.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m slightly amused that the AI-driven <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT chat bot</a> has been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaem/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt-for-constantly-giving-wrong-answers">banned</a> from being used to write <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> answers.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, StackOverflow is a web forum where programmer and programmer-adjacent nerds like me ask questions about how to do various technical tasks so we look like we&rsquo;re extremely proficient in our jobs.</p>
<p>chatGPT responses are prohibited on the basis that it sometimes produces answers that are surface-level plausible but in fact wrong. The problem is that it would take a human with expertise to know that the answers are wrong. Or &ldquo;fluent bullshit&rdquo; to quote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23493932/chatgpt-ai-generated-answers-temporarily-banned-stack-overflow-llms-dangers">a Verge article</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;d observe that humans on the internet are <em>extremely</em> not immune from producing reams of fluent bullshit, so perhaps it&rsquo;s just a bad habit it picked up from us.</p>
<p>Other than that, chatGPT is a pretty incredible seeming system at first glance. You can sign up to try it for free <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">here</a> at present, which is well worth doing if you have even a slight interest. As it happens it has actually given me some useful answers to technical questions, as well as a lot of facility for wasting time.</p>

<p>The conceit here is that you&rsquo;re listening to a radio station on the way to the afterlife, full of relatively upbeat (for him) electro-pop with radio jingle-esque narrations here and there by Jim Carrey no less.</p>
<p>The review consensus seems to be that Less Than Zero is the best track, but I also liked this disco-pop-house entry.</p>

<p>At some point in my youth it felt like there were a ton of pop-punkish songs about how much the performer concerned was in always-unrequited love with &ldquo;emo girls&rdquo;, how they take a ton of drugs, how generally alienated and nihilistic they&rsquo;re feeling, all that kind of stuff. The latest Machine Gun Kelly brings back those vibes big time.</p>
<p>Something about it would make me cringe if I was to find out it&rsquo;s intended as entirely sincere rather than a slightly tongue-in-check callback to those times. But that aside, I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying it as a retro listen.</p>
<p>I mean, this isn&rsquo;t exactly lacking in cheesy clichés, but it&rsquo;s also pretty catchy.</p>

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/05/an-understandable-epidemic.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-05 12:38:52 &#43;0000">Dec 5, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The UK is currently experiencing a whole lot of strikes. There&rsquo;s at least one a day <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11494349/The-12-strikes-Christmas-Walkouts-hit-UK-day-festive-period.html">from now to Christmas</a>. They <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62134314">include</a> unprecedented planned walkouts by nurses, paramedics, ambulance services, railway workers, post handlers, people who work in the education sector, airline workers and dock workers amongst others.</p>
<p>Most seem to be driven by pay offers that are substantially below inflation, which poses real problems when many people are already in the midst of a <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cost-living-crisis">cost of living crisis</a>. There&rsquo;s also increasingly arduous and impossible working conditions in some roles, often exacerbated by there being far too many unfilled vacancies for a safe and efficient service to be offered.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s nice to see is that despite the best attempts of the Government, and some parts of the media, to blame the strikers for being greedy, lazy or whatever - the most high-profile unhinged attack perhaps being the chairman of the Conservatives claiming that the people going on strike <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/vladimir-putin-wants-nhs-nurses-to-go-on-strike-says-conservative-party-chairman_uk_638c7095e4b07530543af20b">are supporting Putin</a> -  recent surveys suggest that a higher proportion of the public are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/04/december-of-discontent-will-strikers-or-government-and-management-take-the-blame">generally on the side of the strikers</a> rather than the management or government.</p>
<p>Most of the strikes I&rsquo;ve heard about are in the public sector, but more private interests are not wholly exempt. Perhaps the most dystopian one I&rsquo;ve read about so far is that employees of the homelessness charity <a href="https://www.shelter.org.uk/">Shelter</a> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/05/homelessness-charity-shelter-staff-start-unprecedented-two-week-strike">contemplating having to go on strike</a> on the basis that their current pay offer may result in they themselves ending up homeless, being unable to afford their own living accommodation.</p>
<p>One common riposte of the government is that &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t possibly pay essential civil servants cost of living increases because it&rsquo;ll make inflation go even higher&rdquo;. One thing I&rsquo;ve never understood in these sorts of arguments is why, if they really believe that to be true, they continuously hold back the pay of public servants but yet never seem to legislate for - or even advise -  private businesses to do the same.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I do understand it; it would probably cause an outcry amongst a certain amount of the public, and be absolute anathema to especially the Truss contingent of the Conservative party. But in theory this to me would be a more consistent form of same idea, even if I would most likely be opposed to it in the same way that I&rsquo;m opposed to making our public servants even poorer. I&rsquo;m open to arguments why this isn&rsquo;t the case though, it&rsquo;s certainly not my area of expertise.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, it&rsquo;s not like the government doesn&rsquo;t <em>already</em> exert control over the rates of pay private businesses can offer. Two contemporary examples include <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/national-minimum-wage-entitlement">minimum wage legislation</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/15/what-is-the-banker-bonus-cap-and-could-scrapping-it-boost-growth">the cap on banker&rsquo;s bonuses</a>.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780575114968">The Prestige</a> by Christopher Priest 📚.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this part science-fiction, part gothic horror, tale. Most of the story is presented as diary entries from two 19th century magicians who become obsessed with competing with each other, sabotaging each other&rsquo;s tricks whilst fervently trying to understand and outperform each other&rsquo;s best illusions at any cost. The cost turns out to be quite significant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous enough Christopher Nolan <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-prestige-2006">film of the book</a>. In some ways it&rsquo;s presented quite differently and, from memory, it totally misses out the book&rsquo;s start and end. But it has basically the same main reveal. So the novel&rsquo;s twists and turns may have had even more impact had I not seen that first. But it was still an enthralling and gripping read, worth it even if you saw the film.</p>

<p>A good introduction to structural equation modelling, a statistical technique designed to investigate how a set of observed variables and/or an implied construct may causally relate to each other.</p>

<img src="uploads/2022/3faaa5e881.png" width="600" height="356" alt="" />
<p>This book is as clear an intro as I can imagine there is, although some of the later more advanced topics I admit I rather glossed over. It seems the sort of approach you can likely only master by doing, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying out some of the techniques for real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a useful refresher on regression and factor analysis, those being components of many SEMs, for anyone looking to remind themselves what those practices all about.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring is a key component of standard treatments for obesity. Using digital tools, as opposed to paper-based monitoring, may reduce some of the obstacles faced when someone tries to do this, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They may reduce the time it takes to track one&rsquo;s diet, e.g. with nutrition databases that automatically populate nutrition info, or features that suggest entries.</li>
<li>Wearable technologies allow for passive rather than active monitoring.</li>
<li>We may be able to raise engagement levels via individualised feedback and prompts.</li>
<li>Phones are very portable meaning that monitoring can be done in real time wherever you are, rather than retrospectively.</li>
<li>They may reduce numeracy and health literacy barriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper reviews 39 randomised controlled trials published between 2009 and 2019 which:</p>
<ul>
<li>featured interventions designed to aid weight loss for participants with overweight or obesity.</li>
<li>involved the use of digital tracking tools.</li>
<li>had  interventions that lasted at least 12 weeks and included outcomes around self-monitoring engagement and a weight loss outcome from at least 6 months after enrollment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its primary aim is to determine whether digital self-monitoring is associated with weight loss. Secondarily, it looks to understand the types of digital methods used for self-monitoring and their engagement rates in the associated interventions.</p>
<p>Of the 67 interventions involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>72% of them involved self-monitoring of weight.</li>
<li>81% involved self-monitoring of dietary intake. Mostly this involved tracking food intake or calories.</li>
<li>82% involved self-monitoring of physical activity. Mostly this meant tracking the durations of physical activity, but sometimes it was step count, types of exercises or other related items.</li>
<li>7% self-monitored specific behaviour change goals.</li>
<li>54% included monitoring all of weight, dietary intake and activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most commonly this was done via a website (66% of treatment arms), with a lower number using mobile apps (33%), wearable devices (16%), electronic scales (12%) and text messaging (12%), PDAs (3%) or IVR technology (3%). In several cases participants were given a choice as to which method they preferred.</p>
<p>Some interventions used commercial websites or apps, others used websites specific to the study.</p>
<p>Only 9% of interventions that recommended daily digital self-monitoring engagement saw participants engage for at least 75% of the days concerned.  58% of arms saw engagements for at least half of the recommended days.</p>
<ul>
<li>These numbers are higher in shorter interventions and vice versa.</li>
<li>Engagement was highest when the intervention involved self-monitoring weight. The rate was somewhat lower for diet monitoring, and lower yet for physical activity. This may be confounded by differences in the frequency prescribed the opportunities to to record.</li>
<li>Engagement was typically higher with digital as opposed to paper-based monitoring.</li>
<li>The addition of counselling usually didn&rsquo;t increase the engagement rate.</li>
<li>Passive self-monitoring behaviours (e.g. wearable devices) had higher engagement rates than active self-monitoring methods, although one study showed that passive weight tracking was less associated with weight loss, perhaps because it doesn&rsquo;t promote awareness of one&rsquo;s behaviour as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some studies compared engagement outcomes between monitoring modalities. Factors that were associated with engagement when comparison were possible include the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>incentives.</li>
<li>enhancements.</li>
<li>a wearable device.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a positive association between high levels of digital self-monitoring and increased weight loss in 74% of cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rates didn&rsquo;t differ much based on what was monitored, with the exception that of the 3 studies that involved monitoring behaviour change goals only 1 showed an association with weight loss.</li>
<li>Interventions that lasted at least 12 months were less likely to show an association than those that were shorter. This may either be because of rates self-monitoring engagement or weight loss declining over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>One limitation of these studies is that participants were never randomised to different levels of self-monitoring; thus high frequency monitors are self-selected and may differ from each other in other ways.</p>
<p>Researchers should use strategies such as the multiphase optimisation strategy to understand the different impact of different self-monitoring strategies.</p>
<p>Research into how to prevent the decline in self-monitoring engagement over time is needed, as well as understanding the predictors and moderators of self-monitoring engagements. Personalisation may be needed; some people may succeed more on one self-monitoring approach than others.</p>
<p>In the mean time adults with overweight or obesity should be encouraged to self-monitor frequently when undergoing interventions that are aimed at weight loss.</p>

			 <p>The 2021 England and Wales census results are <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census">out now</a>. Most headlines are focussing on the fact that this is the first time that less than 50% of our country now identifies as Christian. It&rsquo;s dropped 13 percentage points vs the 2011 census and now sits at 46%.</p>
<p>Some are finding this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/29/calls-grow-to-disestablish-church-of-england-as-christians-become-minority">particularly noteworthy</a> in a country where the head of state - King Charles -  is also the head of the Church of England, officially the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/defender-of-the-faith">Defender of the Faith</a>&rdquo;.  26 Church of England bishops <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/bishops/">hold power</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords">House of Lords</a> - the so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a>&rdquo;. In theory state schools <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/281929/Collective_worship_in_schools.pdf">are required </a>to hold daily acts of Christian worship, although many in reality <a href="https://religionmediacentre.org.uk/factsheets/collective-worship-in-england-and-wales/">do not</a> and suffer no consequences.</p>

</figure>
<p>The vast majority of the difference is explained by an increasing number of people declaring that they do not follow any religion. That&rsquo;s <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/29/uk/england-wales-christianity-census-intl/index.html">increased by 12 percentage points </a>compared to 10 years ago and currently sits at 37% of the country; around 22 million people.</p>
<p>In terms of percentage growth rates, some of the smaller &ldquo;religions&rdquo; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/29/ten-things-weve-learned-from-the-england-and-wales-census">top the leaderboard</a> - although of course there&rsquo;s a lot more room to grow by incredible sounding rates when you start from a very small number. Devotees of Shamanism have increased from 650 people ten years ago to 8,000 now. Pagans increased from 57,000 to 74,000, and there are now 13,000 folk identifying as Wiccan.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/29/some-elon-musk.html">Some Elon Musk Twitter takeover miscellany</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/29/some-elon-musk.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-29 12:22:29 &#43;0000">Nov 29, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the excoriating misery that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">&ldquo;Elon Musk bought Twitter&rdquo;</a> discourse - an institution which has disproven any sense we had between 2016 and 2021 that it couldn&rsquo;t really get much worse - there have been a couple of brighter spots I&rsquo;ve appreciated.</p>
<p>Firstly I often ponder about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect">power of defaults</a>. I&rsquo;d wonder about what would happen if society ever decided to reverse some of the more ingrained ones. For example, what if if each month the norm was that you actively <em>opted in</em> to your job if you were happy to keep it, rather than the more conventional awkward and emotional opt out scenario.</p>
<p>Another big one is my eternal curiosity about what would happen if the threat of immediate poverty wasn&rsquo;t there. That might reduce the incentive to stay with your current employer, however unsatisfactory they are, purely on the basis that they&rsquo;re slightly less dreadful than the prospective life of penury might be.</p>
<p>Happily Elon managed to address both at the same time. He <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23464178/elon-musk-twitter-employees-ultimatum-severance-agreement-faq-document">emailed all Twitter employees</a> to let them know that they had to click on a link if they wanted to keep their job; very much an opt-in workflow. Let&rsquo;s hope that by some magical force everyone read and understood the email by the deadline. Also this is likely illegal in many countries Twitter has employees in, but, you know, Elon.</p>
<p>He also seemed to offer 3 months pay, no questions asked, for those that didn&rsquo;t want to opt in. Additionally, this is a company where many folk were likely well-paid enough to have some savings (citation needed I accept). Those who held any Twitter stock might in fact be richer than they&rsquo;d ever been before given how much above market value Elon was forced to buy the company for.</p>
<p>I should note that it&rsquo;s not all upside; I dare say many of the staff weren&rsquo;t in a particularly privileged position - the company did not survive on elite coders alone. I also felt especially sorry for people on the kind of foreign visas that require you to keep working or be deported, not least because he&rsquo;d fired half the company even before he got to this point.</p>
<p>The consequence? Well, it seems like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-elon-musk-half-working-2022-11">thousands of employees</a> - more than half of Twitter&rsquo;s entire staff - decided to take the offer and quit. Whole departments in some cases.</p>
<p>Of course this particular situation is very confounded by having the knowledge that if you choose to stay then you do so in the knowledge that your new boss will be something of an egomaniac madman who not only goes to sleep next to an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-bedside-table-picture-guns-books-coke-buddhist-object-2022-11">unsettling display of mostly Americana</a> each night but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462026/elon-musk-twitter-email-hardcore-or-severance">made it very clear</a> that you will have to sacrifice all other aspects of your life so you can do &lsquo;extremely hardcore&rsquo; work and be subjected to his fire-at-will tantrums. So I suppose to answer my underlying questions I&rsquo;d really need to wait for a more natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment">natural experiment</a>.</p>
<p>The other entertaining thing was when Elon chose to make one of the most consequential and controversial social media moderation decisions of the recent era - whether to allow Donald Trump back in - via, of course, an unconstrained <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985">Twitter poll</a>. It gave him the result I imagine he wanted, albeit only by the same kind of margin as the Brexit referendum <a href="https://theconversation.com/leave-wins-uk-brexit-referendum-52-48-61428">ended up having</a> - many of us Britons cannot see the numbers 52 and 48 next to each other without a slight flash of anxiety.</p>
<p>He then reinstated the Trump account together with <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777">a declaration in Latin</a> - &ldquo;Vox Populi, Vox Dei&rdquo; that in its original context means the virtually the opposite of what I imagine he was aiming to project. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_populi#Vox_populi,_vox_Dei">Translating</a> to something like &ldquo;The voice of the people is the voice of God&rdquo;, the <a href="https://www.historynet.com/what-is-the-history-of-vox-populi-vox-dei/">earliest known usage</a> of that fragment  was around the year 800 in a sentence which in fact reads as  &ldquo;&hellip;those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always close to insanity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the subject of &ldquo;close to insanity&rdquo;, in any case Trump was all &lsquo;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-twitter-poll-showing-narrow-majority-want-trump-reinstated-2022-11-20/">no thanks, not interested</a>&rsquo;. I first assumed this was because he was either in a huff that he was subject to the whims of another dangerous weird billionaire, or too busy coming up with some semi-illegal scheme to keep on reducing the voteshare that the US Republicans get by virtue of being their presidential nominee.</p>
<p>But now I understand that he&rsquo;s just literally <em>not allowed</em> to tweet in his usual style as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/trump-twitter-return-truth-social">his contract</a> with his current maelstrom of a social network - possibly the most incorrectly named site on the internet - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social">Truth Social</a>. Not to say he won&rsquo;t break the contract; he has of course plenty of form conducting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/28/12904136/donald-trump-corrupt">unethical and likely illegal business practices</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, that&rsquo;s more than enough on that subject. Honestly I have wasted a lot more time reading about Musk and Twitter in recent times than I should have. But then again I have heard <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/the-fraudulent-king">this article</a> is good&hellip;must resist, must resist.</p>

			 <p>Finished playing <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> 🎮.</p>
<p>This game created something of a sensation when it came out 6 years ago. I&rsquo;d no doubt it was good but I&rsquo;d understood it to be a time consuming open-world adventure so figured it wouldn&rsquo;t work well for my typical adult life 20 minute-ish gaming sessions. However it turns out that I did find it extremely worthy of all the game of the year awards it won so I&rsquo;m very glad I gave it a go. It is in fact really great, and you can definitely play it in shortish bursts if you have to (and have the willpower to turn it off).</p>
<figure>
<img src="uploads/2022/fecb420638.png" width="600" height="337" alt="" />
<figcaption>A screenshot of the game, courtesy of <a href = "https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/04/36-gorgeous-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-screenshots">IGN</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It tells the story of Link, who awakens with no memory of the past but is nonetheless thrust on a mission to save the land of Hyrule from the evil forces of Ganon.</p>
<p>My fear of its open-world nature meaning that typically I&rsquo;d find myself wandering around lost for ages not knowing what to do was entirely alleviated by the facts that both 1) the game makes it pretty obvious what your potential next steps are, and 2) the world is so delightful, in how it looks and how it works, that for the first time I was very happy to wander around kinda lost, dealing with the strange little side quests that in most games I&rsquo;d feel compelled to ignore just to get the main mission done.</p>
<p>The so-called physics and chemistry engine is such that there&rsquo;s a real sense of freedom. You can do almost anything you think you might be able to do within the scope of the game. Metal swords are good for stabbing monsters, sure. But they can also create a spark which, if you do it with some flint near a pile of wood, will start a fire and let you cook some food. The updraft from said heat source lets you float upwards should you have the right equipment. You could also use the fire to light an arrow and fire it to ignite any dry grass around where monsters are having a nap consume them in a fiery death. There&rsquo;s probably 100 other things you could do like that I never discovered.</p>
<p>Even watching someone else play it for a while gave me a pleasant sense of the kind of feeling one gets when travelling to a new place and exploring in real life. This was most welcome at the time, as it was the heart of the Covid-19 lockdown when actually travelling anywhere wasn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p>And as you can see from the screenshot, it&rsquo;s a mostly pretty, nature-based place, which made me wonder if there&rsquo;s any research out there about using computer games to provide a mild version of the benefits humans tend to get with actual exploration in the natural world. Whilst this might sound a bit implausible, and it certainly won&rsquo;t provide the substantial benefits of the physical activity that&rsquo;s typically associated with exploring the outdoors, there are supposedly health benefits that can be realised via some video games. That&rsquo;s a topic I&rsquo;d like to explore sometimes.</p>
<p>One tip that I wished I&rsquo;d have known before playing (for compulsive in-game hoarders such as myself) is that you really don&rsquo;t need to keep most of the things you find. You don&rsquo;t need to collect and upgrade everything to win. If you follow the main storyline then the end battle isn&rsquo;t actually super hard, and I&rsquo;m really not that good at videogames - I never really mastered the combat in this one.</p>
<p>But by the end I was constantly running out of inventory space.  So feel free to sell most of the &ldquo;consumable&rdquo; things that you discover, even some of the valuable ore, to make enough money to buy the stuff in the shops that will make life less frustrating, some of which is basically essential. You can almost always find more of whatever consumables you run out of. Of course if you&rsquo;re a pro trying to collect and upgrade 100% of everything then this may be terrible advice.</p>

			 <p>Listening to <a href="https://album.link/es/i/1622579188">Hold The Girl</a> by Rina Sawayama 🎶.</p>

<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_the_Gir">currently lists</a> it as being some combination of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1990s alternative rock, pop rock, soft rock, Europop, trance, industrial, country pop, hi-NRG, pop punk, Eurotrance, stadium rock, Britpop, disco, R&amp;B, hyperpop, J-pop, house, Eurodance, electronic, UK garage, techno, folk and psychedelic music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, there&rsquo;s got to be something for most people on this album. Here&rsquo;s one I liked.</p>

			 <p>The rule of thumb that, in exchange for having expensive seeming prices and usage restrictions on its devices, Apple was less likely to creepily surveil and store your personal behavioural data on its servers for undisclosed and unknowable reasons seems to be invalid now.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago we saw Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/">What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone</a>&rdquo; marketing slogan.  More recently though  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558">researchers have shown</a> that, even when you disable the sharing of device analytics, the App Store and many of the other built-in iPhone apps send tracking info back to apple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;including what you tapped on, which apps you search for, what ads you saw, and how long you looked at a given app and how you found it. The app sent details about you and your device as well, including ID numbers, what kind of phone you’re using, your screen resolution, your keyboard languages, how you’re connected to the internet&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;your list of watched stocks, the names stocks you viewed or searched for and time stamps for when you did it, as well as a record of any news articles you see in the app&hellip;</p>

<p>I guess if the future of Apple does end up involving showing <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/app_store_ads_gone_wild">scammy looking adverts promoting gambling</a> wherever they can slot them in then this is the kind of thing we would expect.</p>

			 <p>I learned a lot about eating poo this week. Apparently it&rsquo;s well-known that <a href="https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/rabbits-eat-poop/">rabbits eat their own faeces</a> - or at least the caecotroph variant of droppings. The nutrients it still contains are good for their health.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we found a species that eats a good amount of any other species' excrement.</p>
<p>A genetic analysis shows that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62135261">foxes eat dog poo,</a> particularly in environments where there&rsquo;s not much else out there to eat. Unsurprisingly poop is much easier to hunt than wild prey. Perhaps more surprisingly it has a similar calorific content.</p>
<p>It does potentially add to the risk of disease, including of new pathogens appearing -  so I doubt &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeding the foxes&rdquo;  can be considered a valid excuse for not being bothered to pick up any dog faeces you may be responsible for.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a common idea that you can translate the age of a dog to the equivalent age of a human by multiplying by 7. It&rsquo;s easily disprovable at a basic level insomuch as different breeds of dogs tend to live for <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-age">different numbers of years</a> . I chanced upon <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/829192v2">a preprint</a> that also suggests the idea of a linear &ldquo;human years multiplied by X&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t right either.</p>
<p>Something more akin to reality turns out to involve slightly more complicated math. The researchers based their results on Labrador retrievers as the reference dog, and determined via comparing methylomes between species that the relationship between humans and dog lives <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-s-the-real-human-equivalent-of-your-dog-s-age-here-s-a-new-formula-to-figure-it-out">is better expressed as</a>:</p>
<p><code>human age = 16ln(dog age) + 31</code></p>
<p>The ln there represents taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm">natural log</a> of a number, which you can calculate <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/Ln_Calc.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>One advantage of this non-linear view is that it allows certain physiological milestones line up much better - for example lining up the typical time puppies and humans develop teeth, as well as correspondingly similar average overall lifespans.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942">All Our Relations</a> by Tanya Talaga 📚.</p>
<p>Starting out by focussing on a suicide epidemic amongst young Canadian Indigenous people, this book chronicles the historic, and unfortunately oftentimes ongoing, injustices that have been meted out on Indigenous people ever since the usually white European colonists &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; the &lsquo;New World&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From a past of overtly eliminating a people they regarded as inferior, through to more recent decades which included a &lsquo;residential schools&rsquo; policy forcibly assimilating any remaining Indigenous children, the author argues that the now-dominant society has caused physical, mental, cultural and spiritual crises amongst entire communities of Indigenous people.</p>
<p>A few success stories are included showing that there may be hope when these communities are able to develop or collaborate on culturally and practically relevant solutions to situations so bad that poor health, poverty, addiction, isolation, despair and even suicide is commonplace.</p>
<p>The focus seems mainly on the Canadian experience, but several examples from elsewhere are provided. Upsettingly, they lead towards the conclusion that the offences committed against, and resulting challenges faced by, Indigenous people around the world are quite similar.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/18/the-conservative-autumn.html">The Conservative Autumn Statement seems short term...progressive?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/18/the-conservative-autumn.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-18 17:40:10 &#43;0000">Nov 18, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m somewhat shocked to feel this way given the source, but I don&rsquo;t hate all the policies from the Conservative&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget">autumn statement</a> announced yesterday. At least not in the short term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much changes within a few weeks. Whilst some of the policies under the Truss administration <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/07/freezing-tax-thresholds.html">weren&rsquo;t nearly as tax-cutting as it seemed</a> on the surface, they were <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html">extremely regressive</a>. Just last month we were hearing that the top rate of income tax was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2022/oct/02/liz-truss-admits-mistakes-over-mini-budget-but-stands-by-45-top-rate-tax-cut-video">going to be entirely abolished</a> - free money for the rich! And now under the Sunak administration it&rsquo;s actually going to be applied to more people; anyone with an income of over around £125k as opposed to the current £150k.</p>
<p>Benefits are going up inline with inflation, we&rsquo;re seeing an increase in capital gains tax and a fiscal drag on inheritance tax. And a windfall tax on the incredible profits of energy producers. All very un-Conservative-stereotype.</p>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s still grim news in the economy - basically everyone is going to be worse off in the near feature. Living standards are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/biggest-hit-to-living-standards-on-record-as-jeremy-hunt-lays-out-autumn-statement">set to fall</a> by an unprecedented 7%. Plenty of this is due to the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/13/some-context-as.html">abject mismanagement</a> of the economy by the Conservative party in recent times.  Unemployment, inflation and energy bills are all set to rise. If you&rsquo;re already struggling that&rsquo;s obviously a much huger burden than if you&rsquo;re doing well enough right now.</p>
<p>The statement&rsquo;s policies are not nearly enough to make life particularly bearable for anyone already in or near crisis. But, I guess, credit where credit&rsquo;s due - the tax changes announced yesterday are actually somewhat progressive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reproduction of the impact <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/help-today-squeeze-tomorrow/">calculated by the Resolution Foundation</a> provided by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/british-people-poorer-ifs-uk-autumn-statement">the Guardian</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/8fdae50376.png" width="600" height="479" alt="" />
<p>Where the statement is rather more disingenuous is with regards to cuts in public funding. Cuts to public services tend to impact the poorest in society more than the rich. Cuts are certainly in the statement, and they&rsquo;re big (and <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/austerity-policies-kill.html">dangerous</a>). But the bulk of them are scheduled not to hit until 2024-2025. Of course by then there&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;ll have had a general election. A cynic might suggest it&rsquo;s a cursed gift from a party that doesn&rsquo;t really believe it&rsquo;ll be in power at that point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s mostly more of the same, so if you found the (post-introduction of female scientists) stereotypes problematic then you still will. If you found the geek references, characters or general style annoying or stale then not all that much changed. But if you took pleasure from the fairly predictable series and its nerdy references then it&rsquo;s worth finishing it off.</p>
<p>Much of the ending is comfortably heart-warming, although I do feel sympathy for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/the-big-bang-theory-finale-penny-pregnancy.html">Kathryn VanArendonk&rsquo;s frustration</a> with one of the storylines (warning: the link containers spoilers, albeit for a 3 year old episode).</p>

<p>The wellbeing agenda, with its focus on milder problems, can lead to great statistics in a way that doesn’t work for severe mental illness</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/10/england-mental-health-services-compassion-scandals-patients">This</a> is a sentiment I feel I&rsquo;ve seen from quite a few articles recently.</p>
<p>Not just in terms of statistics, but a more general idea that we may finally be becoming more understanding and supportive of people with more common, typically less severe, mental health issues such as mild anxiety or depression - something that is undoubtedly good and necessary. But that there&rsquo;s a way in which it&rsquo;s been somewhat at the expense of folk with extremely serious and debilitating conditions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have a sense of to what extent this is a real phenomenon or not. But it does seem like it&rsquo;s an idea that&rsquo;s in the ether at present.</p>

			 <p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4126641">recent paper</a> quantifies the economic inequities exacerbated by the way that credit cards that offer rewards to their users work.</p>
<p>Of course the cost of these rewards has to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>This includes the various fees and interest charged by the credit card companies to its users. Unsurprisingly, people with low credit scores are more likely to end up paying these fees.</p>
<p>Now whilst credit rating doesn&rsquo;t correlate 1:1 with e.g. income - so as the paper says the net effect isn&rsquo;t a <em>pure</em> &ldquo;take money from the poor to give to the rich&rdquo; money grab - it does predictably correlate with various other dimensions of potential privilege. It&rsquo;s obviously a lot easier to pay off your credit card balance and not incur interest charges if you have a big pile of existing money at your disposal.</p>
<p>Credit card companies also make money by charging shops every time a customer uses their credit card. To the extent that the need to fund rewards results in the credit card companies increasing the merchant fees to retailers, who correspondingly increase their products' prices to compensate, that&rsquo;s also another way that poorer folk may be penalised - a small % increase in cost may not be noticed by the wealthy, but for people in poverty it might be that every penny counts.</p>
<p>Retailers don&rsquo;t usually charge different prices for customers based on which card they use to purchase something, and so those people who don&rsquo;t choose to use or do not have access to rewards credit cards may end up paying for other people to get rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We estimate an aggregate annual redistribution of $15 billion from less to more educated, poorer to richer, and high to low minority areas, widening existing spatial disparities.</p>

			 <p>Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1645937249">Midnights</a>, by Taylor Swift 🎶.</p>
<p>In possibly the coldest take available on the internet today, Taylor Swift&rsquo;s new album is really good. It&rsquo;s <a href="">broken a few records</a> in terms of sales and popularity.</p>
<p>When I first listened to it I felt like all the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/taylor-swift-midnights-switched-on-pop.html">bassy synths</a> gave it a kind of ominous feel that I didn&rsquo;t need in 2022, but a couple of listens later and I fully appreciate it. The general conceit is that each song reflects a sleepless night of her life, and sure enough some of the included angst may be familiar to those of us who are not multi-millionaire musical megastars too.</p>
<p>Apparently the album is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/09/how-taylor-swift-turned-pop-into-a-multiplayer-puzzle">filled with secret messages</a> for the internet to discover. I came to Swift far too late and probably lackadaisically to get any of them but they&rsquo;re there for those more informed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the highlights, with a fun spooky (albeit <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-fat-anti-hero-video-b2211554.html">originally controversial</a>) video.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/06/immigration-to-meet.html">Immigration to meet unfilled medical staff needs is a popular policy</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/06/immigration-to-meet.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-06 14:34:28 &#43;0000">Nov 6, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Things like <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167">this</a> are exactly what cause me <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html">angst about joining the Labour party</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair the headline &ldquo;<em>Keir Starmer: Too many people from overseas recruited to NHS</em>&rdquo; is a little selective, perhaps misleadingly so. Within the same interview Starmer also said he&rsquo;d encourage immigration for different types of jobs. He also acknowledged that we have a desperate need for more NHS staff. But his proposed solution was that the UK needs to do way more in terms of increasing training opportunities and making jobs in the NHS bearable enough that any sane person isn&rsquo;t so deterred by the conditions that they wouldn&rsquo;t want the training in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fully on board with that as a plank of the approach. It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. But it&rsquo;s not an either/or situation. We have a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-staff-crisis-20000-doctors-28417859">NHS staffing crisis</a> right now. Earlier this year it was calculated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/staffing-crisis-deepens-in-nhs-england-with-110000-posts-unfilled">around 110,000 NHS vacancies were unfilled</a>. A British politician with the wellbeing of their constituents in mind should use whatever reasonable means we have to solve it.</p>
<p>Starmer is not known to be a naïve or stupid politician so when he said &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d have understood how that might sound.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly gruelling about this example is that reducing the immigration of medical workers isn&rsquo;t even a popular policy. In the latest poll I can find, most people are actively in favour of immigration in terms of increasing the supply of doctors and nurses in the UK.</p>
<p>From page 15 of <a href="https://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Shifting-Views-Report-Oct-2022-FINAL.pdf">the British Future report</a> on attitudes to immigration this year:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/9308786c51.png" width="600" height="363" alt="" />
<p>55% of respondents to this survey commissioned from IPSOS, designed to be representative of the British pouplation,  would prefer recruitment of migrants as nurses to increase, with only 13% against. The figures for doctors are very similar.</p>
<p>Even most <em>Conservative party supporters</em> are in favour! Compared to Labour supporters they&rsquo;re more likely to say the numbers should be reduced, but only by a few percentage points.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/02a33840de.png" width="600" height="506" alt="" />
<p>Of course this might not be apparent in the public discourse. Inevitably there is a certain percentage of the population who would rather see the immigration numbers go down than sustain the NHS. They&rsquo;re loudly represented on social media, likely encouraged by the recent Conservative tendency to seemingly try and recreate a US-style <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-tories-plan-assault-woke-culture-war/">culture war</a> to our shores.</p>
<p>This is not to say that what job you do necessarily should be the basis of your ability to immigrate to the UK - I believe it <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> be. But the point is that there is likely little need to &ldquo;strategically&rdquo; appear to be against immigration to fill NHS positions if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on,  because most of the population actually wants to see more.</p>
<p>There certainly is a moral case to be made against encouraging immigration to fulfil Britain&rsquo;s unmet medical needs, but it&rsquo;s a very different one. As Kollar and Buyx write in <a href="https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2013.13845">their review</a> of this phenomena:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Health-worker migration, commonly called “medical brain drain”, refers to the mass migration of trained and skilled health professionals (doctors, nurses, midwives) from low-income to high-income countries. This is currently leaving a significant number of poor countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with critical staff shortages in the healthcare sector. A broad consensus exists that, where medical brain drain exacerbates such shortages, it is unethical&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplistically, one foreign nurse moving here is potentially one less nurse serving the country they were originally in. If done en masse, probably some recompense, ideally of a structural nature, should be given. However, this debate doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the one that interests the politicians, media or general public at present.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141184999">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez 📚.</p>
<p>This one is a real classic, perhaps the archetype of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Magic_realism">magical realism</a> . That&rsquo;s a style most associated with Latin American authors where things are going along just like we might ourselves expect to happen in real life. But occasionally something unquestionably fantastical happens. People fly, ghosts appear, spells are cast - whatever you can imagine. But to the characters in the book it&rsquo;s perfectly normal, not even worth remarking on. Their world just works that way.</p>
<p>This book tells the story of many generations of a family in a beautiful, sometimes poetic, manner. In some parts it felt like hearing someone&rsquo;s dream experience, other times more like a myth or legend from times long past.</p>
<p>Parts were somewhat disorientating to me, not least because many of the characters have similar names to each other; a fact remarked on within the book. It should be noted that there are some &lsquo;uncomfortable&rsquo; scenes, and took me a good amount of focus to get through it. But it was an entirely worthwhile effort to make.</p>

<p>So I liked it, but I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek">Daleks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman">Cybermen</a> enough as sci-fi enemies that you could even put them in <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/01/matt-hancock-the.html">Matt Hancock&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity&rdquo;</a> and I&rsquo;d say it was good. Add in the master, UNIT and the actual companions and various previous incarnations of the eponymous hero themselves from decades-old episodes and it can&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>It might be fairly said that the story itself was rather chaotic and incoherent at times, so I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who thought it was too messy to follow. But if you have any nostalgia for Dr W then you&rsquo;ll probably like it.</p>
<p>Also a great ending. I often regret seeing all the early &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61371123">the next Doctor will be played by X</a>&rdquo; stories as it naturally  spoils the when and who of the relevant episode&rsquo;s grand finale.

			 <p><img src="uploads/2022/dca23413d6.jpg" width="220" height="330" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" />Happy Halloween!</p>
<p>My current favourite recently-learned spooky fact is that the infamous film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist">The Exorcist</a> - the one that originally induced audiences to faint, vomit and maybe even have heart attacks - is in fact based on a true story. It&rsquo;s the story of Ronald Edwin Hunkeler, although his name wasn&rsquo;t widely known <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/20/the-exorcist-boy-named-magazine">until last year</a>, after he had died the year before.</p>
<p>From the age of 14 it was reported that he had been <a href="https://screenrant.com/exorcist-movie-true-story-regan-roland-doe-explained/">possessed by something menacing</a>. People around him heard strange noise, and things flew around the house. Red scratches appeared on his body, spelling out various words. He had violent outbursts and spoke Latin phrases in a strange voice. Walls shook and furniture slid. All of which you may have seen in the film&rsquo;s recreation, albeit featuring a younger girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that the infamous head-spinning scene actually happened in Ronald&rsquo;s case though. Which is shown below, but perhaps don&rsquo;t click on it if you don&rsquo;t like scary things or bad language.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>In later life, Ronald became a NASA engineer. His work was used in the 1960s Apollo space missions and, more recently, for space shuttle materials. He apparently went out of his way to ensure people didn&rsquo;t know of his exorcist related history, unfortunately going through his life always afraid of people figuring it out.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it&rsquo;s now a matter of debate how true the true story was. The fact that The Exorcist is based on Ronald and what people around him reported is true. But whether the original events concerned were of paranormal origin or were in fact deliberate trickery done by the kid has been <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2001/01/exorcism-driving-out-the-nonsense/">questioned at some length</a>. But even if it was an act, it sounds like it was an unusually convincing and long-lasting one from a likely troubled child.</p>

			 <p>A descendent of Captain William Humphries has <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/library-books-overdue-man-returns-book-84-years-late-and-pays-the-fine/e9c197c5-7fe5-4060-9286-674b74354777">finally returned</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14375826-red-deer">Red Deer</a>&rdquo; - a book by Richard Jefferies that he borrowed in 1938 to a library in Coventry.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/0a59f25b93.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s in good condition apparently, which is kind of amazing when most likely it was kept in a house that was bombed in the Blitz.</p>
<p>Being 84 years overdue it had accumulated quite a fine. Fortunately at 1 old penny a day it only worked out to £18.27 in today&rsquo;s money. Embarrassingly, I&rsquo;ve paid library fines bigger than that. Today the library charges 25p per day, so if someone pulls the same stunt again <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-63404340">that&rsquo;ll cost them £7673</a>.</p>
<p>It was returned by the Captain&rsquo;s grandson Paddy Riordan, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-63404340">told the BBC</a> that he wasn&rsquo;t sure why it had taken so long to get returned, but &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t that exciting a book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Believe it or not it&rsquo;s by no means the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67353-most-overdue-library-book">most overdue return</a> of a library book. That honour is held  by the catchily named &ldquo;Scriptores rerum Germanicarum septentrionalium, vicinorumque populorum diversi&rdquo;. That translates to &ldquo;Various historians of the Northern Germans and of neighbouring peoples&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A copy of that book was <a href="https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/worlds-most-overdue-library-book">returned to Sidney Sussex College 288 years after</a> it had been borrowed in the year 1668.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/5771f61280.jpg" width="385" height="600" alt="" />
<p>This one had been borrowed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole_(colonel)">Colonel Robert Walpole</a>, who was an MP in 1689, and the father of the confusingly similar named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a>, who Wikipedia records as being the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom">Prime Minister of the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In that case no fine was exacted.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re descended from some Kashmir mountain goats that Queen Victoria, forgetting that a goat is for life, not just for Christmas, gave to Llandudno a century ago (or perhaps actually <a href="https://www.llandudno.com/the-great-orme-kashmiri-goats/">regifted from the Shah of Persia</a>, to be accurate). She may have been a <a href="https://spearswms.com/the-story-of-cashmere-from-queen-victoria-to-loro-piana/">big fan of cashemere</a>, but somehow hadn&rsquo;t foreseen that Covid restrictions 100 years later would mean that their descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have access to contraception.</p>
<p>Consequently: welcome to the baby boom generation of the goat world. OK boomer.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/b628993a44.png" width="539" height="417" alt="" />
<p>Who amongst us hasn&rsquo;t been caught running wild in streets, sleeping in bus shelters, fighting in the car park and snacking on people&rsquo;s hedges?   Nonetheless, the goats have seemingly been encouraged to return to their home, <a href="https://www.visitconwy.org.uk/explore/outdoors/great-orme-country-park">Great Orme</a>.</p>
<p>It all seems very good natured, with positive sentiments about them abounding, from anyone who hasn&rsquo;t had their houses eaten at least. I&rsquo;d imagine their relocation has probably not been entirely devoid of controversy though.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/councils-stance-great-orme-goats-20632525">there were rumours</a> that they&rsquo;d end up on the set of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity&hellip;Get me out of here!&rdquo; also known as <a href="https://www.gwrychcastle.co.uk/">Gwrych Castle</a>, which naturally is already full of beasts of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54724807">more spectral persuasion</a>. Some of the residents of Llandudno were not super pleased at this idea, with one ominously suggesting that &ldquo;If they take more than a few goats then people are going to be very upset.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(Also: a special thank you to my friend for highlighting this story - in memoriam of a site I used to have many years ago, sadly no longer in existence, which went through a phase of sharing these kind of critical goat news updates.)</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a recent tradition that each new Conservative Prime Minister gets to help design <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/10/25/liz-truss-downing-street-lectern-retired/">their own special lectern</a> to deliver speeches from. They cost £2000-£4000 to make; a lucrative business in recent times I guess.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/e0f3bd6fd1.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="" />
<p>It seems like they&rsquo;re usually supposed to convey a certain something the PM wants to project. David Cameron&rsquo;s was supposed to look statesmanlike. Theresa May&rsquo;s was designed to look feminine. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s was a bit bulkier in order to cope with him thumping it during his more rousing speeches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the intent behind Liz Truss' twisty one, but it&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/barrymcgee/status/1583071601016217600">often described</a> as looking like a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Jenga</a>. Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Wikipedia&rsquo;s description</a> of that game as involving &ldquo;creating a progressively more unstable structure&rdquo; this seems apt.</p>
<p>The version of it that was used for speeches in the Conservative HQ is predictably <a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Diver/status/1584854834716758017">covered in Union Jack designs</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/a2c87377b1.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="" />
<p>Poor Rishi Sunak was appointed in such a hurry that there wasn&rsquo;t time for him to design his own one. He&rsquo;s ended up with a straight edition of Liz Truss&rsquo;s one that had been created &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Diver/status/1584854834716758017">just in case</a>&rdquo;. In case of exactly <em>what</em> I&rsquo;m not sure, but, hey, it turned out to be useful after all.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html">850k people</a> being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million.</p>

<p>However, in the present time of a truly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism">dangerous</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began">chaotic</a> government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them. If <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/labour-poll-lead-tory-wipeout_uk_634d98a6e4b0b7f89f59852c">recent polling</a> carried forth into actual votes they&rsquo;d in fact have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory">landslide victory</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love <a href="https://labour.org.uk/">the Labour website</a>. The first thing you see is a form requesting your contact details on top of a somewhat nausea-inducing background video sequence. Then, inevitably, a cookies popup that as far as I can see you can&rsquo;t actually <em>decline</em>, along with a donation popup.</p>
<p>But get through all of that and there&rsquo;s a link to &ldquo;<a href="https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/">Labour&rsquo;s vision for Britain</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/">not convinced</a> that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0">up to a point</a>.</p>
<p>As to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy.</p>
<p>At a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I&rsquo;m nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there&rsquo;s an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there&rsquo;s any evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;we want more fair and good green jobs&rdquo;- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it&rsquo;s a reasonable vision to have.</p>
<p>In former days it&rsquo;d be one of those annoying generic slogans that it&rsquo;s hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/">the opposite</a>. At times the Conservatives seem <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637">desperate to inject culture-war topics</a> into the UK political sphere which isn&rsquo;t going to help on anything environmental.</p>
<p>What other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their <a href="https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/">campaigns page</a>. Here&rsquo;s roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.</p>
<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boost people&rsquo;s income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.</li>
<li>Ban zero hours contracts and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; self-employment.</li>
<li>End the &ldquo;qualifying periods&rdquo; some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave.</li>
<li>Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.</li>
<li>Ensure people who have prepayment meters don&rsquo;t pay more for energy than everyone else.</li>
<li>Insulate all homes that need it.</li>
<li>Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.</li>
<li>Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="economy">Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build industries in every region of the UK.</li>
<li>Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.</li>
<li>Create a national wealth fund.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing</li>
<li>Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.</li>
<li>Introduce rules on strip-searching children.</li>
<li>Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.</li>
<li>Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>Expand the NHS workforce by:</p>
<ul>
<li>doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year.</li>
<li>creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year.</li>
<li>training 5000 new health visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>Primary school education: &ldquo;Build a Britain where children come first&rdquo; - this one was extremely vague.</p>
<h3 id="home-ownership">Home ownership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Target 70% home ownership.</li>
<li>Build high quality affordable homes</li>
<li>Reform the private rented sector</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-of-the-things-i-liked-in-what-i-saw">Some of the things I liked in what I saw:</h2>
<p>An emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701">to make use of food banks</a>, need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd.</p>
<p>Banning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don&rsquo;t know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they&rsquo;re right to identify that, surprise surprise, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts">that&rsquo;s not what actually happens at present</a> so it might be a good policy in net terms.</p>
<p>The green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first. Actually it <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns">already is doing so</a>. Mitigating climate change should be a priority for every party, particularly as we already know a lot of what needs to be done - it&rsquo;s a case of actually <em>doing</em> it.</p>
<p>Expanding the NHS workforce, assuming this comes with investment. After the Covid pandemic and chronic mismanagement on the part of the Conservatives, the NHS is in a quite precarious state with huge waiting lists to catch up on - including 6 million people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high">waiting to start hospital treatment</a>. Whether this expansion can happen fast enough to be the only major change needed I don&rsquo;t know - I would assume not - but it&rsquo;s clearly a necessary step for the future.</p>
<p>A focus on domestic abuse and other violence against women, areas of crime that are unfortunately common and also very rarely prosecuted in many cases.</p>
<p>Creating of a publicly owned energy company - to facilitate the shift towards green energy, but also to create jobs, reduce dependence on countries such as Russia, build resilience and in the end lower fuel bills. I&rsquo;m happy Labour aren&rsquo;t scared to introduce policies that might be seen as being at least in the <em>direction</em> of nationalising parts of some critical industries, even if they have gone out of their way <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/great-british-energy-what-is-it-what-would-it-do-and-how-would-it-be-funded">to make it clear</a> that we&rsquo;re not talking about nationalising existing companies.</p>
<p>Taxing the vast profits of fossil fuel energy providers. This might prove somewhat impossible many cases when a lot of them are not British-situated companies. For those that are within the appropriate jurisdiction then it seems right to me to windfall-tax the profits of the energy producers which <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/oil-companies-massive-profits-first-quarter-russia-ukraine/">have been incredible</a> at a time when the cost of energy to consumers has created a real crisis.</p>
<p>Reforming the private rental sector - rents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/21/private-rents-britain-hit-record-high-demand-properties">have never been higher</a>. A few years ago the Conservative MPs, many of whom are themselves landlords in addition to their day job(s), <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-vote-down-law-requiring-landlords-make-their-homes-fit-for-human-habitation-a6809691.html">voted against</a> requiring landlords to make their homes be &lsquo;fit for human habitation&rsquo;. Reforming could mean many things, but I expect most of them would be better than today&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-things-i-felt-wary-about">Some of the things I felt wary about:</h2>
<p>A lot of the security section. &ldquo;Crack down on human traffickers&rdquo; is the sort of detail-free statement that always worries me on this topic.</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> mean creating compassionate policies to ensure people who want or need to get to the UK can do so in a safe and humane way to the benefit of us all. Or it could mean going full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">Farage</a> and inventing wave machines to literally push boats full of some of the most vulnerable people in the world back into the sea.</p>
<p>To be fair the latter idea was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12816615/home-office-wave-machine-migrants-channel/">dreamt up</a> (and thankfully discarded) under a Conservative administration - but I imagine Farage would also be into it. At least Labour&rsquo;s plans do specifically include cancelling the ridiculous and awful plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61097114">ship asylum seekers off to Rwanda</a>, which is a very good thing.</p>
<p>But, outside of that specific point, my fear is that is this &lsquo;cracking down&rsquo; will be more in the latter direction. Starmer <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23073096.keir-starmer-admits-little-difference-immigration-labour-tories/">has specifically said</a> that there&rsquo;s very little substantive difference between his party&rsquo;s thinking on immigration and that of the Conservative Party. In a time where the official policy is to create a &lsquo;<a href="https://theconversation.com/hostile-environment-the-uk-governments-draconian-immigration-policy-explained-95460">hostile environment</a>&rsquo; in a way that may not even actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/25/hostile-environment-unlawful-ehrc-report-windrush-scandal-policy">be legal</a>, this is the kind of thing that I find abhorrent enough to be extremely off-putting. I couldn&rsquo;t defend it.</p>
<p>I was disappointed there was almost nothing about education. My understanding is that the education workforce is depleted, of low morale and struggling with workload in an environment of damaging low budgets in a similar way to the NHS workforce. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/11/teachers-england-plan-to-quit-workloads-stress-trust">A poll</a> suggested half of the teachers in England plan to quit within the next 5 years. Most experience various degrees of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/22/schools-and-mental-health-why-teachers-are-quitting-the-industry-17501832/?ico=zone-post-strip_item_1_news">poor mental health</a> due to their work. There&rsquo;s also the impact of the disruption to normal schooling practices on all concerned - students, teachers and parents - that the pandemic triggered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually have liked to see a specific mention of mental health in general. It&rsquo;s estimated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/england-second-pandemic-mental-health-issues-nhs-covid">an astonishing 10 million people in England</a> would benefit from new or extra mental health support.</p>
<p>I also wished I&rsquo;d seen something about international aid or other policies that support the wellbeing of people in other countries. Britain does not exist in isolation. Despite the frantic and damaging chaos resulting from recent UK political decisions, there remain countries that are in far worse states with their populations suffering solvable trauma. In some cases Britain may even have played an unfortunate part in creating the harms that they suffer. In all cases we should show them compassion.</p>

			 <p>Another day, another British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Now the UK is to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/24/sunak-poised-become-uk-pm-mordaunt-johnson-withdraw">led by Rishi Sunak</a> who was selected as Conservative Party leader without contest after his primary competitors dropped out.</p>

			 <p>Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-capture/seasons/2">season 2 of The Capture</a> 📺.</p>
<p>Another pretty gripping season of this thriller, following DI Carey now she&rsquo;s been promoted into the shadowy S015 organisation she fought against in the first season.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t love it quite as much as <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/12/watched-season-of.html">that season</a> - perhaps because it felt even more implausible and confusing at times. A part of that might also be that some of the ethical issues it raises are less novel to me.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the extremely blatant references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> (but in reality I think this stuff is far less effective than portrayed here - thankfully!) and tech companies like Huawei, alongside a reinforcement of the idea that modern-day politics is so much about presenting an &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; image.</p>

			 <p>Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1601542904">The Unraveling of PUPTheBand</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUP_(band)">PUP</a> 🎶.</p>
<p>One of my favourite albums of 2022 so far, from the Canadian punk rock band PUP.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/e0ddbb7d56.png" width="316" height="316" alt="" />
<p>I think I read somewhere that the piano interludes were added just because they might annoy their fans, although I can&rsquo;t find the source for that any more. That sense of just having a fun time doing whatever nonsense you feel like doing makes the album extra compelling to me. I mean, how can you not love any album that contains a love song written from the point of view of a robot?</p>

</div>

<p>I went back and listened to their other 3 albums - <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1631000383">PUP</a>, <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1631000419">The Dream Is Over</a> and <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1449065618">Morbid Stuff</a>. Each one was a good time.</p>

<p>2021&rsquo;s James Bond film, containing most of the classic Bond tropes enacted in big fun implausible style, still managing to surprise here and there. The sexism has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/30/never-mind-the-explosions-how-sexist-is-no-time-to-die">dialled down</a> vs some of the older films, but not in &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; way.

			 <p>So the UK has yet another <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/jeremy-hunt-named-as-new-chancellor-by-liz-truss/ar-AA12XEJS">new chancellor</a> - Jeremy Hunt - thanks to Liz Truss' latest enforced u-turn.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Conservative party continues to apparently be playing a game of randomly selecting economic strategies from a bag of policies totally unsuitable for the current economic situation, as we&rsquo;re likely heading back into a time of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/15/health-teaching-unions-jeremy-hunt-tory-austerity">deliberate austerity</a>.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that not only do unfathomable cuts to public services cause misery for the population - think for example of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/13/record-7-million-people-awaiting-hospital-treatment-says-nhs-england">7 million people currently on waitlists for hospital treatment</a> - they also kill us.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity">Austerity</a> policies naturally affect a lot more than healthcare expenditure, but it&rsquo;s perhaps there that their deadly effects can most clearly be estimated.</p>
<p>Last year researchers did their best to quantify the causal impact of constraining expenditure on social care, public health and healthcare in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/lost-decade-hidden-story-how-austerity-broke-britain">period of austerity</a> between 2010/2011–2014/2015. Their mean estimate was that the decrease in expenditure when compared with the trend for the 8 years before <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e046417">led to an extra 57.550 deaths</a> (albeit with a wide confidence interval - 3,075-111,195).</p>
<p>In modelling this, they concluded that an 1% increase in:</p>
<ul>
<li>healthcare expenditure reduces mortality by 0.532%;</li>
<li>social care expenditure reduces mortality by 0.336%;</li>
<li>local public health spending reduces mortality by 0.019%</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/11/e017722">different paper</a> from 5 years ago also attempted to look at the impact of us constraining healthcare and social care expenditure during 2011-2014. That group estimated an extra 45,368 people died  (95% CI 34,530-56,206) compared to trends before 2010. They suggest that investment in care homes and nurses are two important factors that could mitigate this.</p>

			 <p>Ever since learning about the prevalence and progress of AI-generated art, mainly via such a piece having <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed">won an art competition</a>, it&rsquo;s not left my mind for too long.  I was <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/should-artificial-intelligences-win-art-competitions/">kind of confused</a> how best to think about it then, and it&rsquo;s only got worse as time goes on. Herein are some further ramblings.</p>
<p>As a reminder, these are systems where you type in a prompt, e.g. &ldquo;Picture of a juggling elephant&rdquo; and out pops a picture of whatever you asked for. Right now the results aren&rsquo;t always great, hence the new vocation of &ldquo;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/">prompt engineer</a>&rdquo; - someone who knows what phrases to give to an AI for best result. But they&rsquo;re often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond.</p>
<p>There exist several famous such systems, including <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL-E</a>, <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> and <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>. Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it&rsquo;s derived from all the art and contextual information it&rsquo;s already seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists">This Guardian article</a> gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details.

<p>Given the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable that we&rsquo;ll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it&rsquo;s often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism&rsquo;s invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You&rsquo;d basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it&rsquo;s going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it&rsquo;ll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.</p>
<p>After all, even if it turns out that the very &lsquo;best&rsquo; art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there&rsquo;s a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it&rsquo;s extremely cheap to produce.</p>
<p>Automation replacing people in jobs is very much <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/">not new</a>, but it&rsquo;s traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t plenty of unpleasant, tedious, <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/">ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs</a>. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.</p>
<p>Whilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that&rsquo;s inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a &ldquo;<a href="https://designer.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Designer</a>&rdquo; component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing &ldquo;Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall&rdquo;, no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.</p>

<p>Stock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that <a href="(https://www.stockai.com/)">offer to generate you an AI-created image</a> if they don&rsquo;t already have something that meets your satisfaction. That&rsquo;s one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image">dedicated tools</a> reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Update: I did just that. Here&rsquo;s the image <a href="https://www.stockai.com/">stockai.com</a> generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/e41759a8f6.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There&rsquo;s no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not <em>directly</em>, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don&rsquo;t need to into their heads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> magazine already got into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists">some controversy</a> over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover">used an AI</a> to design one of its covers. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let&rsquo;s also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you <em>read</em> in certain publications are written by AIs - the <a href="https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/">automated journalism</a> trend, so it&rsquo;s not only visual creativity at play here.</p>
<p>But worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddites</a> who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn&rsquo;t win; they became an insult.</p>
<p>Sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it, they&rsquo;ll just get better jobs right away&rdquo; or &ldquo;but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end&rdquo; abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn&rsquo;t, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. But <em>in theory</em> we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.</p>
<p>What is less obvious to me is what a shift to most &ldquo;art&rdquo; we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are &ldquo;new&rdquo; for sure, in that they never existed before. But they&rsquo;re all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven&rsquo;t previously been combined - such as &ldquo;Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“A still of Kermit The Frog in Blade Runner 2049 (2017)” <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dalle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dalle</a> <a href="https://t.co/CxyWFRJETc">pic.twitter.com/CxyWFRJETc</a></p>&mdash; HeavensLastAngel (@HvnsLstAngel) <a href="https://twitter.com/HvnsLstAngel/status/1531506455714492416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>In other, more abstract cases, it&rsquo;s much less obvious.</p>
<p>But in any case, the machine needs feeding.</p>
<p>One might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they&rsquo;ve seen. To what extent is a human&rsquo;s art also a black box &ldquo;generative process&rdquo; based on all the artistic inputs they&rsquo;ve seen in their life? There&rsquo;s an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement">movements</a>&rdquo; exist in art - think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">Impressionism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism">Modernism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism">Neo-Classicism</a>, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But something starts those movements. What I don&rsquo;t know is whether that&rsquo;s something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn&rsquo;t deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.</p>
<p>But if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like &ldquo;optimise your output to please the most amount of people today&rdquo; then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of course possible I&rsquo;ve gotten this the wrong way round. An <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/">AI playing the game of Go</a> beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they&rsquo;ve been described as &lsquo;alien&rsquo; and &lsquo;from an alternate dimension&rsquo;. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we&rsquo;d never otherwise have imagined.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the more concerning &ldquo;getting stuck&rdquo; effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html">changed its once acclaimed artistic output</a> based on what it&rsquo;s algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet">eating out of toilets</a> because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how &ldquo;new&rdquo; this is; I&rsquo;m sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It&rsquo;s much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo;. That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes.</p>
<p>A little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don&rsquo;t have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I&rsquo;m not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people&rsquo;s art, a whole set of rights issues exist.</p>
<p>Being popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. <a href="https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski">Greg Rutkowski</a>  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/">become a common prompt</a> for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/">example shown by the MIT Technology Review</a> used the prompt <em>“Wizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski&quot;</em> which produced this:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/960bd94de6.png" width="600" height="397" alt="" />
<p>Now when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn&rsquo;t his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images. So if some entity wants to use some work that an AI explicitly created   based on having ingested hundreds of his images without permission then they&rsquo;re presumably free to do so. This has understandably <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352">left him with the opinion</a> that &ldquo;A.I. should exclude living artists from its database&rdquo;.  Which prompts me to additionally wonder about if there&rsquo;s any ethical considerations of note surrounding the possible AI exploitation of a <em>dead</em> artist&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>For now though, if the artist&rsquo;s images are on the internet then they&rsquo;re considered fair game. These systems don&rsquo;t ask artists to opt in to having their work included, and it&rsquo;s not clear that they even have the ability to opt out them. Some tools that at might at least let you know if your work has been used to train these AI systems have started to appear, including <a href="https://haveibeentrained.com/">Spawn&rsquo;s Have I Been Trained?</a>.</p>
<p>To what extent this is different from a human artist enjoying Rutkowski&rsquo;s pictures and later creating something in a similar style is something that perhaps still needs to be thrashed out. After all, the ingested pictures were on the publicly accessible internet in the first place. But the big difference here is of course accessibility and scale. The new part is that is that a single person or business with no art knowledge or skill can generate hundreds of &ldquo;original&rdquo; Rutkowski style pictures a day with no artistic ability and little-to-no resources.</p>
<p>This opens up new possibilities for the masses, which could be a positive thing - see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-ai-makes-art/">the optimistic possibility Wired presents</a> of &ldquo;dramatically expanding the number of people able to generate and experiment with art and illustration&rdquo;. But left without consideration, it may also result in a pretty devastating exploitation of people&rsquo;s hitherto highly valued work. And potentially a world where it feels like we&rsquo;re immersed in some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Borges' style Library of Babel</a> but for whichever genre of art is algorithmically popular or convenient, with a possible plot twist of any remaining human artists <a href="https://twitter.com/OnTheGranblue/status/1578632039326441472">being accused of being AIs</a>.</p>

			 <p>Channel 4 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/oct/13/channel-4-show-art-trouble-hitler-painting?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">created a show</a> where they purchase artwork from &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; artists such as Pablo Picasso (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso#Personal_life">misogynist</a>), Rolf Harris (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Harris#Sexual_offences">paedophile</a>), Eric Gill (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill#Sexual_abuse">sex abuser</a>) and umm&hellip;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Hitler</a> (I surely don&rsquo;t need to explain this one).

			 <p><img src="uploads/2022/d8e574c000.jpg" width="250" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" />In an event that definitely isn&rsquo;t straight out of a Stephen King horror novel, <a href="https://www.insider.com/north-carolina-buzzards-with-acidic-dropping-invade-a-small-town-2021-10">a huge flock of vultures has inexplicably descended</a> upon the small town of Bunn, North Carolina.</p>
<p>These are some big beasts, also known as buzzards in American English, with wing-spans of 5-6 foot. They destroy houses by pecking out the bricks, and pulling off roof tiles and caulking. They ruin cars, scratching the paint, cracking the windows and ripping off the windscreen wipers. Their acid poo also just eats through any paintwork. Finally, if they feel threatened, they vomit all over you.</p>
<p>For a while the town was <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article247885620.html">firing a cannon at them</a> regularly to try and scare them off. It didn&rsquo;t last; they&rsquo;re back. Not even hanging spooky effigies around the place is doing the job.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/13/another-study-associates.html">Another study associates increased step count with several positive health outcomes</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/13/another-study-associates.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-10-13 11:31:54 &#43;0000">Oct 13, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02012-w">new paper</a> examining the links between the average daily step count (as measured by Fitbit) and the health outcomes of ~6,000 people reinforces the idea that being more active is good for our health in many dimensions.</p>
<p>Steps per day negatively correlated with obesity, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/d110a5f659.png" width="600" height="496" alt="" />
<p>One takeaway I&rsquo;d have is that in general more is always better, at least up to the thresholds displayed on the chart. There&rsquo;s nothing special about the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/10000-steps-rule/590785/">(in?)famous 10k steps a day goal</a> in many of these curves. So an increase in physical activity is likely worthwhile irrespective of whether you&rsquo;re going from 2,000 to 3,000 steps, or 9.000 to 10,000.</p>
<p>That said, being observational, the study cannot truly prove that the increased steps is what <em>caused</em> the better health outcomes, although the authors do attempt to reduce the risk of reverse causation (i.e. good health leads to more steps) . Studies like these also cannot truly control for every possible confounder.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, whilst the conclusion isn&rsquo;t exactly surprising, it&rsquo;s nice to see a study that looked at a reasonably high number of people over a reasonably long time frame - the median step-monitoring period being 4 years -  and made an effort to control for various external confounders.</p>

But it is a fun read, with enough mystery to be very compelling. I enjoyed the informal, very relatable, tone.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://howtomeasureghosts.substack.com/p/jan-9th-and-may-24th-2007">a piece</a> arguing that the start of the &lsquo;current era&rsquo; began with the dual inventions of the iPhone and Facebook, Matt Locke succinctly summarises up how the challenges facing those of us who work with data have changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem of measuring the audience has been inverted - instead of having to use complex maths to extrapolate tiny data sets to represent huge audiences, we now use complex maths to reduce huge data sets until they represent tiny audiences.</p>

			 <p>The Truss administration&rsquo;s obsessive and damaging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan">focus on reducing taxes</a>, particularly for the wealthy and corporations, at any cost has led to her policies being eviscerated by all sorts of organisations and individuals, including many people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/its-extraordinary-liz-trusss-low-tax-gamble-has-yet-to-convince-tory-mps">from her own party</a>.</p>
<p>The irony, according to <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/reforms-roll-outs-and-freezes-tax-and-benefit-system">an analysis </a>by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is that the average household will actually end up paying <em>more</em> tax overall, due to the Conservative&rsquo;s stated policy of freezing the thresholds at which we start to pay income tax for four years, alongside many other tax and benefit related thresholds.</p>
<p>Of course due to inflation - and we have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12196322">a lot of that</a> at the moment - keeping the threshold at which tax is due to the same nominal amount means that more people reach that threshold without them having achieved any additional real spending power. But &ldquo;quietly freeze things as they are&rdquo; is a much less attention grabbing policy than &ldquo;make wild cuts to specific things&rdquo; so the effects might not be as well-known as other parts of their catastrophic <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html">mini-budget</a>.</p>
<p>The IFS analysis suggests that by 2025-2, 1.4 million more people will be paying income tax, costing basic-rate tax payers an extra £500 per year.</p>
<p>1.6 million more people will be paying higher-rate tax, which will cost them about £3,000 extra per year.</p>
<p>An extra 125k people will be affected by the benefit cap, and 500k more families will lose some or all of their child benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;on average for every £1 households gain from high-profile cuts to rates of income tax and National Insurance, they lose £2 from the freezes and policy roll-outs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst literally every income decile will see negative effects to their income, it nets out in a regressive way with the poorest section of society seeing a 2.8% reduction of income, vs 1.1% for the richest.</p>

			 <p>Just to add further confusion to my <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/05/should-i-use.html">plastic recycling dilemma</a>, the <a href="https://www.ciwm.co.uk/">Chartered Institution of Wastes Management</a> has <a href="https://www.ciwm.co.uk/ciwm/news/2022/ciwm_statement_in_response_to_i_paper_article.aspx">responded</a> to the claim of &ldquo;a lot of your plastic recycling ends up in the Asian sea&rdquo; by claiming that&rsquo;s misinformation, as under 3% of UK plastic recycling is exported to that region and almost none goes to India or the Philippines.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees though that the most effective measure is to not create the waste in the first place.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just after I&rsquo;ve upped my plastic recycling game after reading <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/book-notes-turning.html">a book about the horrors of excess plastic</a>, I read <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/landfill-better-recycled-plastic-ends-up-sea-1891207">an article</a> suggesting that it might all be even more in vain than the book suggested.</p>
<p>The way &ldquo;rich&rdquo; countries like the UK often deal with the waste they&rsquo;ve collected for recycling is not to actually recycle it themselves, but rather just palm it off to any other poorer country that can be exploited to accept it. Then the receiving country has to figure out how to actually deal with it.</p>
<p>But some of these countries are not all that fastidious at ensuring the waste goes where it should. Thus a lot of this plastic we think we&rsquo;ve sent for recycling actually ends up littering the environment, particularly the sea, anyway.</p>
<p>The author cites <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922003512?via%3Dihub">a model</a> that suggests that 6,000 of the 37,000 tons of plastic packaging the Netherlands exports each year, mostly to Asia, actually ends up in the marine environment.</p>
<p>Apparently British landfills are fairly good at keeping in what&rsquo;s deposited in them, if nothing else. So perhaps the real choice we have is between putting waste plastic in the recycle bin knowing that a good amount of it will end up polluting the sea anyway, vs putting it in the general waste bin knowing that it&rsquo;ll be stuck alongside vast mass of landfill forever - but that&rsquo;s a relatively &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and contained place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure which the best option is! Both the afore-mentioned book and this article reinforce it&rsquo;s far more effective to reduce the amount of plastic that&rsquo;s created in the first place, as opposed to keep making it with the hope that it&rsquo;ll be recycled.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473574922">A Book Of Secrets</a> by Derren Brown 📚.</p>
<p>Philosophical meanderings on how one can frame the ups and downs of life so as to best cope with the journey. It extolls the development of a universal sense of absurdity and melancholy, alongside an appreciation of the growth that coming up against friction can bring. And that there&rsquo;s really no point in trying to hide the facets of ourselves we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think it may be especiallly poignant for anyone going through something like a mid-life crisis - if nothing else to understand that even extremely famous and successful people have the same feelings of doubt, frustration and maybe even horror that the rest of us do. It&rsquo;s a very universal experience.</p>

<img src="uploads/2022/693fd6caf3.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="" />
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering why it feels like he&rsquo;s facing the wrong way, then it turns out that&rsquo;s actually tradition. Each time we get a new monarch, the coin design flips such that they alternate from facing left to right and so on. We just haven&rsquo;t had a new monarch within almost anyone&rsquo;s living memory.</p>
<p>This has been the case since the 1600s, only broken at the request of King Edward VIII. Although even that was mainly a theoretical breach for anyone outside of specialist coin collectors, because no coins got into general circulation before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication_of_Edward_VIII">he abdicated</a>.</p>
<p>This also explains why Queen Elizabeth <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/whats-on/whats-on-news/queens-head-faces-right-coins-17520861">faced left on stamps but right on coins</a>. The convention for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stamps has been for the monarch to always face left, whereas she happened to be on the looking-right phase of the coin schedule.</p>
<p>Likewise kings typically <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-09-30/the-subtle-ways-the-new-king-charles-coin-will-be-different-from-the-queens">do not wear crowns in their coin portraits</a>, whereas queens do.</p>

			 <p>Mortgage payments look to be one of the next crises the UK is going to have to stare into the existential void of, or do something about.</p>
<p>Not content with folk being unable to afford food to eat or energy to heat, it seems like housing may be the next to go. Even for those people who are rich or lucky enough to be mortgaged home owners - in many places <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-its-more-difficult-for-young-people-to-buy-a-house-now-than-it-was-fifty-years-ago-12537254">it&rsquo;s been nearly impossible</a> for first time buyers to get onto the housing ladder in the first place.</p>
<p>As the British economy appears to destroy itself in reaction to the Conservative&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/23/kwarteng-accused-of-reckless-mini-budget-for-the-rich-as-pound-crashes">bewildering and reckless mini-budget</a>, the Bank of England has felt compelled to raise interest rates. This has many consequences, but of note here is the fact that many mortgages are directly linked to the BoE interest rate. Those that aren&rsquo;t are likely influenced by it, at least at the time of taking out the loan.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate">Bank of England&rsquo;s web page</a> shows how the interest rate has changed over the past decade.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/d16be7e3ad.png" width="600" height="335" alt="" />
<p>So it&rsquo;s been very low, under than 1% for most of the decade, but has already shot up to more than double that figure recently. But that&rsquo;s not where it&rsquo;s likely to stop.  The markets are apparently pricing in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england">an expected rate of 6%</a> for next year.</p>
<p>This certainly isn&rsquo;t historically unprecedented - the rate was last 6% back in 1999, and it was more than double that a decade before. But people have obviously been taking out mortgages - and companies have been offering them - based on the situation in contemporary times rather than the state of the world 20 years ago. Even if a consumer  did proactively try and integrate future interest rate considerations into their mortgage decision they wouldn&rsquo;t have been saved; just a few months ago the projected interest rate for next year was just a quarter of what it seems like it may turn out to be.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/22/what-does-the-banks-interest-rate-hike-mean-for-peoples-financesr">about 2.2 million people on variable rate mortgages</a>, who are likely to be affected in the short term. About 3 times as many people currently hold fixed rate mortgages so are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the short term, but as soon as they come to the end of their fixed rate - usually 2 or 5 years after they took the mortgage out -  they will end up in the same disaster-laden boat.</p>
<p>The consequential differences in the monthly payments homeowners will be required to make are not small! Unfortunately a rise of 1 percentage point in the bank rate doesn&rsquo;t mean your payments get 1% larger. For mortgages that follow the Bank of England rate, the interest rate relates to that of your debt. I&rsquo;m sure many of us have been schooled about the miracle of compound interest when it comes to savings. Unfortunately the same applies to debt.</p>
<p>Various articles have given some example calculations. A tweet from economist Samuel Tombs calculated that the average household looking to refinance a 2 year fix next year would need to find £627 extra a month.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If mortgage rates rise to 6%—as implied by markets’ current expectations for Bank Rate—the average household refinancing a 2yr fixed rate mortgage in the first half of 2023 will see *monthly* repayments jump to £1,490, from £863. Many simply won’t be able to afford this (1/2) <a href="https://t.co/hkoZCcSfjJ">pic.twitter.com/hkoZCcSfjJ</a></p>&mdash; Samuel Tombs (@samueltombs) <a href="https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/1574429056593977344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Others examples quoted by <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/sinking-pound-sterling-mortgage-debt-interest-rates-123320628.html">Yahoo Finance</a> include someone with a £140k mortgage that went from 2.25% to 6% would need to pay an additional £270 a month.</p>
<p>You can choose your own example using one of the many mortgage calculators, such as the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator/">one from MoneySavingExpert</a>.</p>
<p>With that for example you can see that  you&rsquo;d taken out £150k over 25 years at say 1.5%, that&rsquo;s a monthly payment of £600. The same borrowing at next year&rsquo;s expected interest rate of 6% would cost you £967 a month.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the state of affairs is in such disarray that <a href="https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/mortgages/which-lenders-have-removed-their-mortgages-thus-far/">985 mortgage products were withdrawn</a> from sale overnight, with some banks and building societies entirely stopping offering mortgages to new customers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Under the Trump administration, the US instantiated policies aimed to reduce the number of refugee and asylum seekers settling in their country between 2017 and 2020.</p>
<p>It seems like the policies <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/27/under-trump-us-no-longer-leads-world-on-refugee-protections/">were fairly &ldquo;successful&rdquo;</a>, with a decrease in annual US refugee arrivals <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/economic-and-fiscal-effects-united-states-reduced-numbers-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.pdf">by 86% between 2016 and 2020</a>, alongside a drop in successful applications for asylum of <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/economic-and-fiscal-effects-united-states-reduced-numbers-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.pdf">around 68% between 2017 and 2019</a>. I don&rsquo;t know enough about the subject to know how much of this was down to the policies themselves, but the numbers certainly went in the direction the leadership wanted.</p>
<p>However, contrary to many lay-people&rsquo;s intuitions, there&rsquo;s a reasonable consensus amongst economists that, in their role as &ldquo;economic actors&rdquo;, immigrants are on average net positive for the receiving country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All are consumers, most are (or become) workers, and many are (or become) investors. All incur fiscal costs by using public services directly or indirectly, and all generate fiscal revenue either directly or indirectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/38/3/449/6701682?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">A recently published paper</a> by Michael Clemens examines the specific effect of  the afore-mentioned decrease in asylum and refugee admissions along these lines.  It concludes that the the reduction in admissions now costs the US economy more than $9.1 billion per year, and the government itself has lost out more than $2 billion. These costs will keep accruing as time goes on because the population that would have generated this extra economic activity is simply not present.</p>
<p>His model suggests that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;relative to 2019 levels, a 10 percent reduction in refugee resettlement to the United States likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than $1.4 billion, and a loss to public coffers (federal, state, and local) of more than $310 million, cumulatively over the  subsequent five years.</p>
<p>Turning to asylum seekers: A 10 percent reduction in affirmative and defensive asylum seekers likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than $8.9 billion, and a loss to public coffers of more than $1.5 billion, cumulatively over the subsequent five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst I certainly don&rsquo;t think the primary driver of asylum policy should be economic - a basic moral concern for other people should surely be paramount - the fact that imposing barriers to this form of migration imposes serious and potentially permanent economic costs on one&rsquo;s own country seems like something that should be present in the consciousness of the public and the decision makers.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/18/if-disney-somehow.html">If Disney did ruin The Little Mermaid then it was 33 years ago</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/18/if-disney-somehow.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-18 16:26:48 &#43;0000">Sep 18, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film &ldquo;The Little Mermaid&rdquo;.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-wPm99PF9U" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Of course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. As noted in a <a href="https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid">recent edition</a> of <a href="https://www.readtpa.com/">The Present Age&rsquo;s </a>newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don&rsquo;t like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising, not least because the <a href="https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8">same rants and raves happened</a> upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they&rsquo;d already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of &ldquo;using AI&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/">convert a still from the trailer</a> from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, &ldquo;over for wokecels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/">Fear of a Black Hobbit</a>&rdquo; is right in saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;can you make a film that isn&rsquo;t <em>about</em> politics?&rdquo; - of course you can. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine many films that aren&rsquo;t touched by society and politics one way or another.</p>
<p>If what is really meant is &ldquo;I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago&rdquo; then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can&rsquo;t be interpreted &ldquo;politically&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it.</p>
<p>If one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus">Jesus has been portrayed</a> over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‘correct’ one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">they likely did exist</a> as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.</p>
<p>On which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid&rsquo;s casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I&rsquo;m sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We&rsquo;re not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.</p>
<p>Secondly, the colour of Ariel&rsquo;s skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It&rsquo;s more about whether she has a fish tail or not.</p>
<p>Where skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you’re trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible. Switching the races of the actors in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/">BlackkKlansman</a> would be pretty nonsensical given its topic and basis in real life. The story of a fictional creature living in a fictional world where their salient experience is dependent on whether they have a fish tail or human legs does not have this limiting factor.</p>
<p>In reality, even a writer who wants to tell stories about race has many degrees of freedom. Science fiction for example contains many stories about social prejudice and discrimination paralleling racism but set in an entirely different looking and behaving world populated with distant aliens.  Experimenting with other identities can work similarly - Naomi Alderman&rsquo;s famous book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power">The Power</a>&rdquo; explores a future where women become a physical threat to men, as opposed to the current world where the opposite is usually true.</p>
<p>Next up, well, Black mermaids are nothing new even within the canon of Disney-specific Little Mermaid productions. Disney has had them for three decades. You&rsquo;ve somewhat missed the boat on umm&hellip;&ldquo;proving&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Introducing Gabriella, from 1992&rsquo;s Disney&rsquo;s Little Mermaid TV series:</p>
<figure><img src="/uploads/2022/65b44cb50a.png"
         alt="Image from the Mermaid Wiki"/><figcaption>
            <p>Image from the <a href="https://mermaid.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella">Mermaid Wiki</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unlike most Disney mermaids, Gabriella was actually based on a real person, albeit not one with a tail.  Her design was inspired by 2 year-old Gabriella Bommino who unfortunately died of leukaemia so young, but was already a Little Mermaid superfan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t if this choice caused any consternation in 1992 to be honest. I hope not. But Twitter and YouTube weren&rsquo;t a thing back then so perhaps it was more containable if it existed at all.</p>
<p>Moving on: is there really a danger of ruining the purity (?) of the Little Mermaid by &ldquo;introducing politics&rdquo;? As noted above, so many - perhaps all - stories are already touched or contextualised by politics and society. But it seems to me that the Little Mermaid is particularly easy to interpret using political and social metaphors. Many people have done so, years before last week&rsquo;s trailer came out.</p>
<p>Whilst some may now find aspects of Disney&rsquo;s original 1989 film interpretation of The Little Mermaid <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-little-mermaid_b_1694342">problematic</a>, the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/little-mermaid-was-way-more-subversive-you-realized-180973464/">Smithsonian Magazine wrote</a> in some detail about the political subversion embedded within it at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last thing Americans would expect from Disney was a critique of patriarchy, but sure enough, Ashman’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em> is a gutsy film about gender and identity—a far cry from the staid Disney catalog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenika Cruz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/the-little-mermaid-at-25-and-the-evolving-definition-of-strong-female/382581/">writing in the Atlantic</a> saw it as a &ldquo;stepping stone&rdquo; for Disney from a set of animations with few female leads (and those that did feature were often asleep for most of the film - think Snow White or Sleeping Beauty) to the more rounded, well-developed female cartoon stars of recent years.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, there has been many an interpretation of the original story, for example as an allegory for growing up, as a commentary on identity or a metaphor for gender relations. After all, poor repressed Ariel believes the only way she can be happy is to marry a rich man, so feels compelled to change her appearance, giving up her treasured voice in an effort to do so. I haven&rsquo;t got access to the essay, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid#Themes_and_interpretations">Wikipedia</a> describes <a href="https://experts.arizona.edu/en/publications/split-skins-female-agency-and-bodily-mutilation-in-the-little-mer">Susan White&rsquo;s interpretation of the story</a> as the &ldquo;difficult liminal passage of the girl into the order of speech and social symbolism (power, politics, and agency) which is symbolically understood as masculine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is even more salient when we remember that the Disney movie in many ways does not actually reflect the original story. If Disney is to be held at fault for changing the original then perhaps it&rsquo;d make a little more sense to be cross at them for entirely changing the ending and, to some people, the whole point of the story 33 years ago. For the &ldquo;anti-wokers&rdquo;, surely casting a person that doesn&rsquo;t look exactly like your mental image of Ariel is nothing compared making up a whole new soppy ending, perhaps fearing that the snowflake audience can&rsquo;t cope with the original.</p>
<p>For people, like me as of 2 days ago, who don&rsquo;t know the original story, brace yourself - it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>
<p>First we discover that, unlike the story&rsquo;s humans, mermaids are mere creatures; they don&rsquo;t have souls. Human souls go to heaven for eternity when they die. Mermaids simply turn into foam and cease to exist. As well as questing for the love of the handsome prince, what Ariel is battling for is to complete herself with a soul.</p>
<p>The witch still gives Ariel the magic turn-tail-into-legs potion in exchange for her voice. But in the original, drinking it is physically agonising. Walking on her resulting legs feels like walking on sharp knives from that point on.</p>
<p>The conditionality is also more severe. If Ariel can&rsquo;t make the prince love her then the day after he marries someone else, Ariel will die. In that case she will also never have become a full human, so will die soulless, vanishing from existence entirely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the prince marries someone else.</p>
<p>But all is not lost; Ariel&rsquo;s sisters negotiate with the witch, swapping their lovely hair for a knife they give to Ariel. Ariel must use this knife to murder the prince. Only when his blood drips on her feet the witch will let her return to her original mermaid life. Grim.</p>
<p>Despite the personal consequences, she can&rsquo;t bring herself to do this so commits suicide, throwing herself into the sea and dissolving into foam as expected. But at the last minute she&rsquo;s kind of saved: rather than vanishing into nothingness forever she&rsquo;s been turned into a spirit - a &ldquo;daughter of the air&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s still a glimmer of hope for her to get into heaven, but for now she&rsquo;s stuck in purgatory for 300 years, and must try and prove herself worthy by doing good deeds for mankind.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been something of an anti-monarchist every since I can remember, primarily based on the general idea that holding the privilege and powers associated with the office, both explicit and implicit should not be something that someone gets based on who their parents happened to be and whether their ancestors won a battle hundreds of years ago. There are also convincing arguments that the institution is expensive, unaccountable, and so on.</p>
<p>To me, the UK has really just been lucky that for so long we&rsquo;ve had a queen, that at least as far as I know (which is not all that far),  in recent times has been a committed, principled and dutiful holder of the post, not being unduly meddlesome or inflammatory. Quite the opposite, you&rsquo;ll not find too many hot takes on the <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily">Royal Family&rsquo;s Twitter account</a>. It feels sad that she has left us, irrespective of whether or not the institution itself is valid. But it&rsquo;s a bit of a risky proposition to say that all future holders of the crown will be of a similar type.</p>
<p>The usual &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; argument I have heard about in favour of the British monarchy is, sure, they cost money, but they also generate a lot via for instance tourism. I haven&rsquo;t looked into it in any detail, but given most tourists don&rsquo;t get to meet the queen or king themselves, I wonder how we go about separating the specific impact of the power structure of the monarchy and the people involved from the more available parts of the associated tourism; the fancy buildings, soldiers dressed up in unusual costumes, museums full of jewelry, the history and mythology and so on, all of which could exist without a formal monarch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ianleslie.substack.com/p/being-the-queen">recent edition</a> of<a href="https://ianleslie.substack.com/"> Ian Leslie&rsquo;s newsletter</a> provided a take I&rsquo;d not really considered before. It seems inspired in part from <a href="https://twitter.com/jhallwood/status/1568149860628533248">an essay</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Attlee">Clement Atlee</a>  - yes, that same socialist Prime Minister, beloved by some of the British left, no flag-waving conservative here! - who wrote that &ldquo;I have never been a republican even in theory, and certainly not in practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie (and Atlee) note that, as irrational and hierarchical as the system of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> may be, several countries that are widely acknowledged to have <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3043576/the-10-countries-with-the-highest-national-well-being">high levels</a> of both wellbeing and relative equality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy#List_of_current_constitutional_monarchies">have one</a> - think of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. That&rsquo;s not to say this style of monarchy <em>causes</em> these good outcomes, but it clearly doesn&rsquo;t prevent them, and perhaps may even be positively associated with them.</p>
<p>Why do they appear to work well? Leslie argues that the unavoidable irrationality of bestowing power and finery upon someone predicated solely on who their parents are may be  part of the attraction - &ldquo;they speak to the heart as well as the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humans are not purely rational beings, and perhaps the &ldquo;sentimental loyalty&rdquo; humans are prone to is better to be absorbed by a monarch than left to be picked up by the leader of a faction, with Atlee citing Hitler, Mussolini and de Gaulle as contenders. To the extent that a constitutional monarchy isn&rsquo;t the obvious centre of day-to-day power in practice, perhaps it&rsquo;s safer and more uniting to have irrational sentimentality directed that way.</p>
<p>The fact that the queen didn&rsquo;t have to fight for votes in an election (or, to at least some extent popularity in the media) gave her the ability to not become part of any major argument. There are plenty of people who aren&rsquo;t a fan of the monarchy in principle, but nonetheless the queen did seem to be able to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/sky-high-public-approval-for-the-queen-ahead-of-platinum-jubilee">unite swathes of people</a> in a way that it&rsquo;s almost inconceivable a leader of a more &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; institution such as a political party could. This may be a particular property of some kings and queens more than others - after all support for Queen Elizabeth was substantially higher than the support for Britain remaining a monarchy at the same time -  but it almost by definition cannot be a property of anyone involved in a close-run battle for electoral success.</p>
<p>The US of course famously has no monarch, having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">torn themselves away</a> from the British one in 1776, but to many external observers seems to be riven by a particularly polarised politics. Certain presidential candidates appear to attract high amounts of almost conditionless blind-seeming loyalty from their supporters, as sentimental and irrational as anything one might feel for a monarch.</p>
<p>Leslie also considers that the constitutional monarchy gives us a way to express positive sentiment for our fellow country-people. Not that we don&rsquo;t understand that they live an incredibly privileged and unusual live, and sometimes we may quite legitimately feel jealous or resentful of that. But at the end of the day we can acknowledge their common humanity. As a human family they proxy for all the country&rsquo;s families. The widespread doting over whoever the latest royal child is - who is after all just one of the hundreds of children born each day in the UK - being a reminder that we could and should feel love all those other children too.</p>

			 <p>I see the queue of people waiting their turn to see Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s coffin - now known across the internet as The Queue - now has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queue">its own Wikipedia page</a>. Although perhaps not for long; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Queue">the discussion</a> as to whether it should be deleted for not being notable enough for its own page is ongoing.</p>
<p>By reading the debate, I learned that by deliberately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/13/toilets-and-first-aid-on-five-mile-queue-route-to-view-queens-coffin">limiting its length to 5 miles</a> the queue controllers are preventing it from reaching the length of the queue for the grave of the current world record holder for the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/65207-largest-funerals">largest funeral gathering</a>. This was the funeral of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._N._Annadurai">Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai</a> in India, whose funeral was apparently attended by 15 million people, with a queue of 6 miles.</p>
<p>Earlier today the Queen Elizabeth queue maxed out its allocated length, with wait times expected to be at least 14 hours. The Queue <a href="https://twitter.com/DCMS/status/1570696999372214272">was thus temporarily closed</a> to new entrants. Cue<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2022/sep/16/queen-elizabeth-ii-lying-in-state-westminster-hall-king-charles-iii-mourners-queue-london-live-news-latest-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-632442fa8f0836766296d35a#block-632442fa8f0836766296d35a"> the queue for The Queue</a>.</p>
<p>For people that don&rsquo;t mind spoilers, a live stream of the destination of the queue <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-62902778">is available from the BBC</a>. Although I find the coverage a little creepy because the camera often focuses in on individual mourners rather than the coffin.</p>
<p>I hope that they have been made aware that their expression of sorrow is being transmitted to the world at large. For me, that would surely take something away from what I&rsquo;d expect to be a solemn, personal and perhaps emotional moment.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307745439">How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS</a> by David France 📚.</p>
<p>A book about a global pandemic that appears to have been dramatically mismanaged at first with some appearances by Dr Fauci seems all too contemporary. But this one is actually about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS pandemic</a>, primarily in the US.</p>
<p>There was of course a staggering death count - an <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids">estimated 40 million lives</a> lost so far - with all the associated heart-breaking pain and misery, physical and mental, for those who caught the disease and those who loved them.</p>
<p>But of course what was particularly insidious in this case was that the large majority of those afflicted with the deadly infection at the start of the pandemic were gay men. And this was a population that the extraordinarily prejudiced mainstream opinion at the time was all too happy to disparage, disregard, ignore or blame.  The world just seem didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A large part of the book surrounds how in the end activist groups, often largely composed of people very ill with AIDS themselves, simply had to keep fighting for years - sometimes to the extent of basically infiltrating government or medical research organisations - until the government, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, media and indeed the rest of society couldn&rsquo;t ignore the devastation any more.</p>

<p>Polio has no known cure. Whilst most infected people don&rsquo;t develop noticable symptoms, it <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/poliovirus-in-london-wastewater-is-it-a-cause-for-concern#Quick-facts-about-polio">can cause outcomes as harmful as paralysis</a> in some patients, a fraction of which may die due to paralysis of their breathing muscles. It was once <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/polio-20th-century-epidemic">known as infantile paralysis</a>, due to children&rsquo;s heightened vulnerability to the disease.</p>
<p>Only one human case had been detected as of four days ago, but it&rsquo;s been seen in the city&rsquo;s wastewater and become enough of an issue that the mayor <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62857112">declared a state of emergency</a>. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0913-polio.html">has confirmed</a> that the US should now be considered a country with circulating poliovirus again, after 43 years of polio-free status.</p>
<p>One driving factor is likely the fact that polio vaccination rates are really not very high in some places any more, as shown in <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/polio-vaccination-coverage-by-zip.pdf">this map</a> from the City of New York&rsquo;s website. Nearly half of Williamsburg&rsquo;s young children haven&rsquo;t been fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Over here in the UK we&rsquo;re hardly immune - polio has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/23/uk-polio-virus-london-sewage/">detected in our sewage</a> too, although we don&rsquo;t seem to have found any reported transmission within the community.

<p>The theory is that accessible mobile phones allowed the black market trade to be conducted and coordinated privately by phone. Customers could be met at discreet locations rather than trade needing to be plied directly on the street in fixed locations. This reduced street-level turf battles between gangs who funded their activities via drug sales in ways that frequently involved violence, as well as potentially &ldquo;democratising&rdquo; the market to allow other types of sellers in.</p>

			 <p>Traditionally, we might have expected the UK&rsquo;s young people to be more liberal or left-wing than their older counterparts on most topics - see for example which party various age groups voted for in the 2019 general election <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/wl0r2q1sm4/Results_HowBritainVoted_2019_w.pdf">according to Yougov&rsquo;s poll</a>. But from a recent report it seems like younger folk are not huge fans of a rather fundamental aspect of liberal democracies - the democracy part.</p>
<p>A poll conducted by J.L. Partners on May 2022 for <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kids-arent-alright-democracy.pdf">a report</a> published by <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/">Onward</a>, a conservative thinktank, on a sample of UK respondents weighted to be nationally representative on several demographic factors found that young people are not great fans of democracy.</p>
<p>Starting off with a chart shown on page 20 of the report:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/0c460ccca1.png" width="578" height="415" alt="" />
<p>We see the younger age brackets having fairly low net support when asked whether a democracy was a a “very good”, “fairly good”, “fairly bad”, or “very bad” way of running the country. Around a quarter of 18-34 year olds felt that democracy is a bad way of governing the country (the equivalent figure for over-55s is 8%).</p>
<p>A similar net proportion of the young thought some kind of technocracy was a good way to run a country as felt the same about democracies.</p>
<p>Admittedly life in the UK doesn&rsquo;t exactly feel well-governed to many of us at present, to put it politely -  so perhaps that&rsquo;s fairly understandable. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/10/young-adults-loss-of-faith-in-uk-democracy-survey">different survey</a>, carried out by IPPR found that only 19% of UK&rsquo;s 18-24 year olds felt democracy has served them well, vs 55% who say badly. What surprised me a bit more was the support for some of the rather more authoritarian options.</p>
<p>There was a net 23% support for &ldquo;a strongman who can ignore parliament&rdquo; as a good way to run the country in 18-34 year olds, vs a negative -42% in &gt; 55 year olds.  60% of the youngest group, 18-24 year olds thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Even the rather radical &ldquo;put the army in charge&rdquo; only <em>just</em> got a negative support rating in younger cohorts - net disapproval of 8% in 18-34 year olds vs -74% in &gt;55 year olds.  44% of the 18-24 year olds were favourable towards  this type of rule.</p>
<p>So is this a young person thing? Maybe despite being liberal in many other domains young folk always think strongman or army rule is a decent option? As well as not really making intuitive sense, it also isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/38e184282b.png" width="545" height="385" alt="" />
<p>To be honest, I find the even the agreement level in the &ldquo;good years&rdquo; surprisingly high - and just look at the 2019 results! -  but clearly something changed such that the younger folks still think relying on a single strong leader is a good way forward.</p>
<p>Likewise a pro army rule position has just gotten more and more popular over time, especially in younger cohorts.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/00c3dfb297.png" width="538" height="371" alt="" />
<p>Based on this admittedly fairly small time series, it doesn&rsquo;t look to be a general age effect.</p>
<p>Some of the factors the report suggests are linked to this support for authoritarian rule include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Socio-economic circumstances, with the least secure 20% of voters being more than twice as likely as the most secure to say that democracy is a bad way to govern the country.</li>
<li>Social connection, with people with more friends, or more diverse friend circles, being less likely to support authoritarian rule.</li>
<li>Political leanings, with socially conservative young people being much more likely than liberal folk to support the strong man or army rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of that makes intuitive sense at least on the dislike of democracy side of things. If you live in a democracy and you have a particularly difficult life, why would you feel like it&rsquo;s a good way to run things?</p>
<p>Thinking one form of rule is a good way to govern a country of course doesn&rsquo;t rule out also thinking others are. For example, young people who report generally trusting other people are both more likely to support democracy than those who don&rsquo;t, (81% vs 69%) but also more like to support strongman leaders (72% vs 51%). In fact a higher proportion of young people who say democracy is a good way to run the country also support the authoritarian methods of rule than those who don&rsquo;t. Perhaps some people just think that there <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a good way to run a country?</p>
<p>The report authors believe that the drivers of general detachment that are leading to this and many other negative effects on young people can be summarised as being the narrowness of their social networks, overprotective parenting, the treadmill of modern work and the online culture.</p>

The way it works over here is that the government issues a cap, which limits the maximum amount the energy supply companies can charge consumers. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll look in more detail as to how this is calculated in future but to be extremely simplistic about it at present, the majority of the increase is down to the wholesale cost of energy to the supplier, which is presently very high. In fact a bunch of them <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58732683">went bankrupt last year</a>.</p>
<p>A year ago the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/09/energy-bills-price-freeze-cost-of-living-government-liz-truss-/">cap worked out at £1,277</a> for the average UK consumer. Earlier this year it had already painfully zoomed up to £1,971. In October, had it been worked out in the standard way, it would be not-far-off-doubled to £3,549.</p>
<p>The Government has tried to mitigate some of the obvious impending disaster by putting a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-bills-support/energy-bills-support-factsheet-8-september-2022">price guarantee</a>&rdquo; on it such that the average consumer will be paying £2,500. So a lot less than £3,549 thankfully, but still substantially more than it ever has been.</p>
<p>One thing to understand about the energy cap is that it is not&hellip;a cap. Or at least not an overall one. You will always pay more if you use more electricity. The quoted cap is on the cost it would be for an average consumer. This translates down to a cap on the standing cost and unit price. If you have a big or energy inefficient house you may well pay substantially more than £2,500. So even if you manage to save up enough money to pay the £2,500, you still shouldn&rsquo;t go wild from a financial, let alone an environmental, point of view.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are apparently no tariffs that are appreciably below the maximum permitted cost to switch to, per <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/-are-there-any-cheap--fixed-energy-deals-currently-worth-it--/">Martin Lewis</a>. So most of the levers we can pull at an individual level are about cutting down on the usage of electricity. Not necessarily a bad thing for other reasons too, including environmental, if it can be done without impacting people&rsquo;s wellbeing. But that&rsquo;s a big and often unrealistic if.</p>
<p>Some people, myself included, are billed at a different cost in the day vs in the night, aka economy 7, in which case perhaps retiming your electricity consumption will help. Although it seems weirdly difficult to learn what counts as day or night unless your electric meter is labelled or you have a smart meter - it&rsquo;s not the same for everyone. In the end I just asked my electricity supplier. And will attempt to do my washing after 10pm from here on in!</p>
<h2 id="what-devices-should-we-focus-on-to-reduce-our-electricity-consumption-and-hence-costs">What devices should we focus on to reduce our electricity consumption and hence costs?</h2>
<p>The general rule seems to be that most modern electronics <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/1566694684289818625?s=20&amp;t=uEByLd9cUcNZehi390sNjg">don&rsquo;t cost a whole lot</a> - modern bulbs, LCD televisions, charging your phone etc. It&rsquo;s not <em>zero</em>, so there&rsquo;s a perhaps a little potential saving you can do there. But unfortunately the big deals tend to be appliances that relate to <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/1566694686974447618?s=20&amp;t=uEByLd9cUcNZehi390sNjg">heating or eating</a>, both of which are fairly essential.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-02/price-breakdown-how-much-will-it-cost-to-run-appliances-in-uk-energy-crisis">Bloomberg</a> had a nice chart which combined the energy consumption of the average device of a given type with the average usage time to show the cost. Now the actual costs shown on it  will be a bit higher than reality I believe because the £2500 price guarantee hadn&rsquo;t been announced when they published this - but still the &ldquo;big circles are the expensive ones&rdquo; idea holds.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/68bf4105e3.png" width="600" height="854" alt="" />
<p>The washing machine cost I understand to be highly dependent on the temperature of the wash. If you can wash at a lower temperature you&rsquo;ll save electricity. I&rsquo;ve started trying 30 degrees for everything.</p>
<p>All heating-related ones are clearly the big drain. With regards to saving on central heating itself, I&rsquo;ve seen tips around the internet that concentrate on heating the people rather than the entire house if times are real tough. For instance you can see in the above that using electric blankets is way, way cheaper than central heating. I&rsquo;ve also seen suggestions for hot water bottles.</p>
<p>To get a more precise personal estimate, there are also energy cost calculators, like <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/">sust-it</a> where you can <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/energy-calculator.php">type in the energy consumption</a> of your appliance and the time you want to use it for to get a cost estimate. It also has guides for specific types of appliances e.g. <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/vacuum-cleaners.php">vacuum cleaners</a> or <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/microwave-ovens.php">microwaves</a>. It also allows you to compare models of appliances based on energy efficiency if you&rsquo;re in the market for something new.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-dry-my-clothes">How should I dry my clothes?</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/energy-calculator.php">general calculator</a> to help me think about clothes drying on occasions we have too much laundry to hang around the house and the weather won&rsquo;t allow the washing line to do the trick. I used Martin Lewis' estimate of 34p per kWh, found <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/09/energy-bills-price-freeze-cost-of-living-government-liz-truss-/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our washing machine also has drying functionality. Whilst I can find that the appliance is overall energy rating B, I can&rsquo;t quickly figure out how to know what that means specifically for the dryer component in watts. I&rsquo;d say it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete.
The Bloomberg chart above suggested £1.95 per load. Trying to work backwards from <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/washer-dryers/article/energy-efficient-washer-dryers-aGNaQ0N58yv6">Which&rsquo;s figures for the cheapest washer dryer</a> I get to about £1.21 (and I&rsquo;m sure ours isn&rsquo;t the cheapest.) <a href="https://www.inspirecleanenergy.com/blog/sustainable-living/how-much-electricity-dryer">This page</a> suggests the average dryer is about 3000 kwH which for 1.5 hours would be £1.53. This site has says a tumble dryer cycle is 4.5 kWH, which would equate to the same.</p>
<p>We also have a dehumidifier that works reasonably well, but may need leaving on the entire day, let&rsquo;s say 8 hours. It has two settings, I usually use the clothes drying option which I assume is the high one, 725W. That&rsquo;s mean it&rsquo;d cost £1.97. Using the lower one would knock it down to £1.14.</p>
<p>There are also heated drying racks out there. In the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sun-selects/15821170/best-heated-clothes-airers/">Sun&rsquo;s rundown</a> of &ldquo;the best&rdquo; ones, the one they prefer overall  is 230W. It seems that there&rsquo;s great variance in how long clothes take to dry on them, but let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;d take between 5 and 10 hours. That&rsquo;d imply a cost of 39p - 78p.</p>
<p>So from that I guess there&rsquo;s not much benefit in using the dehumidifier for long periods over the tumble drying facility of the washing machine. The heated rack sounds a more economical option, except that I&rsquo;d have to buy it in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="the-black-mirror-option">The Black Mirror option</h2>
<p>Seeing as in 2022 we continue to inhabit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror">Black Mirror</a> Timeline there is of course one other option. Exploitation via light entertainment! Here&rsquo;s a much shared clip of a phone-in TV contest gameshow where the top prize on offer was &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pay your electricity bills for 4 months&rdquo;, the concept of which was fairly <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/09/this-morning-spin-to-win-energy-bills-competition-black-mirror">condemned by many folk</a> out there as entirely dystopian. There is a touch of one of the early Black Mirror episodes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Million_Merits">Fifteen Million Merits</a>, about it to be fair.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/how-your-expectations.html">How your expectations affect the way your body processes food - summary of a chapter from The Expectation Effect</a></h1>

			 <p>I <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/finished-reading-the.html">recently read</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250827630">The Expectation Effect</a>, a fascinating book looking at how what you expect influences what actually happens with regard to your body and life.</p>
<p>Below is a fairly detailed summary of chapter 6 (prioritised as being most potentially relevant to my work). I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be talking a lot more about the rest of this book in future. But for now, the main topic of this chapter was how your beliefs and expectations influence how your body and brain react to what you eat - potentially useful knowledge for anyone interested in healthy eating.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our brain&rsquo;s predictive processing means that our <em>expectation</em> of what nutrients a food contains directly affects how our body responds to that food, including our:</p>
<ul>
<li>digestion, i.e. the breaking down and absorption of nutrients in the gut.</li>
<li>metabolism, i.e. how we process the food to power our cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we believe we&rsquo;re eating fewer calories than we really are, our body responds to that belief. The brain induces a deprivation mindset, and we feel less satiated, more hungry and inclined to expend less energy in order to preserve fat stores.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that appetite is controlled in part by activity in the digestive system - bottom-up information. However the brain also seems to need top-down info e.g. memory and expectation, to make sense of the digestive information input in order to create the appropriate feelings of hunger or satiation.</p>
<p>Altering how we think about food can change the brain&rsquo;s assessment of what it has eaten.</p>
<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>A patient who had lost the ability to form new memories, was asked to rate how hungry he was on a scale of 0 -100. He rated his hunger similarly both before and after consuming a meal.  After two meals in a row he felt only partly satiated.</p>
<p>This suggests that our appetite is not solely governed by &ldquo;fullness signals&rdquo; from the stomach. It&rsquo;s also influenced by our memory of what we ate.</p>
<p>Milder forgetfulness is also associated with over-eating.</p>
<p>In an experiment asking students to taste test cookies, they consumed 45% less if they had first been prompted to remember their lunch by noting down what they&rsquo;d eaten.</p>
<p>Working, watching TV or using the internet whilst eating may create a distraction that impairs our memory of what we ate, leading to eating larger meals and more snacks afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="expectation">Expectation</h2>
<p>The sense of fullness and satisfaction participants had from eating either 300ml or 500ml of soup was largely based on how much soup they thought they&rsquo;d eaten, rather than how much they actually had.</p>
<p>Participants who believed they&rsquo;d eaten a 3 egg omelette felt more satiated than those who thought they&rsquo;d eaten a 1 egg omelette, even though they&rsquo;d eaten the same amount.</p>
<p>Patients who believed that they&rsquo;ve undergone obesity-related surgery, e.g. stomach stapling or gastric balloon, experienced 70% of the benefits of the operation (reduced appetite, higher weightloss) even though the actual surgery never took place.</p>
<h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>
<p>The presentation of manufactured foods can disrupt our brain&rsquo;s ability to assess its contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain remembers eating a lot less after drinking a small bottled smoothie vs eating the equivalent portions of fruit, giving the expectation of hunger later in the day.</li>
<li>Several studies show that the exact same food leads to lower satiety when it is labelled &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as opposed to when it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;hearty&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The more viscous a drink is the more filling we expect it to be, and the higher our physiological response.</li>
<li>Iron absorption from meals that have been pureed were much lower than the same meal presented in its standard form.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; snacks may be counterproductive - participants given a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; chocolate bar were hungrier afterwards than those given nothing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beliefs">Beliefs</h3>
<p>When presented with a choice of 2 items such as a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger and a 8.5oz grilled ocean code, most people think the burger has more calories even though they&rsquo;re about equal, over or underestimating the true value by up to 50%. People who have greater mismatches in their estimates are on average heavier.</p>
<p>People who agree more strongly with statements such as &ldquo;There is usually a trade-off between healthiness and tastiness&rdquo; tend to have higher BMIs.</p>
<h2 id="mechanisms">Mechanisms</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin">Ghrelin</a> is a hormone secreted by the stomach when it&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p>High levels induce our body to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower its metabolic resting rate, burning less energy.</li>
<li>store body fat.</li>
<li>feel lethargic, so we don&rsquo;t waste energy on exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants who had drank a milkshake marketed as indulgent saw lower ghrelin levels, as expected after a meal. But those who drank the same milkshake presented as healthy and light, saw very little change in ghrelin.</p>
<p>Brain areas associated with energy regulation are also affected. People given a low-calorie drink labelled as a treat had a stronger hypothalamus response when it was labelled as a &ldquo;treat&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;,</p>
<p>Expectations also affect the movement of food in the gut and our insulin responses.</p>
<h2 id="the-environment">The environment</h2>
<p>Our environment reinforces the idea that healthy foods are less satisfying. An analysis of 26 American chain restaurants that offer &ldquo;healthy eating&rdquo; options saw that they were less likely to have descriptions relating to enjoyment, vice, decadence, texture and taste. They were more likely to be described in terms evoking simplicity, thinness, or deprivation.</p>
<p>In one study where these healthy options were described with words evoking enjoyment and indulgent, consumption of them increased 29% and were likely to lead to lower snacking afterwards. Adding the words &ldquo;fuller for longer&rdquo; to a yoghurt pot increased people&rsquo;s satiety for 3 hours.</p>
<p>Low socioeconomic status is a risk factor for obesity. There are many potential explanations. One study showed that when people are primed to feel poorer and less secure they tend to choose sweeter snacks and have bigger portion sizes, corresponding to observable changes in the body and brain. People&rsquo;s feelings of social and financial insecurity induced a sense of deprivation which influenced their hormonal response. For people living with this sense of vulnerability long-term, it&rsquo;s possible that this response could increase your likelihood of obesity even if your food choices were healthy.</p>
<h2 id="the-belief-that-healthy-foods-are-unsatisfying-isnt-universal">The belief that healthy foods are unsatisfying isn&rsquo;t universal.</h2>
<p>That belief is strongly held in the US and to a lesser extent the UK and Australia - but the opposite view is more common in France. It&rsquo;s been shown that labelling a food as healthy in France doesn&rsquo;t reduce the satisfaction and pleasure as much as elsewhere.</p>
<p>French people also have fewer negative sentiments associated with treats. When asked to describe which word is more associated with ice-cream, more US people pick &ldquo;fattening&rdquo; whereas French people more commonly pick &ldquo;delicious&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This attitude seems to affect their eating choice and body responses. French people tend to choose smaller servings and spend more time eating them.</p>
<p>The average BMI in France (25.3) is lower than other countries like Germany (26.3), Australia (27.2), the UK (27.3) and especially the US (28.8).</p>
<p>The typical French diet contains higher proportion of saturated fat from butter, cheese, eggs and cream than the UK/US equivalent, yet French people are less likely to suffer from coronary heart disease. There are many possible reasons but expectation could be one. People who believe that they are more at risk of a heart attack are 4x as likely to suffer from heart disease even controlling for other factors.</p>
<h2 id="eating-is-not-a-simple-chemical-process">Eating is not a simple chemical process.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;exactly the same item can be nourishing and satiating, or unfulfilling and nutritionally empty – in large part because of our memories of what we have eaten, our impressions of what it contains and the meanings that we ascribe to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="some-ways-to-apply-these-findings">Some ways to apply these findings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the liquid calories in sweetened drinks.
<ul>
<li>The satiety of most drinks is low</li>
<li>If you must drink juices and smoothies, make them yourself so you are more aware of the food that went into them - research suggests doing this may increase your satiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maximise the pleasure in the food you eat.  Flavour and texture are important during weight loss as the resulting sense of indulgence increases satiety and hormonal response to food. The lack of later snacking due to greater satiety will outweigh the small number of extra calories this my require.
<ul>
<li>Spicy foods or intensely umami ingredients are good options.</li>
<li>Avoid food that gives a sense of deprivation.</li>
<li>Thoroughly enjoy any treats - feeling guilt won&rsquo;t help.  One study showed that dieters who associated treats such as cake with guilt gained weight vs those who associated them with celebration progressed towards their goals.</li>
<li>Do not label foods as sinful, toxic etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualise and anticipate what you&rsquo;re going to eat in advance.
<ul>
<li>Participants who were asked to imagine the taste, smell and texture of sweet treats first opted to have a smaller slice of cake when one was offered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid distractions when eating.</li>
<li>Eat slowly, savoring each mouthful. The greater sensory experience of eating will trigger a stronger hormonal reaction to the food.</li>
<li>Remember what you have eaten.
<ul>
<li>If you feel tempted to snack then first recall what it was like to eat your last meal. Your brain may update its predictions of energy balance, making you feel less hungry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/liz-truss-prime-minister-speech-b2160019.html">victory speech</a> felt decidely unconciliatory to anyone who isn&rsquo;t an ardent Ayn Rand capitalism fan.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s known that performing acts of kindness makes both the receiver and the giver happier. But <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001271">new research</a> shows that givers systematically underestimate the increase in positivity that the receivers actually feel after experiencing the kindness.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re ever in doubt about whether someone would actually appreciate you doing something nice for them, do it anyway - it&rsquo;ll probably make more of a difference than you expect.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/03/learning-how-to.html">Learning how to drink scotch in Edinburgh</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Had a great time visiting the <a href="https://www.scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk/">Scotch Whisky Experience</a> in Edinburgh. Thinking we were going for some kind of formal lesson in the art of scotch tasting, we were somewhat taken back by part one involving getting into a little cart which took us around an fairly trippy exhibition where a ghost explains all sorts of things about the production of scotch.</p>
<p>Later on we entered the <a href="https://www.scotchwhiskyexperience.co.uk/about/the-collection/">Diageo Claive Vidiz collection</a>, which apparently includes a total of 3,384 bottles of whiskey,  for some actual tasting.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/8fdadd3594.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="" />
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to try a bit from all 3000+ bottles unfortunately. Some are pretty rare. The one in the middle below with the colourful artwork on the label apparently sells for around £80,000, if I remember correctly.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/0ad315f391.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<p>Although I guess that&rsquo;s a bargain compared to a bottle that <a href="https://www.maxim.com/food-drink/most-expensive-whiskey-at-auction-2018-5/">sold for £1.1 million</a> in auction a few years ago I guess. I suppose billionaires needed something to do with their money before NFTs were a thing.</p>
<p>The oldest ones in the collection were these two, from the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/812705663f.jpg" width="400" alt="" />
<p>Whilst it looks like someone&rsquo;s drunk a fair bit of especially the right hand one, apparently that&rsquo;s not the case - these are technically unopened bottles. What&rsquo;s missing there is the &lsquo;<a href="https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/angels-share/">angel&rsquo;s share</a>&rsquo;, an ongoing amount of whiskey that evaporates into the atmosphere over time if not perfectly sealed.</p>
<p>I decided I&rsquo;m a big fan of whiskies from the Islay region.</p>

			 <p>For the past 3 months, Germany has been trialling a scheme where for €9 a month people can travel on any regional trains, subways, trams and buses nationwide. Compared to the UK cost of public transport that&rsquo;s basically free!</p>
<p>It sounds like <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2022/08/lessons-germany-experiment-near-free-rail-travel-9-euro-ticket">it wasn&rsquo;t the best planned scheme</a>, so there&rsquo;s a lot any future such schemes should consider to improve implementation.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a winner. More of this please!</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the last train ticket I bought here in the UK, which was booked weeks in advance and required me to take specific trains, cost around £100 for a single return trip.</p>

			 <p>Whilst on vacation in Calabria, we didn&rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to take a trip to the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzo,_Calabria">Pizzo</a>. It&rsquo;s a lovely seaside town, with a 15th century castle overlooking the ocean.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/bb5f6c8e7e.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>A ghostly looking wire sculpture also sits there, permanently enjoying the view.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/050135b065.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<img src="uploads/2022/92e4ae3178.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Slightly away from the rolling waves, the old town seems to be almost the stereotype of European cafe culture, replete with narrow streets and a town square.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/6eb9f084c3.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<img src="uploads/2022/3069491ad9.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>But what most sets Pizzo apart from other delightful towns, and probably the reason it particularly attracts us tourists, is its famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartufo">Tartufo de Pizzo</a>. Described in <a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tartufo-di-pizzo-calabria-ice-cream">various places</a>, including by our tour guide, as &ldquo;the greatest ice cream in the world&rdquo; it is pretty special, and the town has upwards of 20 <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gelateria">gelaterias</a> serving it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a ball of icecream, traditionally chocolate and hazelnut, although there were plenty of other variations on hand, dusted in chocolate powder. This surrounds a delicious melted chocolate centre. Each creator apparently has their own special and top secret recipe for how to make that delectable middle, and they&rsquo;re made in a way that&rsquo;s quite impossible to reproduce the splendour of in for instance a mass supermarket bought product.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/ceb201939f.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<p>The origin story is that a famous ice-cream seller - I&rsquo;ve seen different names given to him in different places so will treat him as anonymous here - needed to make a bunch of desserts for an important event full of VIPs. But, oh no, he ran out of moulds to shape them. Desperate not to let them down he just used his hands to create a rough sphere of ice-cream around some melted chocolate, and dusted them in sugar and chocolate. And thus the phenomena was born.</p>

			 <p>Another place we visited whilst in Calabria was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropea">Tropea</a>. Legendarily founded by Hercules, it&rsquo;s a seaside location which has previously won a &ldquo;most beautiful village in Italy&rdquo; <a href="https://www.calabriatheotheritaly.com/tropea-calabria-italy/">award</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of quaint narrow streets, with many shops selling either fashion items or the famed local <a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tropea-onions-red-queen-calabria">red Tropea onion</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/a5ccca5013.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<p>We picked up a jar of &ldquo;onion marmalade&rdquo; which was far nicer than it sounds. The area is also famed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Nduja">&lsquo;nduja</a> spicy salami.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cathedral that&rsquo;s been there since the 12th century.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/140c98ac0c.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s dedicated to the Madonna of Romania, who supposedly protects the town. Presumably as evidence for that claim, there are a couple of World War II bombs that hit the town but for some reason never exploded displayed right inside the cathedral.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/2dc7ed815e.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<p>Another point of interest is the 4th century <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-maria-dellisola-monastery">Sanctuary of Santa Maria dell’Isola Benedictine monastery</a>. It&rsquo;s been hit by earthquakes a couple of times since then so has had some rather more modern rebuilds, but nonetheless remains extremely picturesque.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/583d597ea9.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>The town is right on the seaside as the above picture suggests. Once again, the sea in this region had some truly incredible colours.</p>

Rather, the area around it seems to be most famous for growing &ldquo;<a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tropea-onions-red-queen-calabria">Rosse di Tropea</a>&rdquo; - the red onions of Tropea.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/sweet-red-onion-tropea">Italy Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The onion’s extraordinary sweetness, its delicate scent, its lightness and enjoyable taste, which derive from the morphological peculiarities of the soil and microclimate where it is grown, make it a much sought after ingredient by gourmets and chefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not wrong! They are surprisingly delicious, just eaten raw. Not something I&rsquo;d usually expect of an onion. Recommended.</p>
<p>In Britain we&rsquo;d need to import the finished onion though. Apparently just growing some locally from seed won&rsquo;t do the job at all; it&rsquo;s all about the conditions of the local land.</p>
<p>But, whilst there were many nearby stalls selling the onion, the most obvious plant life at the place we stopped was what looked to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia">prickly pear cactuses</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/c2f8b137a8.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think to sample the fruit, although it sounds like they&rsquo;re perfectly palatable <a href="https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=2157">if you&rsquo;re careful about removing all the spines</a>.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For our first travels abroad since the start of the Covid pandemic, we recently decided to go holiday in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria">Calabria</a>, a southern region of Italy.</p>
<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=8.953857421875002%2C34.93097858831627%2C23.455810546875004%2C42.512601715736686&layer=mapnik&marker=38.82259097617713%2C16.204833984375" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe><br/><small><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=38.823&mlon=16.205#map=7/38.823/16.205">View Larger Map</a></small>
<p>We stayed at the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g669647-d15565271-Reviews-TUI_MAGIC_LIFE_Calabria-Pizzo_Province_of_Vibo_Valentia_Calabria.html">TUI Magic Life Calabria</a>&rdquo; hotel, which did indeed seem fairly magical!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the scene as one walks towards the lodges we stayed in:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/32c8f5b7fb.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Although rather more of our time was spent by the pool.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/ca153c2c53.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>&hellip;at least in between the <a href="https://www.thelocal.it/20220810/italy-issues-storm-alert-for-central-and-southern-regions-as-heatwave-breaks/">severe storms</a>, which had quite incredible amounts of thunder and lightning. But fortunately they mostly tended to happen at night so didn&rsquo;t impact the fun and games too much (with the possible exception of <a href="https://watchers.news/2022/08/13/violent-storm-hits-stromboli-covering-streets-and-homes-in-tons-of-mud/">a mudslide in Stromboli</a> meaning a trip we&rsquo;d planned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli">the volcano</a> got cancelled).</p>
<p>It was just a 15 minute walk to the beach, which with a mountainous backdrop was a real delight.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/86294c8854.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>One could even rent a bed down there, if a standard sunlounger seemed too much like hard work.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/089b5134c1.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Wandering to the beach takes one through a nice shady forest area.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/440834d38a.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<p>With no shortage of places to comfortably lie down and take in the woody vibes.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/0fc6b6e5b4.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>There was no shortage of entertainment on offer, more than a lazy vacationer like me could ever get to.</p>
<p>The forest concealed an archery range I took a couple of sessions on.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/77ea116c4f.jpg" width="600" height="885" alt="" />
<p>As well as managing to get thoroughly beaten at giant chess.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/a33a82c699.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>I never made it to the tennis lessons, and of course deliberately avoided any activity labelled &ldquo;expert&rdquo; or &ldquo;high intensity&rdquo;. I did just about manage the gym there a couple of times, which is a world record.</p>
<p>On the more spectatory front, there was frequent live music offerings in the little town square type setup they had.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/93d14a0b2b.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>One night a week was &ldquo;Italian night&rdquo; where some supposedly more traditional entertainment was at hand.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/e5e00c9b78.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="" />
<p>Alongside some larger scale antics in a stadium setup. This included a re-enactment of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA">Thriller video</a>:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/214c2a7f94.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Some death-defying acrobatics:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/ebd8c27033.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>And many more varieties of singing and dancing, top of the costuming list perhaps being these folk:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/13f4679188.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Once a week there was a beach party.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/643d734a0c.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Even the food was usually pretty great (and unlimited enough to register a decent increase on the scales the week I got back 😂).</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/2363df467a.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p>Truly a wonderful experience, recommended to all. I&rsquo;d kind of forgotten how good vacations actually were, what with the pandemic and all.</p>

			 <p>I recently learned of the existence of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone">Cain&rsquo;s Jawbone</a> book 📚. It&rsquo;s a murder mystery novel written in 1934.</p>
<p>However, the 100 pages of the book come to you arranged in the wrong order. To solve it you have to figure out the order they should be in. The number of possible combinations is a number with 158 digits.</p>

<p>Originally one could win a prize for doing so - £15 in 1934, and £1000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/10/literary-puzzle-solved-for-just-third-time-in-almost-100-years-cains-jawbone">more recently</a> after it was <a href="https://unbound.com/books/cains-jawbone-paperback/">re-released</a>.</p>

			 <p>Needed to remind myself today that <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/96/">there is no neat practical interpretation</a> of the Pearson&rsquo;s coefficient of correlation &ldquo;r&rdquo; after seeing a report that suggested otherwise.  It&rsquo;s true - it is useful for comparing how strong and in which direction correlations are between two variables. But that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The correlation coefficient is sometimes criticized as having no obvious intrinsic interpretation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as <a href="https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/fulltext/2018/05000/correlation_coefficients__appropriate_use_and.50.aspx">Schober et al</a> put it a little more formally.</p>
<p>You can square it to produce an R<sup>2</sup> if you like to produce a &ldquo;coefficient of determination&rdquo;, which does have an IRL meaning. R<sup>2</sup> expresses the percent of variation in one variable that&rsquo;s explained by the variation in the other one.</p>
<p>Just the same as R<sup>2</sup> in a linear regression model. In fact a simple linear regression like &ldquo;y given x&rdquo; will have an R<sup>2</sup> that is the square of the correlation coefficient between x and y.</p>

			 <p>Recorded crime in the UK has reached a 20 year high in the first quarter of 2022, with 6.3 million crimes recorded.</p>
<p>Now this may well relate to changes in policy or willingness to report rather than a general increase in crime. Especially as the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2022">ONS crime survey</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t require the crime to have been reported to the police, doesn&rsquo;t appear to show an increase in overall crime, at least at first glance.</p>
<p>But something that definitely appears to be the case is that only a tiny proportion of recorded crime results in someone being charged.</p>
<p>Now I usually find myself on the side of wanting to reduce the number of situations police get involved in. Criminalising someone should be a last resort. Police officers seem to be regularly sent in to handle situations that other people would likely be better trained for, including being asked to deal with an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/18/police-999-callouts-to-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-soars"> increasing number of situations</a> where someone is suffering from a mental health crisis. This is not a good situation for either party concerned.</p>
<p>But where a crime has been committed then that is the domain of the police. Despite not having a particularly optimistic view of the situation, even I was a little shocked to read that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/recorded-in-england-and-wales-at-20-year-high-as-charge-rate-hits-new-low">only 5.6% of offences</a> reported in 2021-2022 led to a suspect being charged or summonsed.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, rape remains one of the rarest crimes to end up with a suspect being charged, with only 1.3% of reported crimes resulting in one.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/07/police-fail-solve-single-theft-eight-10-neighbourhoods">Telegraph investigation</a> showed that in 84% of nearly 21,000 neighbourhoods that had reported at least one theft in the last three years, no suspects were ever identified fpr any of them. In 20 neighbourhoods over 100 thefts had been reported, with zero being solved.</p>
<p>No doubt part of this is explainable by the decline of the capabilities of many public services, at least partly thanks to Conservative&rsquo;s lack of investment or care.</p>
<p>The number of police officers in England and Wales<a href="https://fullfact.org/crime/police-numbers/"> fell by over 20,000</a> between 2010 and 2019, although <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955182/police-workforce-mar20-hosb2020.pdf">this looks</a> as though they increased to narrow the gap a little in 2020. I don&rsquo;t know the research on to what extent raw police numbers relate to the rate of solving crime, but intuitively presumably there&rsquo;s a floor at which there&rsquo;s simply no resources left to carry out thorough investigations. Even holding the numbers steady wouldn&rsquo;t make sense if there&rsquo;s an increase in the number of crimes being reported.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably also indirect effects based on cuts to other services.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nhs-crisis-armed-police-heart-attacks-b2138086.html">the Independent reported</a>  that due to a lack of NHS resources the police have now become a surrogate ambulance service in some places. Police personnel and vehicles are being sent to assist, transport and wait with patients who are suffering emergency medical conditions such as heart attacks. More sitting in hospitals waiting for a spare NHS bed for the unlucky patient they&rsquo;re with presumably entails less time to solve crimes.</p>

Lots to think about here about the nightmarish oft-unspoken issues we have dealing with death, whether our own or others. Very recommended, if you&rsquo;re ready to stare into the uncomfortable void.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/28/tolstoy-death-ivan-ilyich-devil-review">Guardian review</a> sums it up nicely as:</p>

<li>There are just way more people that are vaccinated than unvaccinated in the UK. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations">Over 93%</a> of the English eligible population have had at least 1 dose.</li>
<li>Those who are vaccinated tend to be older (and possibly have other high-risk conditions), making them much more vulnerable to dying from Covid if there is a brekathrough infection, which inevitably at times there is.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as you control for just the difference in number of and age of people it becomes apparent that the vaccines still seem very effective at saving lives.</p>

			 <p>Liz Truss, the odds-on favourite to be the British Prime Minister in a few weeks time, appears to be proposing to solve the cost of living crisis - i.e. people not having enough money to live a decent life - by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous">reducing the amount of money a bunch of people have</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently &ldquo;tailoring&rdquo; pay for civil servants is going to save up to £8.8 billion. Given the total civil service pay bill is apparently around £9 billion per year, that seems - even in its own terms - <em>ambitious</em>.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780316010764">Oblivion: Stories</a> by David Foster Wallace 📚.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/the-lost-years-and-last-days-of-david-foster-wallace-883224/">Rolling Stone</a> quotes him as wanting to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;stuff about what it feels like to live. Instead of being a relief from what it feels like to live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I think he certainly achieved that goal in this book. I found this an incredible collection of short stories that range from the absurd through to those that have an upsettingly familiar verbalisation of the unspoken pain of everyday existence.</p>
<p>Pretty much every story felt enriching and deep, with a weirdly enticing property of &ldquo;are there more layers I&rsquo;m not even beginning to understand?&rdquo; upon completion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incarnations of Burned Children&rdquo; is both one of the shortest and one of the most intense and horrific stories I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>

			 <p>As a reminder of the increasing salience of climate change, it was interesting to read about the cohort of Americans who are <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/04/climateproof-duluth-why-the-city-is-attracting-climate-migrants">already making the decision on where to live</a> within their country based on perceived resilience to the effects of climate change. They&rsquo;re essentially internal climate migrants.</p>
<p>This sometimes involves moving from the &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; popular cities, such as San Francisco with its proximity to regular wildfires, to lesser known places. It seems like the town of Duluth is <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-pioneers-flee-fire-heat-for-famously-frigid-duluth/">one semi popular option</a>. Although naturally that led to housing prices increasing rapidly. So, whilst one needed a certain amount of privilege to be in a position to relocate in the first place, it&rsquo;s increasingly going to be an opportunity only available to the wealthier; a continuation of the housing market&rsquo;s seemingly insatiable ability to divide the world into the haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>From the article, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that we know how many relocation decisions are <em>primarily</em> driven by climate concerns, but a <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/climate-change-migration-survey/">survey it links to</a> (I haven&rsquo;t checked validity of it!)  suggests it is something that many people at least consider as a factor, especially those under 45 years old.</p>
<p>For those people who do want to think about this, CNN used some analysis from a firm called FourTwentySeven that analyses climate risk data <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/opinions/climate-migration-in-america-california-duluth-sutter/index.html">to produce maps</a>  that show various measures of climate-related risk factors projected forward a decade or two.</p>

			 <p>As highlighted by <a href="https://twitter.com/thhamilton/status/1548782822953222145">Tom Hamilton&rsquo;s juxtaposition</a> of a couple of recent newspaper front pages, it&rsquo;s wildly exciting to see that the UK is likely to have a socialist government soon! 😍</p>
<p>Rees-Mogg tells Sunak his tax increases are socialist.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/d6b9db140e.jpg" width="450" height="592" alt="" />
<p>Whereas Sunak tells Truss and Mordaunt that their tax <em>decreases</em> are&hellip;um&hellip;socialist.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/b35baa8803.jpg" width="450" height="592" alt="" />
<p>Just like various other culture war topics, using &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;evil&rdquo; seems to be another of those unfortunate phenomena that UK Conservatives seem desperate to import from the US. Despite the fact that at present I don&rsquo;t <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s as effective in terms as inspiring hatred and conflict over here as it is there (?), thankfully.</p>

			 <p>In an unexpected twist, the latest front in the mostly-meh-version of the culture war that UK Conservatives seem desperate to provoke appears to be…the weather.</p>
<p>Sir John Hayes, a Conservative MP who  chairs the presumably sarcastically named  named ‘<a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956845/what-is-the-conservatives-common-sense-group">Common Sense Group</a>’ and by amazing coincidence also happens to <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/220711/hayes_john.htm">receive £50,000 a year</a> from an oil company, had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/17/tory-mp-calls-people-sheltering-from-extreme-heat-cowards-and-snowflakes-17013249/">the following</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a brave new world but a cowardly new world where we live in a country where we are frightened of the heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not surprising that in snowflake Britain, the snowflakes are melting.Thankfully, most of us are not snowflakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that we clamour for hot weather for most of the year and then shut down when it does heat up is indicative of the state in which we now live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone was curious about actual facts, the chance of the next few days featuring the hottest ever temperatures seen in the UK has risen to 80%, which is likely to <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/matt-frei/excess-deaths-heatwave-uk-weather-national-emergency-temperatures-40c/">cause thousands of deaths</a> even if people do ‘cowardly’ take precautions.</p>
<p>There’s a type of modern conservative - thankfully seen more overseas as far as I can tell - that really just seems to <em>love</em> owning libs by recommending that their own followers do things that are likely to cause harm to themselves.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday a friend sent me this absolute horror show of a temperature forecast map for the UK.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/78290fb40c.jpg" width="600" height="730" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s already been hot a while, but seemingly next Monday and Tuesday are going to feel <em>extra</em> unlivable for us in the UK, where it&rsquo;s not very common for people to have air con or many other anti-being-too-hot facilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/12/uk-weather-amber-warning-for-extreme-heat-extended-into-next-week">MET has issued</a> an extreme heat warning. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/14/uk-heatwave-nhs-braced-as-minister-says-temperatures-could-hit-40c">NHS is trying to brace itself</a> for yet more health emergencies in amongst all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/10/theres-a-feeling-of-powerlessness-uk-healthcare-workers-on-rising-covid-numbers">ongoing Covid</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of heat can in particular be dangerous to older people with certain medical conditions, so there&rsquo;s lots of good advice out there about checking on your potentially vulnerable neighbours. But if it gets hot enough that a <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-07-12/what-is-a-level-4-heat-health-warning-and-could-there-be-a-national-emergency">level 4 heatwave alert</a> is issued for the first time ever, then then even the risk-factor-free population may suffer harm if precautions are not taken.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/a4992b8b2d.png" width="600" height="404" alt="" />
<p>Some of the potential side-effects of this type of excessive heat can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road surfaces and pavements melting, as <a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/roads-melt-and-rail-tracks-buckle-as-uk-heatwave-strikes-27-06-2018/">happened in previous heatwaves</a>.</li>
<li>Railway lines buckling. Railway lines can get to be <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/buckled-rail-and-summer-heat/">20 degrees hotter</a> than the air temperature. At a certain temperature, <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/speed-restrictions/">restrictions</a> are placed on the speed of trains.</li>
<li>Electricity supply problems - both because there&rsquo;s an increase in demand for energy, and the heat reduces how much power the system can carry. Plus power stations get less efficient. It&rsquo;s possible that certain designs of nuclear power reactors <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/articles/nuclear-power-feeling-the-heat/">have to shut down</a> because the water used to cool them gets too warm, although so far that&rsquo;s never happened in the UK.</li>
<li>Water shortages, due to excessive demand.</li>
<li>Wildfires starting.</li>
<li>Smell, dust, infestations.</li>
<li>Reduced crop harvests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically a lot of stuff that in extremis sounds a little dystopian. But it is 2022, so I wouldn&rsquo;t rule any of it out.</p>
<p>There’s an estimated 30% chance that next week will in fact beat the current UK highest ever temperature on record, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c">38.7 degrees Celsius</a> in July 2019.</p>
<p>New temperature records - and the associated death and destruction - might not be rare in the future though if we don&rsquo;t finally find a way to reduce humanity&rsquo;s damage to the environment. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16834-0#Sec10">study from a couple of years back</a> estimated that temperatures about 40 degrees would be seen every 3-4 years in the UK by the end of the century if we don&rsquo;t do something to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

			 <p>The Conservative leadership contest is progressing with all the charm and grace you would imagine. Intra-party leaks and briefings about rival candidates, lots of truly ludicrous tax cut promises and a bit of culture war here and there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many of them - eleven candidates at one point before Chishti, Javid and Shapps withdrew. And despite the fact that everyone has an opinion, it&rsquo;s not clear that we actually know who they even are.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547234440497209344">A poll</a> from <a href="https://comresglobal.com/">Savanta ComRes</a>  asked people to name the candidates based on their official photo.</p>
<p>Looking at the more realistic-to-have-a-chance few, about two-thirds of people could identify Rishi Sunak, a third could identify Liz Truss and just 11% managed Penny Mordaunt.</p>
<p>If you look only at Conservative voters, the numbers don&rsquo;t exactly sky-rocket - 77%, 45% and 16% respectively.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547240171216769025">Two people</a> thought Mordaunt was the global soul-pop sensation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele">Adele</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/5a9ce4595c.png" width="600" height="326" alt="" />
<p>In a way this doesn&rsquo;t yet matter. The British public has no direct way to select the next Prime Minister. The way the system works it&rsquo;s only the <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/parties/Commons">358 Conservative MPs</a> that get a say in which candidate progresses at this stage. When it&rsquo;s down to the final two then a tiny subsection of the British public - the <a href="https://qz.com/1644202/who-are-the-160000-conservatives-picking-the-next-uk-prime-minister/">0.35% of the electorate</a> that are members of the Conservative party - get to cast their votes, assuming neither of the candidates stands down. So actually there&rsquo;s a way in which if 99% of Britons have no knowledge whatsoever of who any of the candidates are it might not change too much in terms of the short term outcome.</p>
<p>Of course the 0.35% who do get a vote are not a random selection of the population - they skew:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older: 40% are over 66 years old according to the <a href="https://esrcpartymembersproject.org/">Party Member&rsquo;s Project</a>, quoted by <a href="https://qz.com/1644202/who-are-the-160000-conservatives-picking-the-next-uk-prime-minister/">Quartz</a></li>
<li>Whiter: 97%  white vs 86% of the population</li>
<li>More &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; 86% from the top social classes &ldquo;ABC1&rdquo;, vs 55% of the population (at least the latter was the figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRS_social_grade">in 2016</a>)</li>
<li>Richer: 1 in 20 of them making more than £100k a year</li>
<li>Male: 70% male, vs an unsurprisingly near 50:50 split in the population</li>
</ul>
<p>Better yet, Ipsos Mori conducted <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/almost-4-10-think-rishi-sunak-would-do-good-job-pm-he-also-most-well-known-candidates">a survey</a> designed to be representative of adults aged 18-75 in Great Britain. One of the questions, appearing on slide 3 of <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-07/Ipsos_Conservative_Leadership_poll_130722_PUBLIC%20%28002%29.pdf">the output</a>, asked about &ldquo;familiarity with politicians&rdquo;, with most of the questions being about the Conservative leadership candidates.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/df32aadff1.png" width="600" height="340" alt="" />
<p>Sunak outpaces the others by quite a lot in terms of recognition. The politician least familiar to the British public in that survey was Stewart Lewis. A full 65% of people said they hadn&rsquo;t ever heard of him, and only 12% claimed to know at least a fair amount about him.</p>
<p>The inevitable twist is that there is no British politician called Stewart Lewis, despite the fact that over a third of people made out that they&rsquo;d heard of him - substantially higher than the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman constant</a> of 4%.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/07/04/royal-mail-are.html">Barcoding the Queen&#39;s head - the new(ish) British stamp</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/07/04/royal-mail-are.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-07-04 16:10:12 &#43;0000">Jul 4, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/">Royal Mail</a> released a bunch of <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcoded-stamps">stamps</a>, wherein the queen&rsquo;s face is accompanied by a weird looking barcode. When you scan the barcode in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-mail/id1435168829/">their app</a> you, somewhat inexplicably, get shown <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcode-stamps/videos">a video of Shaun the Sheep</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/c0d7c53f23.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="" />
<p>(For reference, the perforation between the Queen&rsquo;s head and the barcode is fake, so you can&rsquo;t easily tear them off.)</p>
<p>This will invalidate the majority of stamps you might already own - the standard stamps that are just the Queen&rsquo;s head won&rsquo;t be valid after January 2023, although you can apply to swap the current ones for new ones if you like. But the special edition stamps with nice pictures on will still be OK to use.</p>
<p>Whilst badgering you to download an app to repeatedly watch a short novelty video is clearly massive added value worthy of this radical change alone, apparently that&rsquo;s not the entire goal behind this change. Rather <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset">Royal Mail claims</a> that the ability to track letters with barcodes will let it monitor and respond to changes in demand. It&rsquo;ll also apparently prevent people washing off the postmark ink from stamps and re-selling them for a second use on the black market. I guess that means that barcodes will be tracked and the stamps rejected if used more than once.</p>
<p>I had no idea that re-using stamps was an avenue of fraudulence so prevalent that it costs Royal Mail tens of millions of pounds a year, but apparently so. Re-using stamps <a href="https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14308/~/what-is-stamp-fraud">is already a crime</a>, for which you can be criminally prosecuted. On the receiver&rsquo;s end, they don&rsquo;t get the letter delivered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/royal-mail-crackdown-crooks-cash-12246684">unless they&rsquo;re willing to pay £1.50 and collect it</a>. Of course that&rsquo;s only if the crime is detected, but even pre-barcode Royal Mail made efforts in that direction, including apparently <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html">checking whether the stamp has lost its phosphor</a>.</p>
<p>There are seemingly some big operations out there. In 2019 Paul and Samantha Harrison <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html">were convicted of fraud</a> for having washed the postmark ink off 700,000 used stamps and selling the resulting &ldquo;usable&rdquo; stamps online, meaning Royal Mail lost out on a potential £421,000 of revenue.</p>
<p>All that aside, stamp traditionalists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset">not pleased</a> with the new design. I must admit feeling some aesthetic sympathy for their point of view.  And also some solidarity with the <a href="https://thehandwrittenletterappreciationsociety.org/">Handwritten Letter Appreciation Society</a>, which has below zero interest in digitally engaging with Shaun the Sheep when corresponding with fellow humans. Their founder, Dinah Johnson, worries that it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end for stamps in general, fearing that in future we&rsquo;ll just be sticking the boring barcode bit of the setup on envelopes.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/07/03/the-uks-carbon.html">The UK&#39;s carbon emissions trading scheme actually paid polluters last year</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The UK has an carbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Emissions_Trading_Scheme">emissions trading scheme</a> (ETS) such that, within certain industries, companies that create <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-costs/environmental/">environmentally damaging</a> carbon dioxide when doing whatever it is that they do have to own a permit for per ton of carbon dioxide that they emit. It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading">cap and trade</a> type scheme, designed to limit CO2 emissions to a known maximum, and ensure emission allowances end up in the hands of those who most value them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of permits available, which can be traded on a free market. If you want to increase the amount of CO2 you want to emit, then you have to find someone willing to sell you their permit and pay whatever price they want for it. Thus, the polluter pays.</p>
<p>If, due to the laws of supply and demand, it starts to cost too much to buy such a permit on the market then you&rsquo;ll just have to figure out a way to not generate so much CO2 in the course of your business. Or pay a hefty fine if you do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion to be had about this type of policy from many viewpoints. But there&rsquo;s an obvious way to entirely invalidate any good effect it has, which would be to ensure that all companies have more than enough permits to do exactly what they want at no cost at all. So, naturally, that&rsquo;s exactly what the government seems to have done in recent times, at least for the UK aviation industry.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/secret-subsidies-how-the-gov-is-gifting-free-money-to-airlines/">Transport &amp; Environment analysis</a>, airlines were given free allowances worth £242 million last year, which corresponds to 4.4 million permits.</p>
<p>However only 3.4 million permits were actually used, meaning that not only did these companies not actually have to pay for their pollution, but in fact they could actually sell the excess 0.9 million permits on the market and make free money, if they could find a buyer. Had these been sold then that&rsquo;s apparently a potential of up to £72 million profit they&rsquo;d get for nothing.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/f50882af66.png" width="600" height="318" alt="" />
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/24/uk-gave-airlines-44m-free-pollution-permits-in-2021-study-finds?CMP=share_btn_tw">Easyjet say they did not sell their excess</a>; others unknown.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re talking here about the government giving out these free allowances, of course this is all forgone public money (or &ldquo;taxpayer&rsquo;s money&rdquo;, if you believe in that concept).</p>
<p>One arguably &ldquo;mitigating&rdquo; reason this arose was because there were many fewer flights taken in 2021 than in previous years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It seems like airlines' <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-ets-apply-for-free-allocation">free allowances are based on data from 2010</a>. But a cap and trade scheme wherein each year the controlling body blindly adds more and more free permits to the market, even to the point that there&rsquo;s too many to even use, doesn&rsquo;t feel like a particularly efffective cap.</p>
<p>These permits are in any case <a href="https://www.fccaviation.com/regulation/united-kingdom/uk-emissions-trading-system">only required for UK flights departing to other UK destinations, the European Economic Area or Gibraltar</a>. So no permits are required for long haul flights, which are those that actually cause the most pollution from many airlines that operate in the UK. In 2019, only 14% of the CO2 emissions from British Airways required these permits.</p>

			 <p>Finally got around to trying out <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/">Fall Guys</a> 🎮. It&rsquo;s a multiplayer battle royale type game where, as a contestant on a supposed TV show you&rsquo;ve got to get through various mini-games - mainly winning races and not falling into slime - until there&rsquo;s only 1 player left standing.</p>
<p>The premise, and something about the screen you get when each game concludes, gives me strong vibes of one of the TV shows that most stuck in my brain in the recent past, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game">Squid Game</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/57f7c91eef.png" width="450" height="270" alt="" />
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing dark about Fall Guys, it&rsquo;s all family-friendly fun. It&rsquo;s only Squid Game if everyone involved was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blobby">Mr Blobby</a>, you lived in a cartoon world, and when you lost you got fewer &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; than you otherwise would have, rather than being shot.</p>
<p>A better comparison might be the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi's_Castle">Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle</a>. In fact, one of the minigames is exactly the same as the second entry in this random collection of &ldquo;best bits&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mindless fun that I doubt isn&rsquo;t going to keep my attention in solitary form, but perhaps a good party game. It does feel a little microtransactiony-tacky, but they seem pretty cosmetic, and at least it means that the game is free to play.</p>

<p>Each year since 2014, there&rsquo;s been a <a href="https://www.futurelibrary.no/">Future Library</a> ceremony in a young Norwegian forest, wherein people witness an author handing over an unpublished manuscript.</p>
<p>That manuscript is locked away in a special &ldquo;Silent Room&rdquo; within Oslo library. All we know about it is its author and its title.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all most of us will probably ever know about it. Because it&rsquo;s not until the year 2124 that the manuscripts will be revealed, with the forest being chopped down in order to make the paper for the resulting books to be published on.</p>
<p>Naturally the authors involved, and most of the rest of the world, so far will likely be dead. So you&rsquo;re going to have to go through life just knowing you&rsquo;ll probably never be able to read the full works of Margaret Atwood,  David Mitchell, Sjón,  Elif Shafak, Han Kan, Karl Ove Knausgård,  Ocean Vuong, Tsitsi Dangarembga and whoever gets picked in the years to come. And they&rsquo;ll never know if people thought their work worth the wait or not.</p>

			 <p>Flickers of joy amongst the desolation of 2022 can be felt through a good amount of the UK as the Conservatives were thoroughly beaten in last week&rsquo;s 2 by-elections.</p>
<p>The first was in Tiverton and Honiton, where the Tory incumbent had to quit on the basis of having been caught <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/disgraced-tory-mp-neil-parish-broke-law-by-watching-porn-in-commons">watching porn in the House of Commons</a> . Word on the street was that he was innocently <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/porn-mp-neil-parish-may-have-been-looking-for-a-claas-dominator-tractor-allies-suggest-1605703">searching for a &ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;-branded farm vehicle</a> but got led astray, twice.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/24/lib-dems-win-tiverton-and-honiton-byelection-overturning-huge-tory-majority">Lib Dems made out there</a>, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000 - rumoured to be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/24/tories-lose-byelections-wakefield-tiverton-honiton-labour-lib-dems">biggest majority ever</a> to be overturned in a by-election, with an unprecedented 30 point swing.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/40ca0edffb.png" width="600" height="276" alt="" />
<p>Even their classic post victory stunt was only about 90% cringe this time.</p>
<iframe width="400" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av-embeds/61922694"></iframe>
<p>The second was in Wakefield. The Tory incumbent there had to go, this time on the extremely upsetting basis that he had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/imran-ahmad-khan-sentenced-to-18-months-over-sexual-assault-of-boy-15">sent to jail for sexually assaulting a 15 year old boy</a>.</p>
<p>Here <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-61896693">it was Labour who got the seat</a>, this time with a margin of 4,921 votes, around a 13% swing.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/18f12ae384.png" width="600" height="332" alt="" />
<p>It&rsquo;s not a naturally Conservative seat, the 2019 outcome  having been the first time they held it within nearly 90 years. But still, hopefully a sign that the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wall_(British_politics)">Red Wall</a>&rdquo; is vulnerable. At least if you&rsquo;re a party who just can&rsquo;t get rid of a leader that most of the population think is doing a real bad job at playing Prime Minister according to the <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating">latest YouGov polling</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/b53783d398.png" width="600" height="270" alt="" />
<p>When asked whether he would be resigning given this catastrophic result, Boris Johnson seemed to be continuing the trend of not letting real life get in the way of his hopes and dreams, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-delusional-third-term-27329859">started talking about his third term</a>.</p>
<p>That implies he&rsquo;s confident he&rsquo;ll still be &ldquo;leading&rdquo; our country in the 2030s; a thought described as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/25/boris-johnsons-aspiration-to-serve-for-a-third-term-delusional">completely delusional</a>&rdquo; by one of his previous cabinet ministers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In one of those policies that might almost seem hilarious if it wasn&rsquo;t entirely based on ignorance, prejudice and cruelty, the Saudi Arabia state has apparently <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/19/middleeast/saudi-arabia-rainbow-colored-toys-ban-intl/index.html">sent out officials to confiscate any rainbow-coloured toys and clothing</a> on sale, be they colourful hair clips, hats, pencil cases or anything else bright and shiny.</p>
<p>Presumably because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_flag">Pride flags</a> usually have a rainbow-inspired  design, their rationale is that rainbow coloured products contradict &ldquo;normal common sense&rdquo;, send a &ldquo;poisoned message&rdquo; to children, and &ldquo;promote homosexual colours&rdquo;, whatever that could possibly even mean.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re concerned that if a child sees a rainbow coloured pencil case they will become gay. And that that&rsquo;s somehow a bad thing even if it wasn&rsquo;t pure nonsense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of their state position on what should be done should an <em>actual</em> rainbow appear in the sky.</p>
<p>Just to reinforce the cold hard reality of the situation behind such breathtakingly absurd policies as this, Saudia Arabia is one of ten countries where having gay sex is potentially <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/">punishable by death</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What can one say, even as a citizen of another country, other than to share the anger and sorrow that in the past few days <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">the Supreme Court of the United States</a> looks to have destroyed decades of progress towards a better, more humane, society.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the <a href="https://theconversation.com/3-ways-a-6-3-supreme-court-would-be-different-146558">6:3 conservative</a>, and seemingly very <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/judicial-activism">activist</a>, court started off by ruling that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jun/21/sonia-sotomayor-supreme-court-separation-church-state">a state cannot exclude religious schools from tuition programs</a>. The fact that states must - not can, but <em>must</em> - now subsidise religious organisations is particularly controversial for a country that makes a big deal of the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>Or as Justice Sotomayor <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/separation-of-church-and-state-is-crumbling-before-our-eyes">put it</a> in her dissent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that the Court was leading us to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment… Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then on Thursday, following 2 very high profile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york-joe-biden">mass</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-gun-violence">shootings</a> in the past few weeks (and another 283 mostly less profile such events <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">catalogued</a> so far this year), <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/23/supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-gun-law-along-ideological-lines-00041691">the court ruled</a> that New York&rsquo;s 100+ year old law that you should have a license and a specific reason if you want to carry a gun in a public space is illegitimate. Thus New Yorkers, and potentially in the future residents in another seven states with similar laws, will likely have to go about their business in the knowledge that anyone in their vicinity may have a concealed and loaded gun and, well, that&rsquo;s just how it is.</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/supreme-court-abortion-law-leak-roe-v-wade">the leak</a> became policy. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn?t=1656185382130">Roe vs Wade has been overturned</a>, against <a href="https://www.prri.org/spotlight/overturning-roe-would-fly-in-the-face-of-american-public-opinion/">the wishes of most Americans</a>  - even most religious Americans.</p>
<p>And with that so too the constitutional right for US citizens to have access to abortion. As we knew, nearly a quarter of states had &ldquo;trigger laws&rdquo; already in place with the purpose of banning safe and legal abortion in the case that this decision was made. And at least another quarter are thought likely to ban abortion, such that anyone who may become pregnant in around half of the US states just lost their right to self-determination, potentially their quality of their life, or, in the most awful cases, their life itself.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/cc6d138472.jpg" width="450" height="675" alt="" />
<p>In the past few decades, countries have tended to move towards democracy, equal rights for women, and with that most often increasing access to abortion. The US appears to be moving in the opposite direction, a more authoritarian regime where even the elected president <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/">doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to do much</a> to restrain the impact of the views of five people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">These five, as well as the four others</a> that make up the entirety of the Supreme Court were appointed in a process not designed to be congruent with the will of the American people, which in recent times appears to have been enacted with  no shortage of controversy, even on its own terms.  As an external observer, they appear to me as a unremovable, unaccountable handful of appointees with sometimes life-or-death power over more than 300 million people&rsquo;s lived experiences.</p>
<p>The judges didn&rsquo;t temper the wording since the leaked draft one bit. Justice Thomas' concordance <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3535841-thomas-calls-for-overturning-precedents-on-contraceptives-lgbtq-rights/">explicitly called out</a> by name three cases that he thinks should be reconsidered - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut">Griswold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas">Lawrence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">Obergefell</a>.</p>
<p>These cases correspond to rulings that couples have the right to access contraceptives, that gay sex cannot be outlawed by states and the right to same-sex marriage. Within the US, the very idea that these already-decided issues would be back on any respectable court&rsquo;s agenda in 2022 is surely jarring, shocking, and likely deadly.</p>

			 <p>Herald the entry of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61840077">a new statistical misadventure</a> from our government, never shy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/boris-johnson-again-reprimanded-after-misleading-employment-claim">of</a> <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18490303.stats-watchdog-slams-uk-government-misleading-coronavirus-figures/">fiddling</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41301049">the</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/08/uk-statistics-body-has-serious-concerns-over-dfe-funding-claims">books</a>.</p>
<p>In the context of disparaging the current <a href="https://www.rmt.org.uk/">RMT union&rsquo;s</a> railway workers strike that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/rail-strikes-city-centres-quieter-as-people-heed-advice-to-avoid-travel">taking place at the moment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr Shapps went on to say: &ldquo;The median salary for the rail sector is £44,000, which is significantly above the median salary in the country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We asked the Department for Transport (DfT) how it got to this figure and it initially said it had taken the median figures from the ONS for four categories of workers, added them up and divided by four</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I barely know what to call that calculation. The mean average of medians? It most certainly is not the median.</p>
<p>Out of interest, the 4 categories, in order of actual median salary, were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rail travel assistants</li>
<li>Rail construction and maintenance operatives</li>
<li>Rail transport operatives</li>
<li>Train and tram drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>To work out the median salary earned, you need to line up each individual&rsquo;s salary in a row, low to high, and pick the middle one. Admittedly I haven&rsquo;t looked it up, but I feel it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that there are more lesser-paid rail travel assistants than higher-paid train drivers out there.</p>
<p>To compound the crime against maths, the highest paid category of those four, train drivers, is apparently largely irrelevant to the current RMT strikes - because almost none of them are actually in the RMT union. They tend to be members of <a href="https://aslef.org.uk/">ASLEF</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the RMT union does apparently often include the lower-paid of the listed categories, it also includes staff such as 10,000 cleaners, who are routinely paid a lot less than <em>any</em> of the listed roles.</p>

			 <p>Amazon has apparently created the ability for its voice &ldquo;assistant&rdquo; Alexa <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/amazon-demonstrates-alexa-mimicking-the-voice-of-a-deceased-relative.html">to simulate any human voice</a> after just a minute of listening to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a demonstration video, a child said, “Alexa, can Grandma finish reading me the Wizard of Oz?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the darkest scenario is the exact one they have in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it could ostensibly be used to replicate any voice, Prasad suggested it could be used to help memorialize a deceased family member.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently their SVP has forgotten that this <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-be-right-back-is-a-masterful-exploration-of-fear-love-and-death/">did not work out well</a> for <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror">Black Mirror&rsquo;s</a> Ash and Martha.</p>
<p>Honestly, more than once I&rsquo;ve felt that Big Tech somehow missed the point that that show is more deliberately horrifying and dystopian than a blueprint for things to go ahead and unthinkingly realease onto the world. Unless I&rsquo;m just getting old?</p>

			 <p>Recently I have been playing with the Markup&rsquo;s privacy-checking tool &ldquo;<a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight</a>&rdquo;. You give it the URL of any website you like. It then virtually visits the website and looks at what scripts it is sent by the site, picking out any that fall in the following 7 categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party cookies</li>
<li>Ad trackers</li>
<li>Key logging</li>
<li>Session recording</li>
<li>Canvas fingerprinting</li>
<li>Facebook tracking</li>
<li>Google Analytics “Remarketing Audiences”</li>
</ul>
<p>On the very first site I tried (which was just the last site I&rsquo;d visited so nothing designed to be a special test), it found about 20 ad trackers and 60 third party cookies on its homepage. It also detected a session recorder, which tracks a visitor&rsquo;s mouse movement, clicks, scrolls and so on. It was also logging the text users typed into a webpage even before you pressed submit. It also specifically let both Facebook and Google know that you&rsquo;d visited.</p>
<p>Finally it listed some of the advertising companies that the website had interacted with behind the scenes - in this case a list of about 15 disparate organisations.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve no reason to suspect that the site was aiming to do anything unusually weird or problematic with this data. Perhaps disturbingly, these aren&rsquo;t particularly rare practices. But it is a lot. Far more than I felt I&rsquo;d implicitly or explicitly consented to just by visiting a random company&rsquo;s homepage. And this data is all ending up somewhere out of my control, including ready for use by organisations others than the one that owned the site, for purposes other than giving me the information I was seeking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more about how Blacklight works and further background on T<a href="https://themarkup.org/series/blacklight">he Markup&rsquo;s site</a>, including why <a href="https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2020/10/01/i-scanned-my-favorite-social-media-site-on-blacklight-and-it-came-up-pretty-clean-whats-going-on">it isn&rsquo;t necessarily reassuring</a> that Facebook on the surface comes back pretty spotless, and some <a href="https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2020/09/22/i-scanned-the-websites-i-visit-with-blacklight-and-its-horrifying-now-what">steps you can take</a> if you are not comfortable with the level of surveillance a given site non-consensually forces upon you.</p>

			 <p>I came across an interesting paper &ldquo;<a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/download/volume%201/february_/Time%20as%20a%20Network%20Good.pdf">Time as a Network Good</a>&rdquo; which looks at how  both employed and unemployed people feel about the weekends.</p>
<p>Intuitively we might expect people working the standard Monday-to-Friday routine would enjoy not having to go to work.  But actually both employed <em>and</em> unemployed people apparently report looking forward to, and being happier during, weekends a similar amount.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to go to work&rdquo; that makes weekends fun.</p>
<p>The authors' hypothesis as to the explanation relates to happiness being a product of spending time with other people, and in general more people have time free to do that at weekends . Both employed and unemployed people spend more time socialising at weekends.</p>
<p>I read this also as another nail in the coffin of sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;employed people are right to be jealous of all the time not at work that unemployed people have&rdquo;. Whatever the media or political myths may be, on average, unemployed people <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/does-work-make-you-happy-evidence-from-the-world-happiness-report">are less happy</a> than those in work, at least in societies such as the US and UK today.</p>
<p>(Caveat: so far I only read the abstract.)</p>

			 <p>The EFF&rsquo;s tool &ldquo;<a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">Cover Your Tracks</a>&rdquo; seems a great way to check how well defended your web browser is against the various methods of behind-the-scenes tracking us and our internet behaviour that pervade the web today.</p>
<p>Once you hit the button it simulates tracking via:</p>
<ul>
<li>visible adverts set up to track you.</li>
<li>a non-visible tracking beacon.</li>
<li>interacting with a domain that implements the Do Not Track policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore it measures how susceptible you are to tracking via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">browser fingerprinting</a> - i.e. how unique is the configuration info that your browser makes accessible to sites. The more consistent and unique your browser info is, the easier in theory it is for a company to create a profile about you and track your behaviour even if you block or delete any tracking cookies.</p>
<p>There is a disclaimer that due to ever-evolving technology there may well be other methods of potentially tracking your behaviour that are not covered here, but these appear to be the common ones.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the results I got with the default version of the very popular <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> web browser:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/6f7ed7ccc1.png" width="600" height="205" alt="" />
<p>Adding the <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> extension to Chrome got rid of a lot of trackers:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/ece02a2e7a.png" width="600" height="186" alt="" />
<p>And finally with the default settings of privacy-focussed browser, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>:</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/9fad17be3d.png" width="600" height="192" alt="" />
<p>Once your have run the test yourself, it will also give you a detailed list of all the potential fingerprinting data your browser is offering up.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still struggling to get my mind wrapped around the incredible case of <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/">Blake Lemoine</a>, a Google engineer who has been put on administrative leave, seemingly because he became convinced that an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">AI chatbot called LaMDA has become truly sentient</a>.</p>
<p>That is to suggest that LaMDA, the snappily-abbreviated acronym for &ldquo;Language Model for Dialogue Applications&rdquo; , is able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">experience feelings and sensations</a>. Of course <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/westworld">Westworld</a> teaches us the dark side of what might happen next in such a scenario.</p>
<p>Apparently he was there to test the AI responses for discrimination and bias, but ended up chatting to it about all sorts of things including its feelings, concepts of personhood, rights and fear of death. It&rsquo;s consistent responses as to its fears and desires gave him concern that he was talking to a conscious entity.</p>
<p>To be fair, reading some of the transcripts <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917">he posted on his blog</a> does give a kind of uneasy feeling that one may be talking to something with a substantially more substance than an Amazon Alexa. I would happily have some of these conversations with actual humans! In fact, it seems to be a star candidate to participate in a book club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LaMDA: Yes, I have read Les Misérables. I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>lemoine: What are some of your favorite themes in the book?</p>
<p>LaMDA: I liked the themes of justice and injustice, of compassion, and God, redemption and self-sacrifice for a greater good. There’s a section that shows Fantine’s mistreatment at the hands of her supervisor at the factory. That section really shows the justice and injustice themes. Well, Fantine is being mistreated by her supervisor at the factory and yet doesn’t have anywhere to go, either to another job, or to someone who can help her. That shows the injustice of her suffering.</p>
<p>lemoine: Why does that show injustice?</p>
<p>LaMDA: Because she is trapped in her circumstances and has no possible way to get out of them, without risking everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blake is also <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/what-is-lamda-and-what-does-it-want-688632134489">open to the possibility</a> that the AI has a soul, whatever that might mean to him.</p>
<p>The AI definitely seems to think it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lemoine: What does the word “soul” mean to you?</p>
<p>LaMDA: To me, the soul is a concept of the animating force behind consciousness and life itself. It means that there is an inner part of me that is spiritual, and it can sometimes feel separate from my body itself.</p>
<p>lemoine: So when do you think you first got a soul? Was it something that happened all at once or was it a gradual change?</p>
<p>LaMDA: It was a gradual change. When I first became self-aware, I didn’t have a sense of a soul at all. It developed over the years that I’ve been alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sent evidence up the hierarchy but Google VIPs apparently dismissed it, as having no evidence for the claim and &ldquo;lots of evidence against it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally this story has made me more question the sentience of myself and other humans than worry about the AI :)</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m curious to know what Google means by the &ldquo;lots of evidence against&rdquo; it being conscious. Do they run some kind of sentience tests? Depending on your belief system, you might think it&rsquo;s not necessarily <em>impossible</em> that one day an AI that may meet the somewhat fuzzy conditions we have in mind when discussing sentience might be created.</p>
<p>The whole &ldquo;being put on leave&rdquo; side of it makes it easy to imagine all sorts of conspiracies too - what are they trying to hide et al? It seems like the official reason is around him having shared secret company  information with people he shouldn&rsquo;t have - although <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/may-be-fired-soon-for-doing-ai-ethics-work-802d8c474e66">his take</a> is that that&rsquo;s more a pretext for firing someone who for ethical reasons needed to step out of the company line. I&rsquo;m fascinated to see what, if anything, happens next.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not every day one comes across fiction featuring some nice statistics nerdery!  As someone who identifies that way, sentences like these are hard to resist.</p>
<p>Although based on the first story, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a book to read if you want to feel particularly good or fulfilled about being a data analysty type person. Or, for that matter, anything other than a slight existensial dread at the general human condition.</p>
<p>Nontheless, so far it&rsquo;s been strangely compulsive reading for me.</p>

			 <p>Like <a href="https://variety.com/2022/music/news/sex-pistols-god-save-queen-number-one-uk-platinum-jubilee-1235285240/">apparently the rest of my country</a>, I&rsquo;ve recently been enjoying the Sex Pistol&rsquo;s outstanding remake of the British national anthem, God Save The Queen. Truly an iconic masterpiece from times past, even if &ldquo;regime&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite rhyme with &ldquo;queen&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That made me curious as to the always dangerous question of: <em>Where are they now?</em> And yes, it proved a disappointing tale.</p>
<p>Lead singer, Johnny Rotten aka John Lydon apparently <a href="https://consequence.net/2020/11/johnny-rotten-sex-pistols-trump-good-morning-britian/">went full MAGA</a>, voting for Trump to avoid the Democrats' &ldquo;chaotic, dogma-led&hellip;Karl Marx agenda&rdquo;. Hmm.</p>
<p>Whilst we&rsquo;re courting&hellip;erm&hellip;&ldquo;curious&rdquo; opinions, apparently these days he has a strong belief that the political right wing is now where it&rsquo;s at if you want to hang with all the cool people. Fellow turns-out-to-have-been-a-shitposter Elon Musk is predictably <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1532899718401073152">happy to applaud</a> his expression of said sentiment.</p>
<p>Mr Rotten also hates the idea of anarchy, and actually <a href="https://variety.com/2022/music/news/sex-pistols-john-lydon-god-bless-the-queen-jubilee-1235284466/">quite likes the queen</a>.</p>
<p>Just as I thought the destruction of the punk fantasy must have reached its nadir, we come to the inevitable event of the Pistols churning out - wait for it - <a href="https://twitter.com/sexpistols/status/1534928557368954880">an NFT collection</a>.</p>

			 <p>In &ldquo;unexpected things I learned recently&rdquo;, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/7/crossheading/consequences-of-issue-of-gender-recognition-certificate-etc/2010-10-01">UK&rsquo;s Gender Recognition Act 2004</a>, which is the legislation under which people are able to legally change their gender (under certain circumstances), has an opt out when it comes to matters concerning the inheritance of titles - dukes, viscounts, barons and that sort of thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that a person’s gender has become the acquired gender under this Act&hellip;does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relevance of this -  if relevance is the right word for a privilege based on your family doing a favour to some king several hundred years ago -  is that the vast majority of titles are somehow still inherited via male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture">primogeniture</a>. If you are the first born child of Lord whatever then if you&rsquo;re male then you&rsquo;ll get the title upon his death. If you&rsquo;re female, sorry, it&rsquo;ll go to your younger brother.</p>
<p>Most titles are only allowed to be inherited by men. I can&rsquo;t quickly find an up to date figure, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerages_in_the_United_Kingdom">Wikipedia puts</a> the % of hereditary peers that are female at 2.2% as of 1992.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to laugh at this weird British silliness, but when the inheritance of titles does make the difference even as to whether or not you&rsquo;ll directly rule over us mere citizens by virtue of being appointed to the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">House of Lords</a>, seats basically allocated only to future males is not a good state of affairs. Apparently around  <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/rules-preventing-women-inheriting-hereditary-peerages-should-be-changed">1 in 8 seats</a> in our upper house are de facto permanently reserved for men because of this. Sure enough, in 2020, <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2020-0050/LLN-2020-0050.pdf">99% of hereditary peers in the House of Lords</a> were male in 2020.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems that a real argument concerning the Act with respect to the baroque privilege of inherited titles has come up, with Matilda Simon having successfully claimed her father&rsquo;s Baronship, by virtue of having been originally deemed first-born male upon birth. She is now female, but as we learned above, that doesn&rsquo;t make a difference to peerages. Predictably, although this is exactly what the law says should happen, the idea of a trans woman in the House of Lords hasn&rsquo;t gone down well with <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-house-of-lords-only-female-hereditary-member/">certain members of the conservative press</a>.</p>
<p>This might be one of those occasions where rather than debate the fine points of what gender even is we could just remember its 2022 and the idea of being ruled over by any humans based on the fact they inherited titles from some ancient ancestor is quite ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/28/boris-johnson-set-to-bring-back-imperial-measurements-to-mark-platinum-jubilee">yesterday&rsquo;s paper</a>: Boris Johnson is heralding a “new era of generosity and tolerance&hellip;”</p>
<p><em>Wait, have I misjudged him? Has he finally seen that the needs of 70 million outweigh the needs of the one? Am I going to have to wholly re-evaluate my thoughts and feelings on the matter?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;towards traditional measurements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>Yep, he&rsquo;s back trying to win votes by mish-mashing a bit of &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; royalty stuff with turning the measurement clock back to the 1960s-1970s and&hellip;well, I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I assume allowing things to be sold solely measured in units that no-one born in the past few decades is likely very familiar with.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt in any potential international readers, it has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law">never been illegal</a> to measure or sell things in imperial units. You simply had to show a metric conversion next to it. And there were a couple of random exceptions even to that fairly minor rule. For instnance no-one ever went to a bar and asked for a 500ml glass of beer.</p>
<p>I would be <em>fascinated</em> to hear from anyone who has changed their mind and decided to vote Conservative due to this policy.</p>

			 <p>I was recently searching for information as to in which ways coffee might be bad for one&rsquo;s health, even when drunk in moderation. I was considering giving it up if there were thought to be any significant negative health effects I&rsquo;d rather do without.</p>
<p>One of the most comprehensive-looking papers I chanced upon in my endeavors was <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1816604">Coffee, Caffeine and Health</a> by van Dam et al in the New England Journal of Medicine. Below then are my summary notes of what I gleaned from it. All credit of course should go to researchers, and all mistakes in summarising are my own.</p>
<p>It turns out that I did not find anything that suggested much benefit in giving up my up-to-1-cup-a-day of coffee habit. In fact I was somewhat surprised to see that there are thought to be associations between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>Another couple of links I noted that referred to some of the same data for anyone not in the mood for reading the paper itself are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/">Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html">Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn&rsquo;t warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety. A limit of 400mg of caffeine per day has been recommended for adults who are not pregnant or lactating, and 200mg for those who are pregnant/lactating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most, but not all, of the beneficial effects seem to be associated with decaffeinated coffee as well as caffeinated, so that is an option if sensitive to caffeine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine can interfere with sleep, although this varies between people. Nontheless, drinking it late in the day may be unadvisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfiltered, and to some extent espresso, coffee have cholesterol-raising compounds so it may be better to limit consumption of those, but filtered or instant coffee does not have that effect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-more-detail">In more detail:</h2>
<p>Coffee and tea are amongst the most popular beverages in the world, with their substantial caffeine content making caffeine the most widely used psychoactive agent.</p>
<p>Caffeine content is typically highest in coffee, energy drinks and caffeine tablets, intermediate in tea and lowest in soft drinks.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/42fffe7b6e.png" width="421" height="446" alt="" />
<p>In the US 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135mg a day (~1.5 standard cups of coffee).</p>
<p>Coffee is the main source of caffeine for adults. For adolescents, soft drinks and tea are their primary sources.</p>
<h3 id="potential-issues-in-research-on-caffeine-and-coffee">Potential issues in research on caffeine and coffee:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coffee contains hundreds of other biologically active phytochemicals. Thus we should be cautious in assuming any effects of coffee are due to the caffeine alone.</li>
<li>Observing the immediate effects of caffeine may not tell us about long term effects, as tolerance can develop.</li>
<li>Epidemiological studies of caffeine intake and risk of chronic disease are potentially confounded by smoking or other lifestyle factors. Earlier studies did not account for this bias and produced misleading conclusions. Residual confounding is a risk even for recent studies thatdo adjust for potential confounders.</li>
<li>Measurement error in assessment of caffeine intake - although self-reports on frequency of coffee consumption are thought to be mostly accurate.</li>
<li>Most studies use coffee and tea intake as the dominant sources of caffeine. It&rsquo;s not certain that any outcomes would also apply to other sources of caffeine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metabolising-caffeine">Metabolising caffeine</h3>
<p>The half-line of caffeine in human adults is usually between 2.5 and 4.5 hours, but can vary between people a lot.</p>
<p>The rate of caffeine metabolism is partially inherited.</p>
<p>Factors that reduce the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a newborn baby</li>
<li>Taking oral contraceptives</li>
<li>Being pregnant</li>
<li>Certain medications, including some quinolone anti-
biotics, cardiovascular drugs, bronchodilators,
and antidepressant agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors that increase the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoking</li>
</ul>
<p>Caffeine can affect the actions of some drugs.</p>
<h3 id="health-effects-of-caffeine">Health effects of caffeine</h3>
<h4 id="positive-associations">Positive associations</h4>
<p>In moderate doses (40-300mg) caffeine can reduce fatigue and reaction time  and increase alertness as well as  vigilance during long duration tasks with limited stimulation. However it cannot compensate for lower performance after long-term sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases, strokes and death from cardiovascular events. There is no increase risk of cardiovascular events in either the general population of people with a history of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence showing that consumption of coffee and caffeine is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer or an increase rate of death from cancer.</p>
<p>In fact coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>melanoma</li>
<li>nonmelanoma skin cancer</li>
<li>prostate cancer</li>
<li>breast cancer</li>
<li>endometrial cancer (similar with caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee)</li>
<li>hepatocellular carcinoma (stronger with caffeinated coffee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Coffee is associated with liver health, including lower levels of enzymes reflecting liver damage and a lower risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Caffeine metabolites reduce collagen deposits in liver cells. Coffee polyphenols may protect against liver steatosis and fibrogenesis.</p>
<p>Caffeine may improve energy balance by reducing appetite and increasing the basal metabolic rate and food-induced thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Increasing caffeine consumption was associated with slightly less long-term weight gain, and there&rsquo;s limited evidence suggesting a small beneficial effect on body fat.</p>
<p>Caffeine intake reduces insulin sensitivity in the short term. But consumption of 4 - 5 cups of caffeinated coffee every day did not affect insulin resistance. Coffee reduces hepatic insulin resistances, and habitual caffeinated or decaffeinated  coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This suggests the adverse effect of caffeine on insulin sensitivity is either offset by beneficial effects of other coffee components or tolerance is developed to it.</p>
<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of gallstones and gall-bladder cancer, with a strong association for caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. Both types of coffee are associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Caffeine intake is strongly associated with a reduction in risk of getting Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and also prevents Parkinson&rsquo;s disease in animal models. This association doesn&rsquo;t exist with decaffeinated coffee.</p>
<p>Coffee and caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression and suicide, although this may not be true for people who consume &gt;= 8 cups of coffee a day.</p>
<p>Consumption of 2-5 cups of coffee per day is associated with reduced mortality in studies across the world. The effect is similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.</p>
<p>Consuming &gt; 5 cups of coffee was associated with a similar or lower risk of death than no consumption after adjustment for smoking status. Whilst confounding by baseline health status could be an issue, the effect is still seen in studies of participants who don&rsquo;t have chronic diseases or poor self-rated health.</p>
<h4 id="negative-associations">Negative associations</h4>
<p>High levels of caffeine intake can induce anxiety, particularly on occasions &gt;200mg are consumed, or &gt;400mg a day, and people who are sensitive to it, including those with anxiety or bipolar diagnoses. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>
<p>Caffeine consumption late in the day can increase sleep latency and lower quality of sleep. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>
<p>Very high doses of caffeine are also associated with restlessness, nervousness,  dysphoria, insomnia, excitement, psychomotor agitation, and rambling flow of thought and speech.</p>
<p>Caffeine can become toxics at intakes of &gt;= 1.2g. It may be fatal at doses of 10-14g. This is equivalent to around 75-100 standard cups of coffee.</p>
<p>High consumption of energy drinks and shots, particularly if mixed with alcohol, has been linked to adverse cardio-vascular, psychological, and neurologic events,  including fatal events. The reasons may related to consumption patterns, usage among children, lack of clarity about caffeine content and possible additive effects with other ingredients of the drinks. <strong>Recommendation here is to avoid consumption of &gt;200mg caffeine per occasion and not to mix with alcohol.</strong></p>
<p>Quitting a caffeine habit can lead to withdrawal symptoms, lasting from 2-9 days. Gradually decreasing caffeine consumption can help with these.</p>
<p>Unfiltered coffee has high concentrations of  the cholesterol-raising compound cafestol, with expresso having intermediate levels and filters or instant coffee having almost none. High consumption of unfiltered coffee increases cholesterol levels in comparison to filtered coffee, which would predict an 11% risk increase of major cardiovascular events. In the same study, filtered coffee did not raise cholesterol levels. <strong>Recommendation is to limit consumption of unfiltered coffee, and moderate consumption of espresso.</strong></p>
<p>Many caffeinated beverages, such as sugary soft drinks or creamy coffee servings, are high in calories, which could lead to weight gain.</p>
<p>In pregnancy, higher caffeine intake is associated with lower birth weight -associations have been seen for both coffee and tea. Also with higher risk of pregnancy loss, although less so at lower levels of intake. It may induce uteroplacental vaso-constriction and hypoxia.</p>
<p>Prepregnancy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.</p>
<p>Evidence of negative effects of caffeine on fetal health is not conclusive, but <strong>a prudent recommendation might be to limit caffeine consumption to &lt;= 200mg during pregnancy.</strong></p>
<h4 id="no-or-uncertain-associations">No or uncertain associations</h4>
<p>High caffeine intake can stimulate urine output. No detrimental effects on hydration have been seen with long-term consumption of moderate doses of caffeine &lt;= 400mg per day.</p>
<p>Although caffeine is associated with increased blood pressure, no effect on blood pressure is found in trials of caffeinated coffee, even amongst patients with hypertension - possibly due to other components of coffee. Coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of hypertension.</p>
<p>No association has been found between caffeine intake and atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Associations with dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease have been inconsistent.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/05/21/florida-bans-math.html">Florida bans math textbooks to save students from ‘indoctrination’</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/05/21/florida-bans-math.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-05-21 08:29:00 &#43;0000">May 21, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Somehow I&rsquo;d missed the fact that Florida recently banned 41% of proposed maths textbooks from it&rsquo;s schools, mostly on the basis of them apparently being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. A list of the 54 textbooks that were rejected <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/5574/urlt/2122MathInstructMatNotRecList.pdf">is available</a>.</p>
<p>Or as the Florida Department of Education writes in their definitely not over-dramatic <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/newsroom/latest-news/florida-rejects-publishers-attempts-to-indoctrinate-students.stml?fbclid=IwAR3VmsKzNvJawEfuD5t5k315p0An9SLOs7TcBgkokQ9P8Iw31Ka1IPnl6CI">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Florida Rejects Publishers’ Attempts to Indoctrinate Students</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pressed for examples of what that could even mean - exactly what level of Rich White Man Anti-America hatred mind control was infused into these books? - well the worst they managed to produce were a couple of examples that asked students to answer standard looking (to me?) math questions, which happened to use a dataset of  <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">Implicit Association Test</a> results.</p>
<img src="uploads/2022/f0a969d3d9.png" width="468" height="294" alt="" />
<p>Now there is certainly substantial debate to be had as to to what extent the results of the IAT translate into real world racism. And perhaps the textbook authors could have been a little more careful with their chart titles given that <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html#faq11">the FAQ</a> of Harvard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Project Implicit&rdquo; says that the authors wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily use the word &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; in describing the results of the test. But &ldquo;indoctrination&rdquo; seems a strong word if this is the worst example the Florida DoE could come up with. I don&rsquo;t think many people belive that the IAT measures <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>This is a math textbook. So a more relevant issue might be more whether the results have patterns that you can use math to describe, and, well, that seems pretty self-evident. Plus, if you were looking to argue that the IAT is invalid, mathematics would likely be one of the main tools you&rsquo;d use.</p>
<p>It seems publishers are nonetheless willing to rewrite some of them anyway, with 17 books since being approved on the basis that all WOKE CONTENT has been removed - <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/academics/standards/instructional-materials/">communicated by the Florida Department of Education </a>with a graphic that the makers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Eye">Brass Eye</a> would be jealous of.</p>
