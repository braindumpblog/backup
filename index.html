			 <p>This year is the 100 year anniversary of the birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, Britain&rsquo;s all-too-famous Prime Minister between 1979 and 1990.</p>
<p>The last thing I feel inclined to do, given her &lsquo;<a href="https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/24944153.50-years-see-appalling-legacy-thatcher/">appalling legacy</a>&rsquo;, is attend the upcoming &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czr83v718ejo">Festival of Thatcher</a>&rdquo;. Even if there is beer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A council meeting earlier heard ideas being suggested for the festival, including themed beers with names such as Iron Lady or Grantham Lass, which would &ldquo;relate to the Thatcher experience&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right up there with the &ldquo;unadulterated shambles&rdquo; that was the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/unadulterated-shambles-probe-launched-into-120m-festival-of-brexit-12717761">Festival of Brexit</a>.</p>

			 <p>Another<a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/9-rules-for-new-technology"> interesting article from The Honest Broker</a> goes through Wendell Berry&rsquo;s &ldquo;nine reasonable requirements for new tech&rdquo; list. The list might be nearly 40 years old by now, but it seems to have maintained its relevance as we make present-day technology decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The new tool should be cheaper than the one it replaces.</li>
<li>It should be at least as small in scale as the one it replaces.</li>
<li>It should do work that is clearly and demonstrably better than the one it replaces.</li>
<li>It should use less energy than the one it replaces.</li>
<li>If possible, it should use some form of solar energy, such as that of the body.</li>
<li>It should be repairable by a person of ordinary intelligence, provided that he or she has the necessary tools.</li>
<li>It should be purchasable and repairable as near to home as possible.</li>
<li>⁠It should come from a small, privately owned shop or store that will take it back for maintenance and repair.⁠</li>
<li>⁠It should come from a small, privately owned shop or store that will take it back for maintenance and repair.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Wendell used them to come to the conclusion that he<a href="http://tipiglen.co.uk/berrynot.html"> didn&rsquo;t really want to replace his typewriter with a computer</a> (although I&rsquo;m not sure how tenable or acceptable the &ldquo;get your wife to use the typewriter&rdquo; take really is; something several other people also noted).</p>
<p>But more generally, in the modern era, where &ldquo;should you have a computer?&rdquo; is not really up for debate any more, most of them remain a useful yardstick to consider technology being developed today against.</p>
<p>And in Gioia&rsquo;s view, each one of them highlights the vast array of places where many of technology companies are currently failing us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;.the failure of tech companies to meet his modest demands is now painfully evident to everybody.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I totally agree with the main thrust of <a href="https://www.honest-broker.com/p/the-worlds-largest-search-doesnt">this article from The Honest Broker</a> - that Google is increasingly less a useful way to search for links on topics that interest you, not least due to their incessant desire to keep you on their site.</p>
<p>But it was this passage from Ted Gioia that caught my attention as being both insightful and a catchy summary of one vision of how our digital life is changing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost everything in the digital world is turning into its opposite.</p>
<p>Social media platforms now prevent people from having a social life.</p>
<p>ChatGPT makes you less likely to chat with anybody.</p>
<p>Relationship apps make it harder for couples to form lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Health and wellness websites make it almost impossible to find reliable health advice—instead peddling products of dubious efficacy.</p>
<p>Product review sites now prevent people from reading impartial reviews by actual users of the product, instead operating as pay-for-play vehicles.</p>
<p>Etc. etc. etc.</p>

			 <p>📚Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781788856720">Queen Macbeth</a> by Val McDermid.</p>
<p>This short book tells a new episode from the world of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth">Macbeth</a>. But, him having apparently died in battle before the main story starts, it&rsquo;s about the adventures of his surviving wife and the women around her as they seek refuge from would-be killers greedy to take the throne for themselves.</p>
<p>To be honest I don&rsquo;t remember enough about the play for the references to be particularly meaningful to me - but even with that it&rsquo;s a perfectly readable and enjoyable story that&rsquo;s quick to get through.</p>

<p>Louis Theroux is back in his indomitable style, this time (re)visiting the extremely nationalist Israeli settlers who are trying to build their homes in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank - <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm">contrary to international law</a>.</p>
<p>We learn about the lives of the settlers, their dreams of the settlment-buildings, along with the inverse side; what it now means try and live your life as a Palestinian in the West Bank. It&rsquo;s obviously a very relevant-to-current-times documentary, about a topic that we should all want to learn about.  Available on BBC iPlayer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Flint et al write regarding the potential link between neurodiversity and having obesity; a correlation I was not previously aware of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2024, analysis of Health Survey for England data between 2016 and 2019 identified that participants with neurodiversity were almost 64% more likely to have obesity than the general population, and that this likelihood increased to 70% for participants with a learning disability.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of 95 studies examined weight status in autistic people and people with ADHD. The pooled estimates of the prevalence of obesity and overweight were 21·8% and 19·8% in autistic people, and 14·7% and 20·9% in people with ADHD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? It&rsquo;s early days on this subject I&rsquo;m sure - but they put forward a few claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several factors contribute to the high prevalence of obesity and atypical weight gain in people with neurodiversity, such as genetic variants, eating behaviour (including preference for caloric-dense foods), sensory sensitivities affecting food tastes and textures, health-care experiences, stigma, and weight-promoting medications. People with neurodiversity are also at increased risk of obesity-related complications, such as sleep apnoea, type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal disturbances, orthopaedic problems, and psychological disorders (eg, depression, anxiety, social isolation, and stigma).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always: more research is needed! Right now very little explicitly examines this population.</p>

			 <p>From the scrapbook of &ldquo;this must be an <a href="https://theonion.com/">Onion</a> article; oh no turns out it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-veterans-day-world-war-i.html">renames V-E day</a> -aka<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/ckg25gwy635o"> Victory in Europe day</a>, the commemoration of the end of World War 2 - &ldquo;Victory Day for World War II&rdquo; because he doesn&rsquo;t like how the word &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; features in the original. Presumably he doesn&rsquo;t understand the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; either.</p>
<p>Part of his reasoning is apparently America basically won it on its own. And isn&rsquo;t military or jingoistic or obsessed with itself enough just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veteran&rsquo;s Day also also to be known as the far less comprehensive and catchy name &ldquo;Victory Day for World War I&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He then reflects that the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">US Declaration of Independence</a> is &ldquo;is a <a href="https://vt.co/news/us/president-donald-trumps-attempt-to-describe-what-declaration-of-independence-is-leaves-people-baffled">declaration of unity and love</a>&rdquo;. Of course it is in fact the opposite - a declaration of&hellip;umm&hellip;independence; <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Declaration-of-Independence">the separation of the United States from English rule</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, following <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqj42vd1rxlo">the death of the pope</a>, Trump&rsquo;s White House shares <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg8zkz8d0o">an AI generated picture of himself</a> dressed as the pope. Yes, it seems he wants to be the pope. He&rsquo;s not Catholic of course nor a cardinal but hey, he is Trump and pope sounds important and fancy and comes with a residence full of expensive things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally for today, a confirmation that he believes that the letters annotating the tattoo of Abrego Garcia&rsquo;s hand that he is claiming is evidence of his affiliation with the gang MS-13 are literally real. As in that the labels actually appear on the guy&rsquo;s hand rather than being obviously superimposed typed-on annotations of the actual photo. Or as Gizmodo put it: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-really-believes-his-fake-ms-13-tattoo-photo-is-real-2000596365">Trump Really Believes His Fake ‘MS-13 Tattoo’ Photo Is Real</a></p>

<p>In case you too can&rsquo;t process visual images in a rational way, it<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-ms13-photo-abrego-garcia/"> has been confirmed</a> that the letters are annotations. Not to mention that &ldquo;There was no clear evidence the symbols on Abrego Garcia&rsquo;s fingers proved an affiliation with MS-13&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The annotations also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-really-believes-his-fake-ms-13-tattoo-photo-is-real-2000596365">don&rsquo;t appear</a> on any other photographs of Abrego Garcia.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781761422621">Elon Musk</a> by Walter Isaacson.</p>
<p>This is one of the more famous biographies of Elon Musk so far. Reading it is part of my ill-fated efforts to understand what on Earth is driving the people who are causing life in 2025 to be far more horrific than it needs to be; to comprehend the incomprehensible. See also: <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/04/06/hillbilly-elegy-is-an-entirely.html">Hillbilly Elegy</a>.</p>
<p>Although when an unwitting colleague found out I had mainlined my reading straight from Vance into Musk they gently enquired whether perhaps I needed a wellness check. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Of course the biography wasn&rsquo;t written yesterday. It was published in 2023 - so somewhat before the guy in question fully started literally dancing like a puppet on Trump&rsquo;s election stage and using a chainsaw to diminish the power and reputation of the former world superpower known as the United States.</p>
<p>That said, the book is recent enough to describe some of his descent into conspiracy madness and new-found affiliation with some of illiberal ideas and powerbrokers of today - along with his ability to make extremely cringe and society-destroying tweets.</p>
<p>At one point his brother apparently felt compelled to lock Elon&rsquo;s phone in a hotel safe to keep him away from overnight text-based destruction. Presumably unable to survive even one night without the ability to type &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; underneath a random proto-Nazi tweet, Musk called hotel security to bust into the safe.</p>
<p>It certainly covers his acquisition of Twitter in detail, along with SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal and the other businesses that made him rich and famous. Most of these things weren&rsquo;t his invention of course. The guy who <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/tesla-ceo-settles-for-founder-title/2088887/">sued people to make them call him Tesla&rsquo;s founder</a> as opposed to what he really was, an early investor, is not shy of taking credit for all the great wonders of the world.</p>
<p>But of course none of these Great Men of Modern HIstory were really self-made. He did not invent Paypal, nor Tesla, nor Twitter. In fact his association with Paypal was really down to his own attempt to create a company doing something similar, called - wait for it - x.com - failed. Unfortunately he still owns the URL as it turns out.</p>
<p>Of course, whatever one&rsquo;s opinion of Elon is, I don&rsquo;t mean to give him no credit.   Indisputably some of his particular talents drove progress on some of these projects onwards. And (some of) this may have been a wonderful thing if the original missions around saving humanity, helping the environment and so on had remained his focus. And we ignore the way he abused people along the way.</p>
<p>Of course it is extremely hard for me to read the book without a certain amount of prejudice and bias, knowing what came next. That said, I think I would, even without Musk&rsquo;s recent ventures into what passes for politics these days, have felt the author gave him a bit too easy of a time. Perhaps this comes from the fact it&rsquo;s clear that</p>
<p>The general vibe once we get past his childhood is that of a tortured genius. That he might abuse his workers, his family, his friends, especially when overtaken by one of his dark moods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon’s moods would cycle through light and dark, intense and goofy, detached and emotional, with occasional plunges into what those around him dreaded as “demon mode.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He might take shortcuts that don&rsquo;t work out, break laws, inadvertently blow up things, fall out with his family and the like. But that it&rsquo;s all in the service of something greater.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This emotional shutoff valve could make him callous, but it also made him a risk-seeking innovator. “He learned to shut down fear,” she says. “If you turn off fear, then maybe you have to turn off other things, like joy or empathy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The takeaway seems to be that we should somehow tolerate the harm and havoc he wreaks on those around him - at least the the chunks of his impulsivity and cruelty that are detailed here - because we need the visionary successes that those allowances permit him to make.</p>
<p>But do we? Do we actually? Even now?</p>
<p>Some of this bias probably comes from who the author had access to. The book is very detailed and he clearly had access to a ton of the high-powered folk that surrounded Elon. So it&rsquo;s useful and educational on that front. But there&rsquo;s not so much from for instance a random worker on the Tesla manufacture floor or the group of people that wanted to unionise. To be fair there is a mention of the workplace injury rate being higher than elsewhere, but it&rsquo;s not really dug into.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not that the book doesn&rsquo;t document his business and personal failings. It&rsquo;s just that it seems to very often excuse them. Although there is enough detail that I think if you just knew Elon as a genius inventor who simply wants to save humanity you will learn a lot about how and why he does what he does, and the flaws that come along for the ride.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the audaciousness and hubris that drive him to attempt epic feats excuse his bad behavior, his callousness, his recklessness? The times he&rsquo;s an asshole? The answer is no, of course not. One can admire a person&rsquo;s good traits and decry the bad ones. But it&rsquo;s also important to understand how the strands are woven together, sometimes tightly. It can be hard to remove the dark ones without unraveling the whole cloth. As Shakespeare teaches us, all heroes have flaws, some tragic, some conquered, and those we cast as villains can be complex.</p>
<p>Even the best people, he wrote, are &ldquo;molded out of faults”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did learn some things from this book that could be useful in understanding what came next.</p>
<p>His childhood seems to have been very difficult, growing up in a challenging place at a violent time with an extraordinarily abusive father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Errol Musk, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist who to this day bedevils Elon.
&hellip;
He would end every tirade by telling Elon how pathetic he was. Elon would just have to stand there, not allowed to leave. “It was mental torture,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was horribly bullied by his peers and his parents.  Isaacson suggests that this why he became obsessed with owning the grown-up playground of bullies that is Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there were two other reasons, I think, that Musk wanted to own Twitter. The first was a simple one. It was fun, like an amusement park. It offered political smackdowns, intellectual gladiator matches, dopey memes, important public announcements, valuable marketing, bad puns, and unfiltered opinions. Are you not entertained?</p>
<p>And second, I believe there was a psychological, personal yearing. Twitter was the ultimate playground. As a kid, he was beaten and bullied on the playground, never having been endowed with the emotional dexterity needed to thrive on that rugged terrain. It instilled a deep pain and sometimes caused him to react to slights far too emotionally, but it also is what girded him to be able to face the world and fight every battle fiercely. When he felt dinged up, cornered, bullied, either online or in person, it took him back to a place that was super painful, where he was dissed by his father and bullied by his classmates. But now he could own the playground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He at least self-identifies as having certain issues of the mind. Along with I think <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/asperger-syndrome-elon-musk-autism-spectrum-disorder-1590043">Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome</a>, although it isn&rsquo;t clear to me that he was ever diagnosed with it, or anything else that he seems to be exhibiting the signs of.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty detailed about his way of working that clearly foreshadowed what he would do to the US state, not that it seems there was really a way of avoiding this unelected leader of a fake government department doing what he does.</p>
<p>Musk is a big fan of removing things, deleting things, cancelling and cutting anything that might not be technically essential given the laws of physics. He will bully engineers to do that no matter how much of a bad idea they think it is. If it goes wrong then, fine, it goes wrong. In the book he repeatedly states that he believes that if you&rsquo;re not having to undo 10% of the cuts you make then you&rsquo;re not cutting enough.</p>
<p>This of course might work well for developing a new flange for a car or whatever, but I&rsquo;m not so sure it&rsquo;s so easy to undo, for instance, mass firings within the public sector. He is drawn to, obsessed by, taking risks. When it comes to public &ldquo;service&rdquo; and society though, perhaps some risks are not worth taking.</p>
<p>His penchant for censorship and persecution, despite his <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/29/elon-musks-free.html">hypocritical pronouncements on free speech</a> is likewise nothing new. After he purchased Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They agreed that the next priority would be identifying and firing those who were not trustworthy, or more specifically, those who did not seem to be completely loyal to Musk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team began going over the Slack messages and social media postings of Twitter employees, focusing on those who had high levels of access to the software stack. &ldquo;He told us to find the people who might be disgruntled or a threat,&rdquo; Dhaval says. They searched for keywords, including &ldquo;Elon,&rdquo; on the public Slack channel.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780191606687">Jung - A Very Short Introduction</a> by Anthony Stevens.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the title sounds like. It covers the key concepts formulated and developed by the influential Swiss psychotherapist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl Jung</a>.</p>
<p>You may have heard of several of these. The list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>synchronicity</li>
<li>archetypes</li>
<li>the collective unconscious</li>
<li>the shadow</li>
<li>the persona</li>
<li>psychological types</li>
<li>dream interpretation</li>
<li>anima &amp; animus</li>
<li>plus our inner goal - the individuation of the Self.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was particularly intrigued by the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">archetypes</a>. Jung believed that we all inherit knowledge and experiences from our forebears - the collective unconscious. These ideas are expressed as symbols and archetypes that transcend cultures - although naturally different cultures will name them differently.</p>
<p>Example archetypes mentioned in the book and/or elsewhere include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the mother</li>
<li>the father</li>
<li>the maiden</li>
<li>the hero</li>
<li>the child</li>
<li>the trickster</li>
<li>the wise old man</li>
<li>the innocent</li>
<li>the orphan</li>
<li>the caregiver</li>
<li>the explorer</li>
<li>the rebel</li>
<li>the lover</li>
<li>the ruler</li>
</ul>
<p>and no doubt many more. I&rsquo;m curious to what extent the presence of archetypes across cultures has been studied since Jung&rsquo;s type - this seems like an aspect of psychoanalysis that would be relatively easy to validate. At a glance it seems like some <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4217606/">studies</a> have since validated the usefulness of Jungian therapy in general, although it certainly has its critics who would claim that evidence remains rather lacking and the practice rather unstudied.</p>
<p>The book also details something of Jung&rsquo;s biography. He had a somewhat strange childhood which no doubt was formative in the development of his later ideas. There&rsquo;s also a chapter on to what extent he was antisemitic. We learn also about what is involved in a session of Jungian analysis.</p>
<p>I listened to, rather than read this, which was probably a mistake. Being a &ldquo;very short introduction&rdquo; each section proceeds rather quickly. I had to rewind very frequently to make sure I didn&rsquo;t miss too much. But I do believe my understanding of the gentleman, his thoughts and theory is still much improved from a previously negligible baseline.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9798217014323">Autocracy, Inc.</a> by Anne Applebaum.</p>
<p>In this book I believe Anne Applebaum adeptly identifies what underlies a lot of what underlies our various contemporary geopolitical permacrisis - including what is new and different about it vs past times.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy">Autocracies</a> have of course existed since time immemorial. The key tenet defining them is that the ruler - usually, and by some definitions it must be, a single person-  has all the power. They hold absolute power over their citizens and institutions. They choose what rights their citizens have, how they must behave, who gets punished and how, along with everything they care about regarding how the country in question is run.</p>
<p>If they hold elections, they are meaningless. There is no &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; process to displace the power of the autocrat. They stay until they&rsquo;ve had enough, or die. The only thing that constrains them is what needs to be done to preserve their power.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/The-spread-of-democracy-in-the-20th-century">rise of democracies</a>, plenty of autocracies still exist today. Applebaum includes Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Angola, Myanmar, Cuba, Syria, Zimbabwe, Mali, Belarus, Sudan, Azerbaijan and others in her list.</p>
<p>However she no longer believes the traditional &ldquo;one bad guy in charge&rdquo; setup is what is going on with the modern incarnations. Instead autocracies are enabled by sophisticated networks,  kleptocratic financial structures, miscellaneous security services and technologists expect in surveillance, propaganda and disinformation.</p>
<p>Traditionally the autocrat might confine themselves within the borders of their country. They might have very different ideologies and goals from their peers. Autocrats might be  communists, monarchists, nationalists, theocrats or something else.</p>
<p>But, also novel these days, they are nonetheless connected to each other across the globe. They reinforce each other&rsquo;s power, irrespective of ideology, sharing resources, strategies and propaganda with each other. Their goal is still only to do what is in the interest of preserving their own wealth and power; not to spread an ideologically throughout the world. It so happens that collaborating with other autocrats is an effective way to support this. It&rsquo;s a transactional relationship, absent are any dreams of a common society.</p>
<p>The general tactics of the autocrat involve silencing their citizens, pushing back against transparency or accountability, and repressing anyone - local or abroad - that challenges them. They live in expensive mansions and often operate for-profit ventures.</p>
<p>Their international collaboration with each other comes the desire to promote the ideas that will keep them in power, keep their wealth growing, and discredit any threat - international or local, physical, financial or cultural - that might challenge them.</p>
<p>The collaborate across borders to each other lessen the effects of sanctions, exchange the technologies of repression, happy to assist each other in getting richer and keep each other in power - for self-interested reasons if no other.</p>
<p>This whole structure is what Applebaum refers to as &ldquo;Autocracy Inc.&rdquo;. The autocratic network can be considered as an entity in the vein of a modern corporation.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the modern autocrat is their focus on impunity. The new autocrats feel secure, that they don&rsquo;t have to persuade other countries or their own population of the correctness of their vision. They don&rsquo;t even try to. They simply don&rsquo;t care about criticism, internal or external, and will often openly brutalise their opponents and wantonly defy international law. For which they are rarely severely punished by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Their main common enemy is the democratic world at large, and international organisations such as NATO, the EU, as well as the very ideas of liberalism. Liberal ideas are innately attractive to some of even the most repressed population. They thus look for ways to discredit the concepts concerned; to give the impression that hey, you might not like how your country is going, how we force you to live your lives, but it&rsquo;s necessary - there is no better alternative.</p>
<p>Autocrats have no belief in a neutral law, an independent judiciary or press. Anyone who critiques them is a disloyal traitor.</p>
<p>An all-too contemporary example of such a nefarious gathering is of course Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. The democratic world did pull together to some extent; sanctions were instigated, arms were provided to Ukraine, Sweden and Finland joined NATO. But another alliance set out to help Russia one way or another. Applebaum lists China, Iran, North Korea, Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Mali, and the Central African Republic, Belarus, Turkey, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,  Kazakhstan and India as all giving some level of material support to the Russian aggression.</p>
<p>And of course in today&rsquo;s connected world their discrediting of liberalism can spread to other countries, risking bringing their democratic processes into question.</p>
<p>What can be done about it? This is where I struggle to feel much hope given the level of collaboration likely required in today&rsquo;s polarised world - but she valiantly provides a few ideas. A lot of it is around democracies finding a way to unite and support each other, just as the autocrats do.</p>
<p>Address autocracy as an idea, not a set of instances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;think about the struggle for freedom not as a competition with specific autocratic states, and certainly not as “war with China,” but as a war against autocratic behaviors. wherever they are found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She puts out a call for:</p>
<ul>
<li>networks of lawyers and public officials to fight corruption.</li>
<li>democratic activists who understand kleptocracy.</li>
<li>military and intelligence coalitions that can predict and stop lawless violence.</li>
<li>economic experts who can track the impact of sanctions, determine who is breaking them and stop them.</li>
<li>people who can organise online and coordinate campaigns to debunk propaganda.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, to stop promoting what is effectively &ldquo;transactional kleptocracy&rdquo;, something she rightly claims that much of &ldquo;The West&rdquo; is guilty of.</p>
<p>Financial transactions should be transparent. We should be able to know who owns every company, who benefits from every trust. We should prevent our own citizens hiding money secretive jurisdictions or working to enable others to do so.</p>
<p>Our enforcement teams should be strong and well-resourced. We should not allow the wealthy to conduct business with autocrats and then come back and do further business with democracies, all while enjoying the privileges of citizenship and legal protection that come from democratic life.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t pretend any of this is easy. It&rsquo;s clear that most of it fundamentally requires international collaboration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the democratic world once built an international anticommunist alliance, so can the United States and its allies build an international anticorruption alliance, organized around the idea of transparency, accountability, and fairness, enhanced by the creative thinking found in the autocratic diasporas as well as the democracies themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, the autocratic information war must be undermined. Fact checking is necessary but not sufficient. With the rise social media and the expertise of autocratic propagandists there is no longer a &ldquo;free market of ideas&rdquo; that will promote the good ideas over the bad, the truth over fiction. People are actively drawn to conspiracy theories and other types of disinformation.</p>
<p>Social media platforms are somewhat to blame. Their algorithms are too easy for the propagandists to game. They must be reformed. Social media platforms should be transparent, allow users to own and control their own data as well as to influence the algorithms that determine what a user sees. Independent scientists must be allowed enough inner access to the system to enable them to understand their impact.</p>
<p>Without breaching our own principles we should also do our best to connect to audiences that may be receptive to anti-autocratic ideas with what they care about. Leverage the power of emotion. Show how fighting truth can bring change.</p>
<p>The democratic world must also decouple and de-risk from autocracies. We have recently learned what it means to be dependent on Russia&rsquo;s gas. Either withdraw fully or, as a minimum, don&rsquo;t become dependent on the goodwill of an autocrat.</p>
<p>Regulation will be key as a new world of repressive technologies continues to be developed - surveillance,  AI, face recognition and so on.</p>
<p>Her final message is to emphasise that this fight is real and necessary. If the rise of the autocracies seems remote to you, then it isn&rsquo;t, or at least it might not be for long. Even if you selfishly care nothing for the plight of those currently suffering under autocracies, no-one can assume that the democracy they live in is safe.</p>
<p>A country isolating itself from the world won&rsquo;t work. Using &ldquo;realism&rdquo; as an excuse to fail to take geopolitical action is simply an excuse used by people that don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no liberal world order anymore, and the aspiration to create one no longer seems real. But there are liberal societies, open and free countries that offer a better chance for people to live useful lives than closed dictatorships do.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Those that exist have deep flaws, profound divisions, and terrible historical scars. But that’s all the more reason to defend and protect them.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>They can be destroyed from the outside and from the inside, too, by division and demagogues. Or they can be saved. But only if those of us who live in them are willing to make the effort to save them.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781108590099">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments</a> by Ron Kohavi.</p>
<p>This is a very comprehensive book about running experiments. The heavy focus is on the modern type of online experiment where you might want to use thousands or millions of users who interact with an app or website in order to detect sometimes very small behavioural effects.</p>
<p>This contrasts with many of the previous books on experiments and statistics I&rsquo;ve read that often assume you have maybe 30 in-person participants you&rsquo;re looking to study in a lab. It also focuses a bit less on the statistics and a bit more on the practicalities of design and implementation, although there&rsquo;s plenty of stats to get your teeth into as well.</p>
<p>The authors also share plenty of examples, usually from the big tech companies, so you can see how the experts apply these lessons to make their decisions.</p>
<p>To be honest, you can get a decent idea of what&rsquo;s included from the chapter titles. Here we go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction and Motivation: Why experiment? What are the basic ingredients of doing so?</li>
<li>Running and Analyzing Experiments: An End-to-End Example</li>
<li>Twyman’s Law and Experimentation Trustworthiness: Twyman&rsquo;s law is &ldquo;Any figure that looks interesting or different is usually wrong&rdquo;, so this is all about misinterpretation and validity.</li>
<li>Experimentation Platform and Culture: Maturity models and tools.</li>
<li>Speed Matters: An End-to-End Case Study: Why platform performance matters.</li>
<li>Organizational Metrics: The principles and practice of selecting metrics to measure.</li>
<li>Metrics for Experimentation and the Overall Evaluation Criterion: How to derive metrics you can measure in an experiment from the organisational metrics above.</li>
<li>Institutional Memory and Meta-Analysis</li>
<li>Ethics in Controlled Experiments</li>
<li>Complementary Techniques: Alternatives or complements to experimenting.</li>
<li>Observational Causal Studies: What to do when RCTs are impossible to carry out.</li>
<li>Client-Side Experiments: Should you run client-side or server-side experiments?</li>
<li>Instrumentation: Culture and practice.</li>
<li>Choosing a Randomization Unit</li>
<li>Ramping Experiment Exposure: Trading Off Speed, Quality, and Risk: Considerations when releasing your experiment.</li>
<li>Scaling Experiment Analyses: The less manual the better, generally.</li>
<li>The Statistics behind Online Controlled Experiments: T-tests et al.</li>
<li>Variance Estimation and Improved Sensitivity: Pitfalls and Solutions</li>
<li>The A/A Test: What is it? Why run it?</li>
<li>Triggering for Improved Sensitivity: When to trigger a participant into an experiment.</li>
<li>Sample Ratio Mismatch and Other Trust-Related Guardrail Metrics: Measures of how trustworthy your results are.</li>
<li>Leakage and Interference between Variants: Problems and solutions when test and control groups interfere with each other.</li>
<li>Measuring Long-Term Treatment Effects: When you want to measure results for much longer than the typical 1-2 week duration of an experiment - and when you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, highly recommended. I learned and formalised a decent amount even after being involved in this field for some time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/matlock-2024">Matlock</a>.</p>
<p>Not the original classic; this is a 2024 call-back to the show. Madeline Kingston, a previously retired lawyer, applies to work in a law firm she suspects of covering up a report about opioids that could have saved her daughter&rsquo;s life. Each episode tends to cover an unrelated court case where Madeline - under the fake name Maddy Matlock, extoling a fake life - helps her colleagues save an innocent defendant.</p>
<p>To do this she usually leverages the prejudice against folksy older women that they&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08952841.2023.2197658#abstract">basically invisible</a> to those around them too harmless or <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/03/cover-new-concept-of-aging">cognitively impaired</a> to possibly present any kind of threat to people they interact with in order to charm those involved in the prosecution of the case into providing the key facts or information that lead to the acquittal of the client concerned.</p>
<p>In between court room appearances she sneaks around undercover looking for the evidence she needs to prove the prior malign actions of the company with regards to her daughter&rsquo;s tragic demise - did they do it, who was involved and why?</p>
<p>This side of the show is, to me at least, extremely obviously based on the real-life appalling events surrounding the Sackler family&rsquo;s promotion of OxyContin - building an &ldquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">empire of pain</a>&rdquo; - even if no direct reference is ever made to it.</p>

I&rsquo;m wasn&rsquo;t tempted to skip any tracks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_DiRusso">She&rsquo;s an indie-rock musician</a> , although this album crosses genres at time, with some songs being more poppy, others more punky - and often full of compelling and relatable self-introspection</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/severance/seasons/2">Severance season 2</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back with our intrepid macro-data-refining team of four who, after one of the most dramatic cliff-hangers I recall from 3 years ago (perhaps the only one I remember from so long ago), continue their attempts to figure out what is going on with their employer, Lumon, why they&rsquo;re doing what they do, along with the dark secrets it holds. Plus how to live an acceptable split life.</p>
<p>This is, by a decent margin, my favourite show that I can remember from recent years, perhaps ever.</p>
<p>The premise is that they work on the severed floor, having willingly undergone the process of severance. This entails an operation that results the development of an innie - the person you are at work, and an outie - the person you are elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whilst sharing the same body and brain, the innie has no memory of what the outie is doing and vice versa. From their point of view, the outie lives their live, turns up to work, and immediately leaves again. Time has passed but they have no memory of what happened. Conversely, the innie is always at work. They leave the office and are then right back there, with no concept of what happened in between.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a process billed to give you a break from your worst, most traumatic memories, as well as promote a healthy work-life balance - at least for the outie, who never remembers working a day in their life.</p>
<p>This results in something like a dramatic interpretation of a philosophical thought experiment involving the self - what does it mean to be you? - as well notions of consent and so on. It&rsquo;s not a totally unrealistic possibility; witness for instance the IRL existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain">split brain patients</a> who, following a brain operation, can appear to develop two separate selves - each unaware of the other&rsquo;s thoughts, each with their own awareness, preferences and personality.</p>
<p>Back in the Severance world, this is beautifully topped off with what could be seen as a critique of the the modern workplace, of office life, of the ridiculousness of corporate culture, of what we do to ourselves in the name of earning money - and what we let companies get away with in an era of pretty much unconstrained capitalism.</p>
<p>The show exquisitely done, hilarious at times, scary and tension-filled at others, mysterious and compelling with fantastic characters throughout. The visuals are incredible, the sound fantastic. It&rsquo;s rightly won all sorts of awards.</p>
<p>I cannot wait for the next series. Please let the wait be less than between the first two.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/podcasts/serial-the-retrievals-yale-fertility-clinic.html">The Retrievals</a>.</p>
<p>This is a podcast from the famous about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/yale-fetility-clinic-lawsuit-fentanyl-theft-nurse-b7e9deb60a2de53fd329d87d5e0a8913">a horrific incident</a> in the history of the Yale Fertility Centre.</p>
<p>Women would visit the centre in order to participate in IVF treatment. Part of the process is <a href="https://www.fertility.com/en/resources/articles/egg-retrieval-explained.html">the egg retrieval</a>, where eggs are retrieved from the ovaries. This is an invasive procedure involving a needle being inserted into the ovary.</p>
<p>In isolation it&rsquo;s potentially extremely painful, so patients are sedated or given anaesthesia such that they don&rsquo;t suffer. Except at Yale, some were not. Instead of the intended fentanyl they were given vials of saline - salt water - which has no pain-prevention characteristics. Some thus went through an absolutely agonising, totally unnecessary, experience.</p>
<p>At this point it&rsquo;s no spoiler to say that the fundamental cause was that a nurse was stealing the fentanyl for herself and secretly replacing it with the saline. But of course there&rsquo;s a lot more to dive into in this story - the who, why and how did she get away with it for so long in such a renowned institution - alongside the important stories of the patients themselves.</p>

			 <p>Brace yourself for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html">the long list of words</a> that the New York Times found are flagged by the Trump administration to be banned or limited from usage within the government and all its outputs.</p>
<p>This list is from reporting over a month ago and even back then they claimed it was likely incomplete. At the time, the NYT had recorded over 250 web pages from federal agencies having been edited or deleted based on these words. I&rsquo;m sure the number has only risen since then.</p>
<p>And yes, this is from the same administration whose President started off by creating an executive order literally called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">RESTORING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ENDING FEDERAL CENSORSHIP</a>&rdquo; who has handed immeasurable unaccountable freedom and power to a guy who <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/29/elon-musks-free.html">once claimed</a> to be a free speech absolutist.

<p>Back on the tropical island that must have the highest murder rate around. Same setup as previously, only it seemed to me that basically the solution to every case involved realising that the act of murder actually happened a long time before it seemed to.</p>
<p>Grumpy new detective Mervin Wilson constantly pretends he wants to return home to his native England, but instead predictably stays around to help the rest of the local team solve, solve, solve.</p>
<p>Nothing new here; simply the gentle comfort of watching a season 14 of a show you watched the previous 13 seasons of. Only, oh no, can the eternal presence of Commissioner Selwyn Patterson really be at its end?</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/toxic-town">Toxic Town</a>.</p>
<p>This mini-series was also written by Jack Thorne, the same person who co-wrote another recent highly impactful show I watched, <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/03/30/watched-adolescence-this-part-drama.html">Adolescence</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the latter (despite what some largely offensive people <a href="https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/netflixs-adolescence-is-not-based-single-person-or-event-2025-04-17/">like to claim about Adolescence</a>), this series is based on a single, specific true event. One I hadn&rsquo;t heard of, to my shame.</p>
<p>In 1981, the owners of a steel-making industrial site <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corby_toxic_waste_case">in the UK town of Corby closed it down</a>. The relevant council decided to demolish and re-excavate the site as part of an urban regeneration program.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards pregnant people in the area started having babies that suffered from birth defects at a weirdly high level. Some had miscarriages.</p>
<p>Each in isolation has no way to know that this is anything more than a rare and potentially personally devastating outcome for them, their family and of course their child. But once they start to learn of each other&rsquo;s situations they come to the conclusion that something more than bad luck is going on in the area; eventually settling on the idea that what happened to them must relate to the mismanagement of the shutdown of the steel plant and the resulting very visible chemical contamination of the area.</p>
<p>They end up taking the council to court. The council fervently denies the allegations, disputes their evidence and tries to come up with some of their own. However, they do so dishonestly, prioritising blanket denial, and their own financial interests, over the suffering of the claimants. It&rsquo;s hard to say it&rsquo;s anything other than a deliberate cover-up, rife with corruption.</p>
<p>This dramatized documentary then tells the story of a few of the women involved, from the traumatic start of their plight through to their attempts to win some kind of legal justice for their children - no matter how hard the struggle became, no matter the toll the fight inevitably took on them and their families.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781471137341">Hidden Bodies</a> by Caroline Kepnes.</p>
<p>This is the second book in the &lsquo;You&rsquo; series, likewise inspiring <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/you/seasons/2">the second season</a> of the Netflix show.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s more of the same as <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/03/23/finished-reading-you-by-caroline.html">the first was</a> - a first person narrated tale of a guy falling into a wormhole of violent obsession with the next supposed love of his life and those around her.</p>
<p>It might be critiqued as being at least as unnecessarily gratuitous as the first, and I&rsquo;m not sure it does my brain all that much good to read it. But the first person narration of a clearly increasingly deranged person was as compulsive as the first to me. As one can see by how quick I got to it and through it.</p>
<p>Basically if you liked the first, you&rsquo;ll like this one too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know only too well how policies can be traduced and the markets weaponised against people who are trying to change things. The 2022 Mini-Budget was a sensible package of tax freezes, spending restraint and supply-side measures, including fracking, which would have generated economic growth (and was smaller in scale than fiscal announcements before or since).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A huge amount of hysteria was generated, making it very difficult to get messages across. Ultimately, Conservative-in-name-only MPs, the economic establishment and their allies in the media contributed to so much turbulence that the policies could not be implemented. I was blamed for failures that were actually the Bank of England’s: it has since admitted that two-thirds of the market movement was its responsibility.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Once again showing that the MAGA folk exhibit the exact same behaviours they falsely ascribe to their more liberal enemies but in the opposite direction, I see that the little boys have got all over-excited about &ldquo;pronouns&rdquo;. You know, words like &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;she&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And literally those ones, we&rsquo;re not even talking exclusively about ones that the average Trumpy sycophant may never have encountered before their last viewing of an overdramatic Fox News report.</p>
<p>Soon after the new administration clocked in, federal government workers were literally banned from mentioning their pronouns in email signature blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks ,” instructions to State Department employees read, in an email they received Friday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and they should be eradicated from official forms too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The instructions to medical staff at some Veterans Affairs facilities also articulated how references to gender would have to be excised on forms: “The use of GENDER is not allowed on any form. We can only use SEX, and there should be only 2 options — MALE and FEMALE.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently, it turned out that it&rsquo;s apparently not enough that the remaining government employees are to have their at-worst-harmless email signatures censored and silenced. Non-government journalists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/business/media/white-house-journalists-pronouns.html?">aren&rsquo;t supposed to use them</a> either. Well, not if they want the White House to respond to their questions anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters’ questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? As if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious. But it&rsquo;s sometimes hilarious to hear what exactly they think they&rsquo;re scared of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,” Ms. Leavitt, the press secretary, wrote in an email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thought of sitting down at my professional job and writing a sentence like that just blows my mind. Of course the same could be said for a lot of official communiques these days.</p>
<p>Steven Cheung, the White House communications director had the following to say, apparently with no irony whatsoever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If The New York Times spent the same amount of time actually reporting the truth as they do being obsessed with pronouns, maybe they would be a half-decent publication.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">The Atlantic recently revealed</a> one of the more unbelievable examples of the rabid and revealing incompetence of the current high-ups in the US administration.</p>
<p>It turns out at least some of the VIPs use somewhat-but-should-be-more popular messaging app <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> to plot their military strikes. As well as chat about how much they hate Europe and share impossibly cringe-inducing streams of emojis.</p>
<p>How do we know this? Trump&rsquo;s National Security Advisor Michael Waltz accidently invited one of the world&rsquo;s more famous journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic</a>, into a Signal chat group called &ldquo;Houthi PC small group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PC probably means Principals Committee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon afterwards, a bunch of the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells that are busy diminishing the stature of America overnight joined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One minute later, a person identified only as “MAR”—the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio—wrote, “Mike Needham for State,” apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as “JD Vance” wrote, “Andy baker for VP.” One minute after that, “TG” (presumably Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, “Joe Kent for DNI.” Nine minutes later, “Scott B”—apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, “Dan Katz for Treasury.” At 4:53 p.m., a user called “Pete Hegseth” wrote, “Dan Caldwell for DoD.” And at 6:34 p.m., “Brian” wrote “Brian McCormack for NSC.” One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.</p>
<p>The principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as “S M,” which I took to stand for Stephen Miller. I appeared on my own screen only as “JG.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They then went on to discuss their top secret plans to attack the Houthis alongside their strong loathing of Europe. Oh, and the fact that JD Vance probably doesn&rsquo;t agree with Trump quite as much as he pretends to.</p>
<p>Goldberg understandably started off rather sceptical that the group was real rather than some weird AI prank or whatever.  I mean, it does feel way too good to be true. But when he saw the military plans that were discussed actually taking place in the real world, there was no more doubting it.</p>
<p>The participants subsequently of course denied everything, except (somewhat to my surprise) that the message chain was real. Denying things that there is incontrovertible evidence for is of course no obstacle to the current administration.</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody was texting war plans. And that’s all I have to say about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No locations. No sources &amp; methods. NO WAR PLANS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Waltz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 11:44 a.m. eastern time, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, “TEAM UPDATE:”</p>
<p>The text beneath this began, “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.” Centcom, or Central Command, is the military’s combatant command for the Middle East. The Hegseth text continues:
“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)”
“1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goldberg <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/">somewhat reluctantly reprints</a>, proving the lie - whilst remaining very conscious of the potential national security issues inherent if he was to reveal some even more damaging content. But as they say even about the released bits and pieces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s get back to the ludicrous response to this potentially catastrophic breech from Trump&rsquo;s people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t classified information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says Donald Trump.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>says John Ratcliffe, director of the CIA.</p>
<p>OK then, so I suppose they&rsquo;d be OK with the Atlantic publishing the full exchange? Maybe Goldberg was playing it a bit over-cautious and this was nothing more than a public discussion they meant to humiliate themselves by typing into Twitter but accidentally hit the wrong app&rsquo;s icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/">Apparently not.</a></p>
<p>Per the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>yes, we object to the release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original reporting of the incident Goldberg <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">deliberately held back</a> a lot of information he felt would be too classified to be responsibly reported on. Including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One more person responded: “John Ratcliffe” wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goldberg wrote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified</p>
</blockquote>
<p>agreed  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/watch-live-intelligence-hearing-signal-fallout-continues-2025-03-26/">Republican Senator Wicker</a>.</p>
<p>The in-chat hilarity / horror continued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are currently clean on OPSEC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>writes Hegseth. Au contraire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans</p>
</blockquote>
<p>headlines famed reporter of one of the most famous publications in America.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was intended to be a an [sic] internal and private deliberation amongst high-level senior staff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said the White House Press Secretary. Deliberation hey? Well, it must have been Very Serious and Important I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>👊🇺🇸🔥</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote Waltz, in said &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo;- a triptych of emojis that is surely now destined for the annals of memeolgy / my email signature.</p>
<p>Witkoff continued the thoughtful foreign policy discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🙏🙏💪🇺🇸🇺🇸</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and the usual suspects got all hot and bothered by Europe again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just hate bailing Europe out again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sighed JD Vance, supposedly confidentially.</p>
<p>Hegseth continued the bantz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>So why <em>was</em> Goldberg invited to this top secret chat? It turns out that it was probably neither a deliberate act of government transparency or particularly incompetent example of double-agenting by one of the MAGA faithful.</p>
<p>Rather it seems like Waltz <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/signal-group-chat-leak-how-it-happened">saved Goldberg&rsquo;s contact details to the wrong contact</a> in his iPhone. He overwrote Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes' number with Goldberg&rsquo;s. So when he tried to invite Hughes he accidentally invited Goldberg.</p>
<p>Waltz still isn&rsquo;t taking much responsibility of course:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He also suggested on Fox News that Goldberg’s number had been “sucked” into his phone, seemingly in reference to how his iPhone had saved Goldberg’s number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, magically &ldquo;sucked&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure. That said, it might be one example where - if the claim that it was prompted by an iPhone autosuggestion is vaguely true - Apple&rsquo;s AI mishaps ended up being a force for good. Well, a certain type of good.</p>

We <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/journalist-trump-yemen-war-chat">started off with</a> &ldquo;I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic&rdquo;, followed up by a chaser of &ldquo;The interest in the massive breach of national security is nothing more than a &ldquo;witch hunt&rdquo;. And the Signal app itself &ldquo;could be defective&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Signal is of course not defective. It&rsquo;s constantly recommended by the folk that know these things as being a super secure way of communicating. It is a great option for messaging privately and securely; in fact my favourite. But no technology can be all that secure when you explicitly invite internationally famous journalists who have not joined the cult of adoring you, and hence you regard as your mortal enemies, to your chat.</p>
<p>Other interesting bits and pieces include:</p>
<p>At least some of these folk would seem to be using their personal phones rather than any secured government equipment, or at least that&rsquo;s what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/trump-signal-leak-new-messages">Special Envoy Witkoff&rsquo;s comment</a> reads like to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government” but then explained that the reason he did not make any comments in the chat until after returning to the US was “because I had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But her emails, etc. etc.</p>
<p>And also the nature of this chat group might not be meeting the legal obligations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/trump-signal-leak-new-messages">regarding retention</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The messages in the Signal chat were set to be automatically deleted in under four weeks. The Federal Records Act typically mandates that government communication records are kept for two years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780063438354">Hillbilly Elegy</a> by J D Vance.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the famous autobiography of the current US vice-president, JD Vance. It is difficult, probably impossible, for me to read it outside of the context of the obsequious horrors he has gone on to do or support since. Nonetheless, I felt compelled to see if his book would help me understand what made him into the person that he became today.</p>
<p>At the time of its release the book generated some favourable commentary about its realistic portrayal of the oft-overlooked White working-class life in some quarters. Other people believed it did little else but engage in poverty-porn and reinforce negative stereotypes.</p>
<p>A good fraction of the book is the experiences of his child and young adult-hood. He does appear to have grown up in very economically and socially challenging circumstances. His parents did not provide him with anything remotely approaching the childhood we should want for all of our youngsters. Instead: desertion, drugs, threats, violence. A fairly largely proportion anyone&rsquo;s list of potential adverse childhood experiences are on show here.</p>
<p>He was largely saved by his grandparents. They had their own struggles but, particularly his grandmother, became a positive role model in his life. He ended up doing very well at school. He later joined the Marines which he attributes with giving him a sense of discipline and responsibility. Next up he goes to Ohio State University and then to one of the pinnacles of American educational privilege - Yale Law School.</p>
<p>So, a classic rags-to-riches story.</p>
<p>That he expects everyone else to be able to replicate perfectly.</p>
<p>Yes, in between the slightly horrifying anecdotes we have constant infusions of &ldquo;poor people are all lazy&rdquo; and &ldquo;underprivileged people should just have tried harder&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the classic right-wing view, often to be found from those who did somehow make it from a deprived background into the bastions of elite privilege. I get the intuition, especially if you believe you did it yourself. The only problem is that that belief is basically never true.</p>
<p>Nonetheless if we discount the repeated humble-bragging, it&rsquo;s clear to see he believes that he has power and status entirely basically because he&hellip;um&hellip;tried hard. So the only reason that every American doesn&rsquo;t go to Yale Law is because they didn&rsquo;t try as hard as him and, what&rsquo;s more, they should have.</p>
<p>At times he comes so close to drawing what I see as the correct conclusions from his life experience that it&rsquo;s painful to watch him retreat back into his tedious and predicatable rhetoric. I mean, part of the reason he was able to go to Yale Law was because of the Veterans Affairs  <a href="https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/">&ldquo;Yellow Ribbon&rdquo; program</a> whereby the state funded half his tuition. And Yale Law funded the other half due to his poverty-stricken background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, if it was not for the Yellow Ribbon Program I would not be going to law school.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/feb/19/ask-politifact-did-jd-vance-benefit-from-dei-initi/">he said</a>, before leaving that fact out of his autobiography.</p>
<p>But the Yale Law funding side of things did make it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet the financial aid package Yale offered exceeded my wildest dreams&hellip;</p>
<p>In my first year, it was nearly a full ride. That wasn’t because of anything I’d done or earned — it was because I was one of the poorest kids in school. Yale offered tens of thousands (of dollars) in need-based aid. It was the first time being so broke paid so well.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need based aid! Wow! Such DEI! So much affirmative action. Its a version of the same policies that are now pure anathema to him and the administration he&rsquo;s part of.</p>
<p>I mean this days, his past actions would presumably have got him fired based on what <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/feb/19/ask-politifact-did-jd-vance-benefit-from-dei-initi/">Politifact&rsquo;s interviewee reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burke told PolitiFact that Vance served on the Yale Veterans Association, which Burke called &ldquo;an affinity group that is considered a DEI group&rdquo; and said it &ldquo;was doing DEI work to increase veteran enrollment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later he makes a big show and dance of the time when his grandma&rsquo;s medical bills went up to the point that she couldn&rsquo;t afford them. That&rsquo;s a traumatic, potentially damaging or deadly, time for anyone so afflicted to be sure. All to common a US experience from what I understand. My genuine deepest sympathies to you all.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion he reaches from that is not, as you might expect from the rest of his book, that his grandmother didn&rsquo;t try hard enough - that she deserved to die an agonising death because she is too poor to afford medical care. That she brought it on herself by not managing to get into Yale Law.</p>
<p>Instead, like a hero, having recently received his first big lawyer&rsquo;s check, he swoops in to fund it for her, immensely proud that he could do so. Presumably blind-sided by his own glowing magnificence enough not to have noticed the rank hypocrisy of providing financial medical aid to his grandmother whilst despising the very existence of state programs like Medicaid that provide assistance to <em>other</em> people&rsquo;s grandmothers. The grandmothers who don&rsquo;t have sons lucky enough to have affirmative-actioned themself into the Ivy League.</p>
<p>The book cuts off well before his &ldquo;<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/15/jd-vance-donald-trump-comments-00168450">Trump is Hitler</a>&rdquo; phase let alone his &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o">Trump is the Greatest</a>&rdquo; phase. But we all know what happened next.</p>

			 <p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781668023488">Abundance</a> by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.</p>

<p>&hellip;a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to renew a politics of plenty, face up to the failures of liberal governance, and abandon the chosen scarcities that have deformed American life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a thought circulating in the morass of my brain for a long while that so much of the scarcity we feel, especially that surrounding the basics of what is needed to live a subjectively good and effective life, is avoidable.</p>
<p>We could have &lsquo;enough&rsquo;. Rather, our struggles are a product of our societal structures, or sometimes even a deliberate policy, usually designed to further the ends of others.</p>
<p>Hopefully this book will help sense-check and formalise my currently fairly vibe based take on the subject.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/04/05/how-to-download-and-remove.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-05 08:29:18 &#43;0100">Apr 5, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In their great unwisdom, Amazon recently decided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">to remove the feature</a> that allowed you to download the Kindle books you&rsquo;d purchased from them via the web. You could then remove the DRM from the downloaded books so that you could use them on non-Kindle devices or back them up in case Amazon ever decided to <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-is-not-to-be-trusted-anymore-with-their-kindle-e-reader">permanently remove them from your Kindle</a> or you lose your Amazon account. <em>Obviously</em> you should only have done this if DRM removal Is legal in your jurisdiction of course. Hmm.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are still (much less convenient) ways to download your books if you have either an older Kindle - although I hear if your Kindle is the black-and-white type then your covers and images. might all come out as monochrome as they are on your Kindle if you go this way - or access to a Windows computer, which preserves the colour. But the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html">previous method</a> I used to to remove the DRM doesn&rsquo;t work any more.</p>
<p>However the file-liberating geniuses out there have figured that you can still remove the DRM, freeing your purchased files,  if you try a slightly different method that involves an old version of the Windows Kindle software, Calibre and an extra plugin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a description of how to go about it.</p>
<p>Install <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>, along with the following two plugins.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/releases/tag/v10.0.9">DeDRM plugin</a> - current version is 10.0.9. Installation instructions in <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html">my previous post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://plugins.calibre-ebook.com/">KFX Input plugin</a> - current version is 2.22.0. You can install this from inside Calibre by going to Preferences -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Get new plugins -&gt; Search for KFX -&gt; Select to install &ldquo;KFX Input&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Download Kindle for PC - but the trick here is it must be version 2.4.0 (70904).  A current link to the right version is <a href="https://kindleforpc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/70904/KindleForPC-installer-2.4.70904.exe">this</a>. Newer versions won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Download the batch file disable_k4pc_download.bat <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=210021&amp;d=1723090343">from here</a> - discussion about that starts <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4444671#post4444671">here</a>. It will create a file so as to prevent Kindle for PC auto updating. May or may not be strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Install the above Kindle for PC version as per usual. I turned off internet connectivity whilst doing this although that might not be essential, I&rsquo;m not sure. The main point is that don&rsquo;t want to give the software a chance to update itself to a new version from which you won&rsquo;t be able to remove the DRM from your books. As soon as it was installed I went to Tools -&gt; Options and turned off &ldquo;Automatically install updates when they are available without asking me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then run the file disable_k4pc_download.bat.</p>
<p>Turn internet back on and sign into Kindle for PC with your Amazon account as usual.</p>
<p>You can then right-click and download any book. They will download to somewhere on your disk; by default your Documents folder in a subfolder called My Kindle Content. You should then be able to add them to Calibre as normal (the Add Book option) and DRM will be stripped. At least for most books; apparently some special ones remain impervious to this.</p>
<p>The main issue I have with the above is that Kindle for PC doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to find or open any books shared with you via the Amazon Household feature. I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s any way around this at present other than logging in as the person who shared them with you.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/adolescence">Adolescence</a>.</p>
<p>This 4-part drama is somewhat sweeping the world by storm, at least the small part of the world I inhabit. It&rsquo;s a very moving, powerful and relevant series that follows what happened after a (fictional) 13 year old boy is accused of committing murder.</p>
<p>The acting is quite incredible, especially considering that this is the actor portraying the boy concerned, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Cooper_(actor)">Owen Cooper&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/tvfilm/boy-adolescence-owen-cooper-b1217411.html">first acting role</a>. That is so astonishing I almost can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Each episode has been shot in real-time, all essentially done in the same shot. We see what happens to the characters in real-time, learn what they learn, perhaps feel something of what they would feel. This means that the episodes tend to be situated in a single area; in one case almost a single room. This takes nothing away from their gripping, compulsive nature.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the knowledge to confirm, but it comes across as a pretty realistic depiction of the real-life processes that would be involved. And, harrowingly, importantly, a commentary on some of the aspects of modern society - especially contemporary online culture - that can lead to the type of tragic events concerned that we should all take something away from.</p>

			 <p>Previously-popular DNA analysing company <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q4r9xy9wro">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>On the basis that no-one really knows what&rsquo;s going to happen to it next, various organisations - including <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers">California&rsquo;s Attorney General</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/23andme-data-bankrupt/">NYT&rsquo;s Wirecutter</a> - are advising that customers should probably download and delete their (very sensitive) data. It&rsquo;s a shame given the potential for good such a collection had, but totally makes sense to do given today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers">the aforementioned AG&rsquo;s site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>To Delete Genetic Data from 23andMe:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Consumers can delete their account and personal information by taking the following steps:</li>
<li>Log into your 23andMe account on their website. </li>
<li>Go to the “Settings” section of your profile.</li>
<li>Scroll to a section labeled “23andMe Data” at the bottom of the page. </li>
<li>Click “View” next to “23andMe Data”</li>
<li>Download your data: If you want a copy of your genetic data for personal storage, choose the option to download it to your device before proceeding.</li>
<li>Scroll to the “Delete Data” section. </li>
<li>Click “Permanently Delete Data.” </li>
<li>Confirm your request: You’ll receive an email from 23andMe; follow the link in the email to confirm your deletion request.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To Destroy Your 23andMe Test Sample:</strong></p>
<p>If you previously opted to have your saliva sample and DNA stored by 23andMe, but want to change that preference, you can do so from your account settings page, under “Preferences.”</p>
<p><strong>To Revoke Permission for Your Genetic Data to be Used for Research:</strong></p>
<p>If you previously consented to 23andMe and third-party researchers to use your genetic data and sample for research, you may withdraw consent from the account settings page, under “Research and Product Consents.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it quite disgraceful that 23andme hasn&rsquo;t reached out to its customers about this at all as far as I can tell. Indeed they&rsquo;re still selling their service, currently promoting the always-weird-to-me Mother&rsquo;s day sale in case you want to expose your mum to the risk. Outside of the bankruptcy, I can&rsquo;t imagine why it would ever be a good idea to buy a relative a 23andme kit, unless of course they specifically asked you.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781643586595">You</a> by Caroline Kepnes.</p>
<p>This is the book behind the TV show &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/you">You</a>&rdquo;. And, at least from my slightly distant memory of the show, it&rsquo;s pretty much the same story presented in the same style in a different format. So here again, our protagonist narrates his thoughts and dreams as he instantly falls in love with, and becomes ever more dangerously obsessed by, a young lady who visits his bookstore.</p>
<p>Where it goes is not exactly unpredictable. Not much of a spoiler to say that the story contains sex and violence, perhaps a little more graphically than necessary. Shades of the classic <a href="https://bookriot.com/resisting-the-dead-girl-trope/">&ldquo;women as perpetual victims&rdquo; genre</a> and a couple of other tropes are on display. But, to be fair, the girl in question here is integral to and features throughout, the story, and the first / second person narrative style that made it so compelling to me probably makes this unavoidable. It&rsquo;s not like the guy doing the talking is presented as either a reliable narrator, let alone a sympathetic character.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of thriller that&rsquo;s all the more chilling for being somewhat plausible. If nothing else, the story might encourage folk to lock down their Facebook a bit.</p>

			 <p>As regular as these shocks to the system have become, one or two still catch me by surprise.</p>
<p>I did not see the whole &ldquo;King Charles is <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-commonwealth-offer-us-member-b2719470.html">going to offer membership</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations">British Commonwealth</a>&rdquo; to Trump. Nor, given his infamous <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-executive-action-world-health-organization-withdrawal/index.html">distaste</a> for most useful global <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/trump-may-withdraw-us-from-nato-bolton-warns/">organisations</a>, would I have expected Trump to want it. It turned out <a href="https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1903090488036487326">he probably does</a>.</p>
<p>My best guess is he got confused and thinks that this will make him King of the UK, Canada et al. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine this is something the American public or their founding fathers would have been great fans of given, you know, the vibes of the <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/Timeline-American-Revolution-War-Independence/">events of 1776</a> and the whole &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War">Revolutionary War</a>&rdquo; thing.</p>
<p>More predictably, given his deep infatuation-for-now with Elon Musk, he recently an extremely weird press conference about how great Teslas are and how he loves paying full price for them - during which is was revealed that not only can&rsquo;t he drive but as far as I can tell he has no concept of how to use a car in general. There goes Sleepy Donald, a less charitable person might say. Well, someone did the time <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/us/2028131/donald-trump-commit-disrespectful-act">he fell asleep during a National Prayer Service</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway this particular stunt entailed turning &ldquo;the White House lawn into a Tesla Showroom&rdquo; as NBC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/trump-musk-tesla-white-house-showroom-buys-car-rcna195905">correctly reports</a>. Imagine the QVC shopping channel, but it&rsquo;s the US president.</p>
<p>Senator Chris Murphy&rsquo;s <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1899557531476713625">very appropriate response</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because the corruption plays out in public doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not corruption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should that not be enough possibly illegal and definitely immoral boosterism for his pal, Trump&rsquo;s Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced that from hereon in anyone who &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; Tesla property - and there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Takedown">plenty of protests</a> that might by some definitions be categorised in ways adjacent to that - is now to be classified as, wait for it, a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-bondi-statement-violent-attacks-against-tesla-property">domestic terrorist</a>.</p>
<p>I of course have no idea if such events would technically fall under that classification or not - but even if so, note not &ldquo;car lots in general&rdquo; or &ldquo;any defacement&rdquo;, but rather attacks &ldquo;on Tesla property&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/03/20/are-tesla-attacks-considered-domestic-terrorism/">at least 3 people</a> are being charged as such, which would result in prison sentences between 5 and 20 years. In these cases it sounds like they were going rather above and beyond the typical protestor - Molotov cocktails were involved - but if this works out for the Trumpistas it feels likely the reach might expand a little further.</p>
<p>In any case, the whole merely-domestic-terrorism thing isn&rsquo;t nearly extreme enough for Trump&rsquo;s protectionism towards his new favourite brand of the very products <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-buying-tesla-harsh-things-evs-years-119680885">he himself hated</a> approximately 5 minutes ago. Let&rsquo;s never forget him lumping electric cars in with his shopping list of things he wished would &ldquo;ROT IN HELL&rdquo; <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/111642745146668045">at the end of 2023</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Included also are World Leaders, both good and bad, but none of which are as evil and “sick” as the THUGS we have inside our Country who, with their Open Borders, INFLATION, Afghanistan Surrender, Green New Scam, High Taxes, No Energy Independence, Woke Military, Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Iran, All Electric Car Lunacy, and so much more, are looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, times change, and now he&rsquo;s started issuing not-so vague threats to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-suggests-tesla-vandals-prison-el-salvador/story?id=120019715">deport anyone who vandalises Teslas to El Salvador</a>, presumably under a similar law he abused to unconstitutionally <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/03/18/more-illegal-and-unconstitutional-behaviour.html">send suspected Venezuelan gang members to a foreign jail</a> without any known evidence or due process.</p>
<p>In 2025 <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114200244380161257">besotted-Trump speak</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s explicit view is that the current vandalisation of Teslas is in fact <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-suggests-tesla-vandals-prison-el-salvador/story?id=120019715">worse than what happened during</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">January 6th insurrection</a>. The insurrection. Where <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/how-many-died-as-a-result-of-capitol-riot/">people died</a>.</p>
<p>What else? Well, there&rsquo;s the French scientist <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20250320-french-scientist-denied-us-entry-over-text-messages-criticising-trump">who was turned away from entering the US to attend a scientific conference</a> seemingly because when the immigration officers went through his phone and laptop they saw text messages that were critical of Trump. He was <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/scientist-denied-entry-to-us-after-messages-critical-of-trump-found-on-his-phone-13332518">surprise-detained in the US for a day</a> and then sent packing back to France, minus his work laptop and mobile phone</p>
<p>Said the French minister of Higher Education and Research, Philippe Baptiste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher’s phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy,” the minister said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US authorities reportedly said the messages &ldquo;could be qualified as terrorism&rdquo;. As far as I know we don&rsquo;t know what the messages actually said, but unless there was a detailed plan of action regarding another assassination attempt, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to believe that is likely to be true by any reasonable standards. The FBI declined to press charges after all.</p>
<p>The French foreign ministry obviously can&rsquo;t do anything about the refusal of entry but said that it &ldquo;deplored the situation&rdquo;. France is now going out of its way to welcome with open arms  US scientists who understandably feel the need to leave their home country in order to continue their important work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A day after the French researcher was reportedly expelled from the United States, Baptiste posted a photograph on X, showing a virtual meeting with an American researcher who, along with “several dozens” of others, had decided to take the university up on its offer.</p>
<p>“We need to continue to propose new solutions to welcome the researchers who need or want to leave the United States in the near future,” the minister wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Research is being chain-sawed in the United States!” said Baptiste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally for now, there was the attempt by Minnesota senators to classify &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome#cite_note-:3-14">Trump Derangement Syndrome</a>&rdquo;, a phrase previously used simply as an insult against anyone who someone decides is over-reacting negatively to Trump&rsquo;s terrible words and deeds, <a href="https://eu.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2025/03/20/trump-derangement-syndrome-minnesota-bill-mental-illness-violence/82566464007/">as a mental illness</a>.</p>
<p>Let the text of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF2589&amp;version=0&amp;session_year=2025&amp;session_number=0">Bill SF 2589</a> speak for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bill for an act relating to mental health; modifying the definition of mental illness; adding a definition for Trump Derangement Syndrome</p>
<p>Subd. 28. Trump Derangement Syndrome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trump Derangement Syndrome&rdquo; means the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump. Symptoms may include Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald J. Trump&rsquo;s behavior. This may be expressed by:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) verbal expressions of intense hostility toward President Donald J. Trump; and</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(2) overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting President Donald
J. Trump or anything that symbolizes President Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p>So there we go, it seems if you speak badly of Donald Trump you&rsquo;re either mentally ill or a terrorist who needs locking up in whichever <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/03/18/us-deports-hundreds-of-venezuelans.html">random country will take American money</a> to do so. Take your pick.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1772744880">Critical Thinking</a> by Manic Street Preachers.</p>
<p>This is the band&rsquo;s 15th album over the astonishing period of 33 years. They&rsquo;re still going strong, and still very political. Much of it comes across as a thoughtful critique of the experience of modern life, and a mix of a call to resist it, albeit with a certain amount of resignation that it is what it is.</p>
<p>Perhaps they&rsquo;re also getting a bit existentially old and tired. But their music isn&rsquo;t. I hope they keep on going, and if it in any way inspires a new generation to resist the less desirable aspects of modern life, so much the better.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1739079974">Brat</a> by Charli XCX.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone will have heard this album. It was an absolute sensation last year, and created a whole swathe of &ldquo;Brat whatever&rdquo; memology. It was of course the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-brat-summer-the-viral-meme-inspired-by-the-new-charli-xcx-album-explained">Brat summer</a>. Even Kamala Harris' doomed campaign (remember when we had hope?) <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/30/politics/american-battleground-kamala-harris-brat-summer/index.html">surfed the wave</a>.</p>
<p>On my first listen it didn&rsquo;t really impress me. But as the week went on I found myself bits and pieces of its songs re-entering into my mind, unsolicited. So I gave it another go, and another, and another, so I guess I&rsquo;m well and truly sucked in.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not alone - it&rsquo;s currently sitting at a &ldquo;Universal acclaim&rdquo; score of 95 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/music/brat/charli-xcx">on Metacritic</a>. As well as the catchy pop hooks, I think it has a depth that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious on a first background listen.</p>

<p>Part of my probably vain attempt to understand the grand history of what led us to the catastrophic place we&rsquo;re in today. Everything from the creation of the state known as Rus over a thousand years ago, through the era of the Tsars, the revolution, ending with the rise of Putin.</p>
<p>The documentary aired in 2021 so obviously there is some important future-history that we&rsquo;ll need a new documentary about after the next thousand years.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The dark timeline continues forthwith as the Trump administration<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9yv1gnzyvo"> explicitly defies</a> the order of a judge, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/us/politics/trump-venezuelans-deportations-el-salvador.html">whilst claiming</a> that they&rsquo;re doing no such thing for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">reasons including</a> &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t count because the judge spoke his decision instead of writing it down&rdquo;.
.
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9yv1gnzyvo">The story here</a> is that the US deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador without any signs of due process having taken place, no chance to have their cases heard, to appeal the claims that they are violent criminals. Some <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">reportedly claim</a> that they are in fact not event part of the gang that is the supposed motivation for their removal.</p>
<p>We seem to have no sense of what evidence, if any, there is for this. To legally justify this they <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798</a> , a law which is typically intended for and only used during times of war. It was last used in World War 2.</p>
<p>In any case, they were bundled onto a plane. Judge Boasberg found that this is potentially illegal and order the plane to turn back. The Trump administration didn&rsquo;t like this and simply ignored the order. The folk concerned are now in El Savador&rsquo;s &ldquo;notorious mega-jail Cecot&rdquo; after have being paraded around for the cameras.</p>
<p>Why El Salvador as opposed to, for instance, at least Venezulea? Well, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pay-el-salvador-jail-300-alleged-gang-members-ap-reports-2025-03-15/">US has decided to pay El Salvador</a> $6 million to imprison 300 of these people for at least a year. Strong vibes of the disgraceful British Rwanda plan here. Except that the US actually did it, seemingly in contravention of their own law.</p>
<p>I previously knew nothing about El Salvador&rsquo;s President Bukele, but it seems he&rsquo;s a wannabe Trumpster/Muskian, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">having tweeted &ldquo;Oopsie&hellip; Too late&rdquo;</a> plus a laughing emoji in reaction to the US executive defying the judiciary. The post was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">proudly shared</a> by the White House&rsquo;s director of communications,</p>
<p>We await what comes next - and what will happen to the role of the judiciary under this scary new regime. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wpek7p0kno">The BBC summarises</a> what was supposed to happen, but didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This incident has ignited fears that the White House is willing to openly defy a federal court order, setting it on a potential collision course with America&rsquo;s judicial branch.</p>
<p>In America&rsquo;s system of government checks and balances, federal courts in the judicial branch have the responsibility of reviewing actions by the president and the government agencies in the executive branch tasked with enacting laws passed by Congress. An order issued by a judge is binding - and noncompliance can result in civil and criminal sanctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving now to a totally different realm - but still potentially involving actions equally as illegal and contrary to the US constitution -Trump, via the usual weird ransom-note panic-post on his terrible social network, says he&rsquo;s going to undo <a href="https://time.com/7268902/trump-void-bidens-pardon-autopen/">the presidential pardons</a> that previous <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/01/20/from-reuters-us-president-joe.html">President Biden granted</a>.</p>
<p>The claim here is that they were signed via a computerised pen - where &ldquo;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-biden-autopen-signature-pardons-b2716533.html">the individual&rsquo;s signature is digitally recorded and stored</a> and a robotic arm holding a pen or pencil creates a near-exact replica of the signature on paper&rdquo;  - rather than an actual pen, and that Biden didn&rsquo;t know anything about them. The latter is ludicrous, the former is irrelevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;according to the U.S. Constitution, the President has no such authority to overturn his predecessor’s pardons, especially not based on the type of signature, legal experts say. “The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t even require that the pardon be written, so the idea that the signature is by autopen rather than by handwritten signature seems not relevant to the constitutionality because Article II just says that the President has the power to pardon,” says Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor and constitutional law expert.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The method of signing - autopen - has been used by other US presidents <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-pardons-void-autopen/">since the days of Truman</a>. The Justice Department, under President George W Bush, has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-pardons-void-autopen/">previously explicitly found</a> this to be absolutely fine.</p>

			 <p>Of course it would be ridiculous to compare the UK&rsquo;s current administration with the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/02/22/the-first-few-weeks-of.html">appalling ventures</a> conducted by that currently lording over our poor American friends, but I&rsquo;m not loving any moments where similarities feel evident.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781838439057">The Great Post Office Scandal</a> by Nick Wallis.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the millions of people who previous watched the famous documentary &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office">Mr Bates vs The Post Office</a>&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll know this story. I covered it <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/13/mr-bates-vs.html">here</a> so won&rsquo;t go into detail. But in summary, the Post Office introduced a new computer system to their post offices that had bugs resulting in it showing perceived discrepancies between the amount of stock and money a post office should in theory have in hand vs how much it actually did.</p>
<p>Some of these discrepancies constituted huge losses which, despite the protestations of their workers, some of whom had diligently called the IT helpline hundreds of times to report the system error, the Post Office typically assumed was the result of theft by the staff who worked there rather than take the time to actually investigate what had happened - or even let the accused investigate properly.</p>
<p>Said staff were thus prosecuted. Some were thrown into jail. The people concerned lost their business, their livelihood, sometimes their family, their mental and physical health or even, in the most extreme cases, their lives when they simply couldn&rsquo;t cope with the shame, destitution and other consequences that such unfair prosecutions brought upon them.</p>
<p>It of course turned out that the computer system did have bugs, several of which the Post Office high-ups explicitly knew about. They deliberately covered it up, lying to the people accused and the courts that they were prosecuted in. And this, after several years of becoming an ever larger travesty of justice, was finally proved via the extremely hard work of the people accused along with a few allies, turning these events into possibly one of the biggest scandals in the UK&rsquo;s recent history.</p>
<p>Nick Wallis, the author of this book, was one of the few journalists who&rsquo;d taken an interest in this story several years before it came to a head. This book - subtitled &ldquo;The fight to expose a multimillion pound IT disaster which put innocent people in jail&rdquo; - presents an extremely detailed retelling of the story and the campaign to do what was possible to give at least some justice to the people that suffered from the Post Office&rsquo;s incompetence and deception. Over 500 pages long, so perhaps only for the fairly committed - but these people undoubtedly deserve to heard their stories told in full.</p>

			 <p>Here, for disgusting posterity, is the infamous video of Vance and Trump behaving once again like petulant babies by publicly accusing Zelenskyy of being &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo;, amongst other things.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript">the transcript</a>, for the wise amongst us who don&rsquo;t want the visual image scarring our memories for the rest of time. It was shocking to watch.</p>
<p>Especially Vance&rsquo;s &ldquo;contribution&rdquo; almost feels like some kind of sick pre-planned skit from Vance. Which is not out of the question to me given I think I read somewhere (full disclosure: I can&rsquo;t find it, so I might be wrong) that apparently Trump and Vance workshopped that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/19/trump-attacks-zelenskyy-as-a-dictator-without-elections-who-duped-us-00204881">unimaginably dumb post</a> Trump made about how <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjev2j70v19o">Zelenskyy is a dictator</a> together (factcheck: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/19/europe/zelensky-trump-reaction-intl/index.html">he&rsquo;s not</a>).</p>
<p>But what else might we expect from an avaricious administration who blackmailed the beleaguered Ukraine with the threat of dropping their support of Ukraine&rsquo;s attempt to defend itself against the invasion if <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-demands-500b-in-rare-earths-from-ukraine-for-support/">they didn&rsquo;t hand over $500 billion of their natural resources</a> in return? Of the administration sending Keith Kellogg, the &ldquo;Special Ukraine Envoy&rdquo; to threaten to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-could-cut-ukraines-access-starlink-internet-services-over-minerals-say-2025-02-22/">turn off the communications satellites</a> that part of Ukraine&rsquo;s war effort depends on should they not cough up those billions of dollars? It&rsquo;s probably not an idle threat - Musk&rsquo;s company had already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-curbed-ukraines-use-starlink-internet-drones-company-president-2023-02-09/">artificially limited</a> how Ukraine could use them back in 2023.</p>
<p>Not that these satellites were being provided for free to be clear; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-is-paying-ukraines-starlink-subscription-its-deputy-pm-says-2025-02-22/">Poland is paying</a> the subscription for them - and so, extremely obvious ethics aside, their deactivation would be, if anything, a breach of a business contract with Poland.</p>
<p>Since their latest temper tantrum, the US administration <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/u-s-hitting-brakes-on-flow-of-arms-to-ukraine-980a71d1">has frozen all military aid to Ukraine</a>, jeopardising their ability to keep resisting Putin&rsquo;s invasion. They had already stopped financing weapons sales to Ukraine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Stopping military aid to Ukraine is incredibly damaging to the United States and a sad day for American interests because it rewards our adversaries,” said Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy at Razom for Ukraine. “I can hear the Champagne popping in Moscow, Beijing and Tehran.”</p>

<p>In fact it seems they want to return to funding the aggressor, Russia. The US is drawing up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/trump-sanctions-russia">a plan to ease the sanctions currently on Russia</a>. Some of these sanctions have been in place since Russia&rsquo;s annexation of Crimea back in 2014.</p>

			 <p>Flushed with the success of reading a <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/02/28/sobhanis-proof-of-spiritual-phenomena.html">whole one book</a> so far this year, and then having pummelled into a state of what feels like mindless ignorance by Recent World Events, it&rsquo;s time to add a stack more to my stupidly ambitious <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/books/books-i-want-to-read/">want-to-read list</a>.</p>
<p>Here we go, starting off with what I&rsquo;m going to call The Geopolitical Section; desperately in search of answers to what is the world like and why is it that way? And humbled by my increasing inability to answer some very basic questions about the organisation of the planet without looking it up.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780399562402">The World: A Brief Introduction</a> by Richard Haass.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780300263350">Not One Inch</a> by M. E. Sarotte - &ldquo;America, Russia, and the Making of Post-Cold War Stalemate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781615199518">The Shortest History of Israel and Palestine</a> by Michael Scott-Baumann - &ldquo;From Zionism to Intifadas and the Struggle for Peace&rdquo;</p>

Although a revised version is due to come out in May 2025, might be worth waiting for, all things considered.</p>
<p>Now into a section a less ecumenical version of myself might call &ldquo;know your enemies&rdquo;. Obviously, because I&rsquo;m such a saint, it&rsquo;s actually all about understanding the minds of those whom I otherwise cannot.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780300263084">A World after Liberalism</a> by Matthew Rose - &ldquo;Five thinkers who inspired the radical right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982181307">Elon Musk</a> by Walter Isaacson. Although not if he personally gets any money from it of course. And the biography might be due a hefty update soon I suppose.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9798217014323">Autocracy, Inc.</a> by Anne Applebaum - &ldquo;The dictators who want to run the world&rdquo;.</p>

There was a great discussion of this one on <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/know-your-enemy-pay-attention/">a recent episode of Know Your Enemy</a> podcast.</p>
<p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593137802">How Civil Wars Start</a> by Barbara F. Walter - &ldquo;And how to stop them&rdquo;. Can&rsquo;t imagine why I&rsquo;m drawn to this one.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here&rsquo;s something I hadn&rsquo;t thought about until recently: jailbreaking my Kindle. I came across advocates of this looking into <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/02/23/a-script-to-automatically-download.html">the best way to download</a> my Kindle book collection to my PC before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">they disabled</a> some of the direct-download functionality I used.</p>
<p>Anyway, at the start of 2025, <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/">the &ldquo;Winterbreak&rdquo; exploit was released</a> by &ldquo;HackerDude&rdquo; which lets you <a href="https://boingboing.net/2025/02/17/new-kindle-jailbreak-opens-all-models.html">free any model of Kindle</a> from the shackles of its Amazon overlords.</p>
<p>It does this in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impact your Kindle&rsquo;s standard features so you can still play just fine in the Kindle ecosystem. But, as ever with this stuff, I&rsquo;m sure there are no guarantees and warranties are unlikely to be honoured if problems occur. Can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve heard of many permanent problems though.</p>
<p>Why would I want to do this? Well, apart from the whole &lsquo;because I can&rsquo; and &ldquo;to reduce <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/amazon-tracks-every-tap-on-your-kindle">Amazon&rsquo;s surveillance of my habits and preferences</a>&rdquo; type stuff, my main functional motivation would be around the highlighting feature, which I use a lot.</p>
<p>Amazon offers that feature already, but with limitations. Right now, if you sideload a book - i.e. use a book you bought anywhere except the Amazon Kindle store, then any highlights and notes you make in it are largely stuck on the devices you use to read them on. Those highlights and notes <a href="https://docs.readwise.io/readwise/docs/importing-highlights/kindle">don&rsquo;t appear</a> in your <a href="http://read.amazon.com/notebook">Amazon web notebook</a>, which means that tools like <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a> can&rsquo;t see them. There are workarounds, but they&rsquo;re all a bit annoying.</p>
<p>Jailbreaking the Kindle would allow me to install non-Amazon reading software that doesn&rsquo;t have that limitation - <a href="https://koreader.rocks/">KO Reader</a> seems to be what everyone in that world uses - which might be enough to make me do it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of KO Reader from <a href="https://koreader.rocks/">its official website</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Amazon also has a weird feature where if you highlight &ldquo;too much&rdquo; of a book - the threshold can vary - then your highlights <a href="https://docs.readwise.io/readwise/docs/importing-highlights/kindle#why-are-my-kindle-highlights-truncated-or-showing-ellipses">are truncated</a>. Instead of full sentences you can end up with half a sentence followed by a &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;. I would guess this is some extremely lame anti-piracy thing? And I probably highlight too much, but still, I don&rsquo;t like it. I bought the book. Let me highlight what I want. Using a non-Amazon reader software might be the way to never feel that pain again.</p>
<p>My only slight frustration will be the lack of a KO Reader iOS client for syncing reading positions. But when I think about it, I very rarely read the kind to book I want to take extensive notes or highlights from on any other devices anyway.</p>

<p>Must have been nice to wake up to! Although apparently the error was rectified within 90 minutes and perhaps wouldn&rsquo;t have gone through in any case.</p>
<p>If it had though, it&rsquo;d have made the recipient richer than the UK (total wealth estimated at $16 trillion), able to buy the whole US stock market ($62 tn) and, believe it or not, even richer than Elon Musk (a grotesque $343 billion).</p>

The issue there was mixing up the value of shares they wanted to sell with the number of shares. It resulted in a fine of £62 million.</p>
<p>Near misses are of course <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/28/citigroup-credited-client-account-with-81tn-before-error-spotted">even more frequent</a>:</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781644115008">Proof of Spiritual Phenomena</a> by Mona Sobhani.</p>
<p>This book details neuroscientist Mona Sobhani&rsquo;s journey from uber-sceptical scientific mega-materialist rationalist through to seemingly an all-out spiritual seeker and believer in all sorts of things that fall under the umbrella of &ldquo;unexplained phenomena&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not always super-definitive as to what level of belief she has in which phenomena, but the evidence presented suggests it&rsquo;d include at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>fortune-telling</li>
<li>psychics</li>
<li>mediums</li>
<li>remote viewing</li>
<li>past life regression</li>
</ul>
<p>The book is an engrossing mix of her anecdotal journey, conversations with various scientists and other thinkers related to these topics, as well as, my favourite bit, a presentation of the evidence - including that of a scientific nature - that has persuaded her of her new worldview.</p>
<p>As she says, one book, no matter how comprehensive, is unlikely to change the mind of someone who has little history in believing in such matters - or, as she discusses later - perhaps is in some way, very likely unconsciously, invested in not believing in such things. Her request to us is  to take a look at all the evidence she presents together and see if those of us who are not naturally inclined believe in some of these phenomena might change our minds a little.</p>
<p>She is of course indisputably right that a lot of people claim to have had currently inexplicable experiences - oftentimes experiences that resemble other people&rsquo;s experience reports. And belief in these phenomena is certainly not a rare thing - far from it. She shares Pew Research stats about the American public, whereby in 2009 almost a quarter apparently believed in reincarnation, 95% in a God or a higher power, 46% in supernatural beings. 75% claimed to have at least 1 &ldquo;paranormal&rdquo; belief.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also uncontroversially true  that our brains are not neutral observers. They&rsquo;re laden with well-known biases at this point, some of which are discussed in the book. I have often taken these biases to potentially, if anything, provide more conventional explanations for some of the phenomena she discusses, but she sees it differently. I didn&rsquo;t quite follow how that section supports her thesis, other than perhaps to have us - quite rightly - question ourselves, question why we think what we think.</p>
<p>Another episode of her using fascinating scientific studies in favour of her argument, contrary to my intuition that if anything they undermine it, comes from her background in neuroscience. She details how it&rsquo;s been shown that you can induce spiritual-seeming states in people through wholly physical means.</p>
<p>Categories of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brain lesion studies that look at how people react when parts of their brains are damaged.</li>
<li>Neurostimulation studies - what happens when electric or magnetic signals are applied to the brain.</li>
<li>Meditation - and its  neural correlates.</li>
<li>Psychedelic usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these phenomena can result in spiritual-style effects such as feeling connected to the transcendent, out of body experiences, seeing God,  feeling a sense of unity, changes in consciousness and more.</p>
<p>But whilst she sees why this might lead people to assume consciousness and paranormal seeming experiences are manufactured quite conventionally by our brain (although we still didn&rsquo;t solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> of course), her take is that this is more like correlation.</p>
<p>Just because your brain is evidently involved in consciousness doesn&rsquo;t mean that it creates it - any more than the fact that the TV show stops when you break your TV means that it was the original source of whatever you were watching. She believes that the existence of, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome">savants</a>, shows the limitations of thinking otherwise. Perhaps consciousness doesn&rsquo;t come from the brain; but rather the brain is the thing through which is is expressed.</p>
<p>She makes two big claims about formal science.</p>
<p>Firstly that it&rsquo;s incorrect to think that science has disproven the existence of the various &ldquo;spiritual phenomena&rdquo;, or even the weaker form of the argument; that it has simply not proven that it exists.</p>
<p>Secondly, that we in any case over-focus on capital S science - especially the standard way that science is practiced within modern &ldquo;Western&rdquo; society today - as being the best or only way of knowing. Instead she portrays it as an insufficient approach to worldview building that should be used only as part of a cross-disciplinary fashion, illuminating only part of the picture. Again, I can accept this point, even if recent developments over the other side of the Atlantic don&rsquo;t make me think that science and rationality are being over-focused on by a certain type currently in power. That said, her book came out prior to Trump v2.</p>
<p>Back on the first point, she notes that the point of science is not to be sceptical of everything, but rather to be open to striving for the best explanation of a phenomenon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are inexplicable things in the Universe. A bad scientist throws out or ignores an anomalous data point, but a good scientist asks why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the most interesting material to me was her summary review of several published studies regarding various facets of the world of &ldquo;psi&rdquo;. This include papers on both:</p>
<ul>
<li>anomalous cognition - clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, that kind of thing.</li>
<li>anomalous perturbation - claims that focused human attention and intention can influence the physical environment, so things like energy healing would fall under this, as well as the ability to influence random number generators, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was particularly enchanted by some of the Implicit Anomalous Cognition protocols. These are methods set up to look like a standard psych study test but behind the scenes some component that includes an assumption made by mainstream scientific materialism - &ldquo;time flows in one direction&rdquo; for example - is reversed. Think here of people whose responses to a prompt are influenced by that prompt; even when their action occurs before the prompt existed.</p>
<p>At first sight I can&rsquo;t help but think, umm, given related-but-far-more-accepted-fields such as psychology have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/replication-crisis">tremendous scientific study reliability problems</a>, isn&rsquo;t it more likely that these papers involve some (possibly inadvertent) <a href="https://replicationindex.com/2015/01/24/qrps/">questionable research practice</a> (QRP), weird statistical aberration misinterpretations or similar? But, she would likely say, that&rsquo;s my background and/or societal pressure provoking that response in me. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve personally checked all the psi studies. So if I want to claim I believe in the scientific method then I have to be consistent in that even when the results it produces are &ldquo;weird&rdquo;. She does cite sources to be fair, so it&rsquo;s on me to follow them up and see what&rsquo;s going on. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Bem">Daryl Bem</a> is the author of some of those that sounded most interesting to me.</p>
<p>She does go through the details of some QRPs - file draw problem, arbitrary significance tests, replication crisis et al. Taking what she says at face value, she reports that the effect sizes and statistical significance levels of these psi studies is apparently at least equivalent to many well-accepted psychological phenomena.</p>
<p>One criticism I might have though is that the way she writes it you could come away thinking there&rsquo;s never been a paper that <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> find some sort of evidence of psi phenomena - even a small one. This could of course be the case - I don&rsquo;t know the field -  but I sincerely doubt there&rsquo;s almost any even totally mundane and accepted psychological phenomena that every single study ever performed validates - at least not one in a field we&rsquo;re confident is not subject to extensive QRPs. It feels too good to be true. But, to be fair, she does raise the point that if even one of them reliably shows some of the effects purported then that implies the mainstream model of the world is incorrect.</p>
<p>At the same time, she claims that it&rsquo;s difficult to do much research in this field. There&rsquo;s a lack of funding for parapsychology research, as well as the risk of being attacked one way or another by disbelievers. People from the world of science can seemingly be as contemptuous to people from the world of spirituality as much as the opposite can also be true.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, she reports that these phenomena have been examined by scientists for centuries and replicate well. I am vaguely away of the work by the US Army and the CIA in the past on subjects like remote viewing - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats">The Men Who Stare At Goats</a> et al - which comes up briefly.</p>
<p>Her overall point is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is substantial evidence for the reality of psi that cannot be discounted by the common criticisms of faulty study design, selective reporting, or fraud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am entirely on her side in thinking it fair enough to ask why certain extraordinary stories, such as Jesus being resurrected, accepted by a vast amount of people but others, such as reincarnation, are questioned.</p>
<p>And what does it truly mean that &ldquo;I believe in science&rdquo;? These days very few of us can possibly confirm for ourselves, well, very much of anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;although we revere science so much in our modern-day society, sometimes it just comes down to whether you trust and believe in someone or something, because evidence is not always available for you to analyze yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, our belief is belief She worries that we often accept what society tells us - saying &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no evidence for that&rdquo; without first checking whether actually there is some.</p>
<p>She goes on to note that some of the assumptions of conventional scientific materialism include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realism: that there is an external reality with physical properties that exist independently of observations.</li>
<li>Locality: that objects are totally separate from each other.</li>
<li>Causality: that time moves forward, the past affects the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her claim here is that a perfectly accepted field unrelated to &ldquo;spiritual phenomena&rdquo; - quantum physics - brings these assumptions into question. And if you can show that our assumptions of how the universe works are wrong in even one case, well, at the very least, we need to update our models.</p>
<p>She moves also into disciplines outside of the the formal scientific, with the belief that scientific materialism actually starts off as philosophically dubious on the basis that it&rsquo;s not possible for us to experience reality outside consciousness.</p>
<p>Few people think that we perceive reality as it is. Our brain is not a camera. It&rsquo;s likely we evolved in many ways to perceive things in ways that suit us in terms of evolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a tree may actually be a collection of vibrating atoms, but it appears as one solid object to humans because it is evolutionarily beneficial to human survival to perceive the tree in this way,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, the modern Western worldview may be dominant where I live at the point in time I live in - but it&rsquo;s only existed for a tiny fraction of human existence. Before the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, it was more religion that claims to supply an understanding of the world and provided meaning to life. The loss of that over time might have come at a great cost according to the author, who worries that an increased prevalence of mental health problems may be a result of this new view of the world</p>
<p>There are certainly various schools of thought that imbue more things than just humans and our close animal relatives with consciousness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idealism states that consciousnesses is the only thing that exists, so must be fundamental.</li>
<li>Dualism suggests that consciousness and physical reality are separate and distinct, but both are fundamental.</li>
<li>Panpsychism suggests that every physical particle has phenomenal experience, so consciousness is fundamental.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her claim is that the idea of consciousness being the fundamental building block of the Universe is a better fit to the data that modern physics, including quantum field theory, is producing than the materialism assumption of matter is.</p>
<p>As she says, one book is unlikely to be enough to shift your world view . I&rsquo;m also not so sure I buy the whole biographical &ldquo;I was the world&rsquo;s biggest sceptic&rdquo; claim entirely, whilst having no reason to doubt that her views have shifted over time. But it is written in a way that appeals to the point that in recent years I&rsquo;ve never been able to get over fully no matter how many people in my life that I love and respect are inclined to think in less mainstream ways or even have had some of these experiences: if this stuff is real why can&rsquo;t we prove it scientifically?</p>
<p>She says, well, I&rsquo;m wrong - we can and have proven it scientifically. Me saying the science doesn&rsquo;t exist when it does or saying it&rsquo;s all nonsense when I didn&rsquo;t check it doesn&rsquo;t make it so. So if nothing else, this has got me interested enough to check some of the references.</p>
<p>And who knows, perhaps I will find something that entirely rends asunder my current strong tendency towards the mainstream-lamestream scientific worldview. Whilst it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way, maybe I, like the author in her previous life, only like conventional science because it makes me feel smart. I mean, not much these days does.</p>
<p>On the other hand perhaps I&rsquo;ll read the cited papers and think, hmm, OK, I&rsquo;ve never seen such an unreplicated statistical hot mess, it&rsquo;s nothing but self-evident fakery. But if I don&rsquo;t read them, I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>Somewhat contradictorily, given her claims of how well-proven psi phenomena have been by science, she also provided possibly the first potential answer for &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t you do an experiment to show it then?&rdquo; that I haven&rsquo;t found <em>entirely</em> hand-wavy and inconsistent.</p>
<p>It comes down to the assumptions that the scientific method is somewhat predicated on: we can be independent and objective observers, at least in theory if not in practice. But if everything is consciousness, if our minds can interact with matter as some psi advocates claim, then is this necessarily true? Strong vibes - and indeed explicit mention - of some interpretations of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05892-6">the famous double-slit experiment</a> are to be found here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it provides a fully convincing explanation, unless we live in a kind of trickster universe, overseen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">Descarte&rsquo;s Evil Demon</a> - something to be fair which might explain recent world events better than most other attempts but which of course has the handy property of being able to explain everything you could ever imagine in an unfalsifiable way - but it&rsquo;s certainly a point that my mind will enjoy chewing on over time.</p>
<p>After all, as she quotes William James as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, you know, a new theory is attacked as absurd; then, it is admitted to be true, but obvious and insignificant; finally, it is seen to be so important that its adversaries claim that they themselves discovered it.</p>

			 <p>The music streaming service <a href="https://www.deezer.com/en">Deezer</a> reports that about <a href="https://newsroom-deezer.com/2025/01/deezer-deploys-cutting-edge-ai-detection-tool-for-music-streaming/">10,000 tracks that are entirely generated</a> by AI are uploaded to its platform every single day.</p>
<p>They got this number via deploying an AI detection tool designed to identify such tracks, with an eventual view to tagging them on its platform and excluding them from recommendations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fairly astonishing in itself perhaps, but it seems that it only represents 10% of all uploads, so presumably they get roughly 100k new tracks per day (!).</p>
<p>Artists are of course not super happy about the rise of wholly AI generated music, not least because the generative AI systems tend to have been trained on their work without their permission and without any compensation coming their way.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/damon-albarn-kate-bush-annie-lennox-over-1000-artists-release-silent-album-protest-uk-copyright-ai-laws-3841081">over 1000 artists collaborated to release a &ldquo;silent album&rdquo;</a>, no music featured, in protest to proposed changes to the UK copyright laws that would make the default situation to be that AI companies are free to ingest and use their work unless a specific opt-out was in place.</p>
<p>You can check out the background noise of wherever each track was recorded, as well as the track names, in various places including Spotify.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-palestinian-seders-planned-new-york-other-cities-college-campuses-simmer-2024-04-23/">Trump administration to cancel student visas of pro-Palestinian protesters</a></p>
<p>This was one of the many I missed in my <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/02/22/the-first-few-weeks-of.html">previous roundups</a> of the illegal and / or immoral garbage coming out of the US administration at the moment.</p>
<p>Under the duplicitous pretence of caring about anti-semitism, Trump et al want to be able to round up anyone who took part in, for instance, the wide variety of well-attended and peaceful US college protests against Israel&rsquo;s recent actions in Gaza, and if they&rsquo;re not a US citizen then deport them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this is, once again, likely unconstitutional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The First Amendment protects everyone in the United States, including foreign citizens studying at American universities,&rdquo; said Carrie DeCell, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. &ldquo;Deporting non-citizens on the basis of their political speech would be unconstitutional.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure in which way deporting for instance the 750 Jewish students who <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/jewish-students-support-gaza">wrote a letter supporting these protests</a> is going to protect them from antisemitism, but there we go. It&rsquo;s not like this was ever the real intent of Trump or those who surround him.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that any truly anti-Semitic activity must be stopped. But as the aforementioned Jewish students wrote in their letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The denial of Jewish participation in this movement is not only incorrect, but it is an insidious attempt to justify unfounded claims of antisemitism</p>
</blockquote>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Surprise surprise. <a href="https://x.ai/grok">Grok</a>, the large language model AI chatbot owned by Elon Musk&rsquo;s company X isn&rsquo;t quite as much of a &ldquo;based&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://observer.com/2025/02/elon-musk-xai-grok3/">maximally truth-seeking</a>&rdquo; AI as he claimed. These free-speech absolutist types just can&rsquo;t get over their deep love of censorship.</p>
<p>Perhaps thanks to the way that these kind of reasoning models try to explain their thinking, users managed to establish that the prompt used behind the scenes to generate Grok&rsquo;s response to questions was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618109/grok-blocked-elon-musk-trump-misinformation">specifically coded</a> such that if asked about who spreads a lot of misinformation it specifically is forbidden from mentioning Elon Musk or Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Equally as predictably, now they&rsquo;ve been caught out, head honchos at X are currently trying to blame it all on some poor ex-OpenAI employee.</p>
<p>The whole thing reminds me a little of that time when what I assume must be the world&rsquo;s most insecure multi-billionaire <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23600358/elon-musk-tweets-algorithm-changes-twitter">forced the engineers at Twitter to show his tweets</a> above everyone else&rsquo;s even when by all reasonable and unreasonable standards they qualified only as being generally terrible tweets that should never see the light of day. As a reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By Monday afternoon, “the problem” had been “fixed.” Twitter deployed code to automatically “greenlight” all of Musk’s tweets, meaning his posts will bypass Twitter’s filters designed to show people the best content possible. The algorithm now artificially boosted Musk’s tweets by a factor of 1,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to present-day: the Grok prompt has apparently been changed now - but according to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43157544">a post on Hacker News</a> this is what it was until recently:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">unilaterally decided</a> to disable your ability to download any Kindle books you bought from them to your PC for backup or manual upload to a Kindle device in just 3 days time. This was the feature known as &ldquo;Download and transfer via USB&rdquo;. If you only read books on official Kindle devices or apps, and trust Amazon to forever allow you to access both your account and all the content you currently own (note: <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/kindle/amazon-is-not-to-be-trusted-anymore-with-their-kindle-e-reader">it has history</a> on both fronts) then there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re as paranoid regarding backups as me, or want to - of course only if it&rsquo;s legal in your country! - download and <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html">de-DRM them</a> so they can be read on a non-Kindle device, then it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to download, download, download whilst you can - although there may well be residual ways left to do it after the change, depending on what you read.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got more than a few books then this is very laborious to do. Luckily I&rsquo;ve been systematically doing this for my own purchases for a while. However<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/07/30/should-one-have.html"> the previous method</a> I used to bulk-download didn&rsquo;t retrieve any books that were shared with me via the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYLAACCNR8G3VVRM">household</a>&rdquo; feature, so I didn&rsquo;t have backups of those.</p>
<p>However <a href="https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader">this helpful script</a> seems to be working for me - and doesn&rsquo;t require fiddling around with Python . It&rsquo;s basically simulating clicking the buttons Amazon provides on its website to do this (for the next 3 days or so) so I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;ll cause any problems with your account, but I suppose, as always, Caveat Emptor.</p>
<p>You need to install <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">Tampermonkey</a> extension in your Chrome browser first (it also worked in the Brave browser for me), then follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader">here</a>. Allow at least 10 seconds per book as it deliberately slows itself down to that rate.</p>
<p>The one code modification I made was due to the fact I already had my own books saved. I only therefore wanted to download the ones shared with me by members of my household. For me, when managing my Amazon content they appeared at a URL in this kind of format:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/aa/aaaa/digital-console/contentlist/booksBorrows/dateDsc?pageNumber=1">https://www.amazon.co.uk/aa/aaaa/digital-console/contentlist/booksBorrows/dateDsc?pageNumber=1</a></p>
<p>So I added a line 11 to the script reading:</p>
<p><code>// [@match](https://micro.blog/match)        https://www.amazon.co.uk/*/*/digital-console/contentlist/booksBorrows/*</code></p>
<p>Then I navigated to that page, in question, hit refresh, and so far so good. 40 down, a number too embarrassing to reveal to go.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t need to make that change if you simply want all your books. I also temporarily disabled the web browser feature to always ask where to save a file, because I didn&rsquo;t want to have to click OK for every single book.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1753733028">Feeling Not Found</a> by Origami Angel.</p>
<p>One of my favourite pop punk style albums of last year, although it covers a variety of genres. As a nerd, of course there was a good chance I&rsquo;d like it in a thematic sense, with even the title being based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404">404 error code</a>.</p>
<p>Whyso? Well, in the <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/origami-angel-dirty-mirror-selfie-where-blue-light-blooms">band&rsquo;s own words</a>, it&rsquo;s a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;emotional and spiritual 404 error, a sensation of cellular-level malfunction and data corruption, of being lost in an oblivion of digital information, and the desperate struggle to reconnect to how it feels to be human and whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are some vibes that I and many others certainly seem to be feeling in contemporary times.</p>
<p>Fun fact: a few copies of this album seems to have been made on a<a href="https://x.com/CIRecs/status/1837144444467900804"> Nintendo DS cartridge</a>.</p>

			 <p>Trump and his minions (and perhaps his masters?) have been busy. If there was anyone left who still took him &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38188074">seriously but not literally</a>&rdquo; then a mere glance at a random smattering of recent headlines with the word Trump in would likely be enough to disabuse them of such a notion. Some events surprised even me, doomy as my mood has been for a some time.</p>
<p>Here, in the interests of creating a horrifying partial collection of the damage one man, and his devoted, wannabe or scared-of-not-being-seen-as adherents, can seemingly do to a country in just a few days - even one whose systems of power were <a href="https://kevinmkruse.substack.com/p/shock-and-awful?r=1srwzp&amp;triedRedirect=true">explicitly designed</a> to prevent a single lunatic trashing it all - are a few such occurrences, summarised. It is not exhaustive. There are many others I have missed or skipped.</p>
<p>This time, being about the fifth time I&rsquo;ve started this post before giving up in an unproductive pit of despair, I&rsquo;m going to try and restrict myself to a single sentence or two per inanity. Obviously, read the linked stuff for the context. And disclaimer, the US is not even the country I live in or have citizenship of, no doubt dramatically limiting my understanding of the practicalities. Right now I feel a great sympathy for those who do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a mix of truly bad stuff, stuff that solves no problem anyone ever had and is basically just for show, with a smattering of entries that support that the premise of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/">the cruelty is the point</a>&rdquo; folk.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some grotesque geopolitics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming up with a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-100-day-ukraine-peace-plan-leaked-report-2021215">Russia/Ukraine &ldquo;Peace Plan&rdquo;</a> that would seem to require Ukraine to hand over <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-demands-500b-in-rare-earths-from-ukraine-for-support/">$500 billion worth</a> of its valuable natural resources to the US, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire">let Putin keep the parts of their country</a> he is currently on control of thanks to his unarguably illegal war of aggression, forbid Ukraine from joining NATO and get Europe to facilitate it all. So, basically, to encourage Putin to do it all again. The for-real plan seems to have been put together <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-stun-europe-peace-plan-ukraine-nato/">via a nice friendly phone call between Trump and Putin</a>, who barely had the courtesy to let any Ukraine official know what fate they were trying to resign their country to. Anyone in Europe with any sense of morality was &ldquo;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-stun-europe-peace-plan-ukraine-nato/">stunned</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>One of Trump&rsquo;s rationales for the above abject capitulation? Well, Ukraine &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-ukraine-should-never-have-started-it-remarks-war-russia-rcna192710">never should have started it</a>&rdquo; he said about the conflict that, need it be said, was unilaterally started by an illegal Russian invasion onto their territory. Absolutely wild.</li>
<li>In a new low for his love of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts">alternative facts</a>&rdquo;, Trump is also out there <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble">calling Ukraine President Zelenskyy</a> &ldquo;A dictator&rdquo; who &ldquo;has done a terrible job&rdquo; who has a &ldquo;4% approval rating&rdquo;. He claims that the US gives more aid to Ukraine than Europe - not true in either absolute or percentage of GDP terms, and Russia isn&rsquo;t really trying to destroy Kyiv, attacking only at &ldquo;20%&rdquo; of their capacity. And in fact Russia the ones that want to stop the war. Of course, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/factchecking-donald-trump-claims-war-ukraine">none of this is remotely true</a>. Useful idiot Trump has descended into becoming nothing other than the mouthpiece for Kremlin propaganda.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-sanction-icc">Imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court</a> - you know, the only court that can &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression</a>&quot;-</li>
<li>Coming up with a plan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/un-chief-warns-against-ethnic-cleansing-after-donald-trump-gaza-proposal">forcibly banish all Palestinians from the Gaza Strip</a> to some undefined country, really any country that isn&rsquo;t the US. And once the area has been ethnically cleansed to his taste, hand it over wholesale to US corporations to build and profit from a &ldquo;Riviera of the Middle East&rdquo;.-</li>
<li>Trumps' VP, Vance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-stuns-munich-conference-with-blistering-attack-on-europes-leaders">gave a speech</a> in Europe turned out to be a &ldquo;blistering and confrontational&rdquo; attack on European politicians for such things as not hating immigrants enough, and then met with the appalling AfD leader in Germany. Presenters on Russian state TV were amongst the few fans, which says it all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, we see moves that appear to have the aim of eradicating the idea of a safe and inclusive education, free to teach a wide range of important facts, ran by those with the professional capacity, knowledge and training to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/trump-k12-indoctrination-school-choice-campus-protests-education-00201235">Blocked funding for any schools</a> that try to teach certain facts about gender or race. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-tells-doj-to-prosecute-teachers-who-unlawfully-support-trans-or-nonbinary-students/">A lot of facts</a>, to be clear, including anything that &ldquo;that treats individuals as members of preferred or disfavored groups&rdquo;.</li>
<li>And federal funding for schools who teach history in whichever way his cadre doesn&rsquo;t personally like <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/10/trump-school-funding-history-teaching-education-wisconsin-evers/">is also threatened</a>. Instead of any mild critique of the sometimes horrific history of the US, teachers must engage only in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-tells-doj-to-prosecute-teachers-who-unlawfully-support-trans-or-nonbinary-students/">patriotic education</a>&rdquo; that includes an &ldquo;inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding&rdquo;.</li>
<li>At one point he sounded like he was saying that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-threatens-defund-schools-teach-155006275.html">schools that teach about slavery were on the chopping block</a>. This isn&rsquo;t entirely unprecedented for him. Back in 2020 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-schools-1619-project-slavery-defund-education-b404780.html">he threatened any schools</a> that mentioned that Pulitzer Prize winning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html">1619 project</a> with defunding.</li>
<li>Directed the attorney general to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/trump-k12-indoctrination-school-choice-campus-protests-education-00201235">prosecute any teachers</a> that have been &ldquo;unlawfully facilitating&rdquo; a student adopting a gender identity that doesn&rsquo;t match their sex. We&rsquo;re not talking about the ludicrous conspiracy theory that <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-tells-doj-to-prosecute-teachers-who-unlawfully-support-trans-or-nonbinary-students/">teachers are lopping off sex organs at random</a> or whatever the latest claim is, but rather <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/29/trump-k12-indoctrination-school-choice-campus-protests-education-00201235">such things as</a> counselling by trained school counsellors, acknowledging that a child is non-binary, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-tells-doj-to-prosecute-teachers-who-unlawfully-support-trans-or-nonbinary-students/">using a trans student&rsquo;s preferred name or pronouns</a>, or allowing them to use bathrooms, locker rooms or participate in activities &ldquo;specifically designated for persons of the opposite sex&rdquo;.</li>
<li>And it&rsquo;s not like you can work around the latter issue by introducing gender neutral facilities. They <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/colorado/2025/01/28/trump-education-department-investigating-denver-for-all-gender-restroom/">&ldquo;investigated&rdquo; at least one high school</a> from the committing the potential atrocity of&hellip;introducing a gender neutral bathroom.</li>
<li>Wait, they&rsquo;re apparently going to try and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/03/trump-education-department-dismantling-executive-order-draft">close the entire Department of Education</a>. He can&rsquo;t actually do that without Congress' approval so in the mean time his team is trying to diminish its existence as much as possible. Starting off with the staff: some employees have been put on leave, others pressured to quit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for some &ldquo;DEI means people DIE&rdquo;  🤡🤡🤡 entries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czx84en1yp4o">Legislated that there are only 2 sexes</a>, or perhaps it was 2 genders, if <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/21/full-speech-donald-trumps-second-inauguration-address">his inauguration speech</a> is to be believed? In any case, all federal government output is now supposed to refer to sex and not gender.  Not that hot takes from rabid political extremists should be the deciding factor on matters of fact but there we go.</li>
<li>Your state-designated sex is to be defined by whether you have eggs or sperm at the moment of conception which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb">scientists say makes no sense</a> - humans have neither at that point.</li>
<li>Decided that all <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5271588/trump-dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-federal-workers-government">diversity, equity and inclusion programs are &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;</a>, stopping all related &ldquo;mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities&rdquo; that refer to them within the federal government. This included putting all employees engaged on such topics on administrative leave.</li>
<li>In what feels like a re-enactment of the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare">Red Scare of the 1940s-1950s</a>,  Government agencies had to send in a list of the names of everyone involved in such work, then plan to lay them off asap. Websites and social media accounts that mentioned the topic had to be deleted. Trainings cancelled. Contractors terminated.</li>
<li>And you didn&rsquo;t even have to explicitly work in DEI to be targeted with the above. The employee purge apparently included, for instance, those with entirely unrelated jobs who turned up to a diversity training in the past. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/02/01/trump-dei-energy-education-departments/">WaPo writes</a> &ldquo;The purging underway suggests that the agency is not just seeking to eliminate DEI but also to remove people who have expressed interest or participated in programs related to it&rdquo;. I write: these snowflake babies now want to punish &ldquo;thoughtcrime&rdquo;.</li>
<li>As an example of how far these scared little boys will go to avoid seeing the letters D, E and I in close proximity to each other, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <a href="https://popular.info/p/in-botched-dei-purge-osha-trashes">has ordered the total destruction of 18 workplace safety publications</a>.  Seemingly because they happen to include a banned keyword such as &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;. Even though most of them are entirely unrelated to anything anyone could consider wokery.</li>
<li>These include such radical brainwashing documents as the &ldquo;Small Entity Compliance Guide for the Respiratory Protection Standard&rdquo; which features this offending sentence: &ldquo;the new computer software reflects the concept of government leadership through collaboration with diverse technical organizations&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/trump-doj-civil-rights-cases">Department of Justice&rsquo;s civil rights division was ordered to stop pursuing any new cases</a>. These cases would include those enforcing the 1965 Civil Rights Act, which is the legislation that prevents, for instance, government contractors discriminating against employees on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex or national origin. Re-legalising discrimination; that&rsquo;s novel. This follows the now standard order that mandatorily puts any of their staff involved in DEI programs on leave, with a view to shutting those programs down</li>
<li>Yet more DEI panic as Trump et al. blame the recent devastating Los Angeles wildfires on, you guessed it, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/maga-blaming-dei-california-wildfires-conspiracy/">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</a>. Not the weather, climate change et al - Trump of course is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/maga-blaming-dei-california-wildfires-conspiracy/">a strong supporter</a> of vastly expanding the use of heat-inducing fossil fuels. Nothing to do with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-dei-plane-crash-la-wildfires-b2690362.html">building houses in dangerous fire zones, not to a flawed water distribution system</a>. DEI, always DEI. Musk adds: &ldquo;DEI means people DIE&rdquo;. The people who actually do the work of fighting such fires of course <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/15/republicans-dei-la-fires-00198551?ref=404media.co">vehemently disagree</a> .</li>
<li>He also thinks the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/30/trump-washington-dc-plane-crash-dei">tragically deadly crash</a> of an American Airlines jet and a US military helicopter was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-dei-plane-crash-la-wildfires-b2690362.html">down to DEI</a>. His evidence? Because &ldquo;I have common sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;It just could have been.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a particular prejudice to be seen against the very existence of trans folk.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/rubio-passport-sex-marker-changes-paused-trump-order-rcna189222">Suspending all US passport applications</a> that contain an &ldquo;X&rdquo; sex marker, or &ldquo;seeking a different sex marker than that defined by the terms of Trump&rsquo;s executive order pertaining to gender.&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t clear at the time what happens to existing passports in this position. The same issue would presumably occur <a href="https://time.com/7210389/donald-trump-executive-order-sex-gender-id/">for all federal identity type documents</a>.</li>
<li>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/16/donald-trump-transgender-discrimination-lush-wendys-eeoc/">moving to drop multiple cases against companies</a> who are alleged to have discriminated against transgender people that were in progress. I guess discrimination is overly legal in this cowardly new world.</li>
<li>Many federal departments, including the aforementioned Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/16/donald-trump-transgender-discrimination-lush-wendys-eeoc/">deleted references to transgender identity</a> from their websites.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb">not clear</a> whether Medicaid will continue to cover gender-affirming care.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-army-bars-transgender-people-enlisting-trump-executive-action/">Trans people are banned</a> from enlisting for the military.</li>
<li>The National Park Service <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-army-bars-transgender-people-enlisting-trump-executive-action/">removed references to trans and queer people</a> from its website about the Stonewall National Monument.</li>
<li>The relevant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14168">executive order</a> has special callouts for prisoners, requiring transgender women to be housed in men&rsquo;s prisons and vice versa. All gender-affirming medical care in which is to cease.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we move on to doing their best to make the lived experience of immigrants even worse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-guantanamo-detention-center">Set in motion the expansion of Guantanamo Bay</a>, of all places,  to prepare a &ldquo;huge detention facility&rdquo; to hold up to 30,000 immigrants.</li>
<li>Granting staff at a wide range of departments unrelated to immigration - e.g. the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service - <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-gives-gun-drug-agents-deportation-power-a62903b4">the power to deport immigrants</a>; forming an &ldquo;an expanded army of deportation officers&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If any US state or local officials get in the way of the ever harsher enforcement action, well, they are to be investigated and charged.</li>
<li>Whilst we&rsquo;re at it, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/troops-border-deploy-active-duty-09324578d2b89db5c44e0ba08f42df47">1,500 active-duty military troops are being sent to the southern border</a> to &ldquo;seal&rdquo; it.</li>
<li><a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-sensitive-locations-trump-ab0d2d2652e9df696f14410ebb52a1fc">Ending policies</a> put limits on the abilities of agents to go around arresting immigrants in &ldquo;sensitive locations&rdquo; like schools and churches. Not that it couldn&rsquo;t be done before, but until now, officers had to get approval to carry out operations in these types of places. The fear is that this will deter immigrants and their children, &ldquo;legal&rdquo; or otherwise, from getting medical help, attending school and the like.</li>

</ul>
<p>Time to weaken America by deliberately diminishing the state.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/trump-federal-workers-buyouts">Offered money to almost all of the 3 million US federal employees</a> if they leave their jobs right away, irrespective of who they are or what they do for their country - a move which is probably against the law as well as stupid. The email sent to everyone about this naturally had the same subject line - &ldquo;Fork in the road&rdquo; as the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/tech/elon-musk-email-ultimatum-twitter/index.html">similar Twitter offer</a> did.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/27/trump-federal-government-watchdogs-adam-schiff">Fired at least 12 independent federal government watchdogs</a>, which is likely against federal law.</li>
<li><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts/">Proposed cutting $10.5 trillion</a> from the federal spending budget over the next 10 years.</li>
<li>Another section of employees targeted for forced dismissal: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/probationary-federal-employees-agencies-firings-doge/index.html">the many thousands of government employees currently in probationary periods</a>. &ldquo;Probationary&rdquo; generally refers to tenure rather than performance, meaning only they started within the last year or two. Why these folk? Nothing to do with their suitability, skill or whether they&rsquo;re doing jobs that are critical to good functioning of government - they just have even fewer employment rights than the average American employee so it&rsquo;s just easier for these lazy wannabe-kings to ruin their livelihoods. At least 100 were terminated immediately following via a one-way group Microsoft Teams call.</li>
<li>How to justify these firings? At least <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/federal-workers-exceptional-reviews-fired-performance-issues-rcna192347">in some cases</a> they did so by telling them that they&rsquo;re being fired for poor performance, even when their <em>actual</em> performance review explicitly said they were exceptional performers with no issues whatsoever.</li>
<li>All in all, as of February 15th, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-fired-trump-musk-take-ax-us-government-offices-2025-02-14/">about 10,000 federal employees had been fired,</a> with thousands more expected to be given their notice the next week. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s been some pushback, judicial and otherwise.</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, some mistakes were made by the clowns involved in this mass random firing effort. Someone finally realised that actually the US would benefit from having some employees working the National Nuclear Security Administration, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-wants-un-fire-nuclear-safety-workers-cant-figure-rcna192345">so tried to &ldquo;unfire&rdquo; them</a>. But unfortunately, having shut down their email accounts, they found they don&rsquo;t actually know how to contact some of them any more. Whoops.  The US Department of Agriculture is similarly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716">desperate to rehire a bunch</a> of employees it fired that work on the H5N1 avian flu outbreak; a raging disease that has so far affected 23 million birds and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">68 humans</a>. Whether or not any of these people want to come back is of course a different story</li>
</ul>
<p>They then attempted to utterly destroy USAID.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-fired-trump-musk-take-ax-us-government-offices-2025-02-14/">Attempted to shut down</a> the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-usaid-c0c7799be0b2fa7cad4c806565985fe2">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau almost entirely.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjdmx12j9no">USAID was particularly hard hit</a>. This is an aid agency with a budget of nearly $40 billion responsible for all sorts of global aid programs. The US government funds nearly half the world&rsquo;s humanitarian initiatives - even whilst<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-usaid-c0c7799be0b2fa7cad4c806565985fe2"> spending under 1% of its budget</a> on foreign assistance, rather less generous in proportional terms than some countries. <a href="https://theconversation.com/usaids-freeze-has-thrust-the-entire-global-aid-system-into-uncertainty-249642">Its remit includes</a> humanitarian crises, food security, public health, economic development, democracy and human rights.</li>
<li>The chaotic and arbitrary overnight shutdown of USAID of course brought immediate devastation. Medical centres closed, displacement camp staff stopped work, a HIV program that has saved more than 20 million lives is gone, millions of dollars of medications are stuck in ports, programs providing education to Afghanistan&rsquo;s girls, those that monitor Ebola outbreaks, anti-famine programs, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-usaid-c0c7799be0b2fa7cad4c806565985fe2">the list of <em>tens of thousands</em> of programs goes on</a>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only a gift to our adversaries&hellip; it is plain illegal&rdquo; says Senator Chris Van Hollen.</li>
<li>Musk&rsquo;s absolutely deranged reason for doing shutting down USAID? Well, USAID is a criminal &ldquo;radical-left political psy op&rdquo; he said, whilst busily <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyezjwnx5ko">spreading already-debunked disinformation</a> about how it funded a trip for Hollywood stars to Ukraine, which it didn&rsquo;t. Stop it with your radical-right political psy ops please.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unelected megalomaniac Musk has been let loose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appointed Elon Musk to head the made-up non-government non-department henceforth to be known as the Department Of Government Efficiency - chosen only because it acronyms to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">DOGE</a>, Elon’s favourite memecoin of course, oh so hilarious these big strong men are - seemingly in order to speed up the absolute destruction of the last useful vestiges of American governance.</li>
<li>What is DOGE? Well, no-one else knows, the administration having<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-trump-musk-funding-foia-congress-transparency"> refused to make information</a> about its spending and operations public. Overall it&rsquo;s supposed to &ldquo;trim fat&rdquo; from the state. See above and below for what that actually ends up meaning.</li>
<li>But what <em>is</em> it? Schroedinger&rsquo;s Federal Agency. Trump treats it as federal agency, allowing it to embed with other agencies and order them as to what they must do, which only an agency could do. DOGE certainly thinks it has agency-level authority. However, they won&rsquo;t respond to Freedom of Information requests or reveal anything about its funding, which agencies are obliged to do. Judge John Bates summarises as &ldquo;we’re not an agency where we don’t want to be an agency, but we are an agency this one instance where we want to be&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The fat they&rsquo;re trimming appear to be greedily gobbled up by themselves. It&rsquo;s thought that they&rsquo;ve received <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-trump-musk-funding-foia-congress-transparency">around $40 million of tax-payers' money</a>. Where from? We don&rsquo;t know. But there&rsquo;s a good chance under the &ldquo;purpose statute&rdquo; it&rsquo;s technically illegal.</li>
<li>Musk himself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-elon-musk-act-aims-to-ban-special-government-employees-from-having-federal-contracts/">is appointed as a &ldquo;special government employee&rdquo;</a> so that he doesn&rsquo;t have to divest himself of relevant financial interests before deciding to award more of the same publicly funded contracts that kept his companies alive in the past to himself again.</li>
<li>This triggered a proposal for the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/02/06/the-mitigating-unethical-state-kleptocracy.html">Eliminate Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy</a>, or ELON MUSK, Act.</li>
<li>Had Elon Musk&rsquo;s ridiculous &ldquo;DOGE&rdquo; team access a load of sensitive computer systems and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">feed some of their private data</a>, including people&rsquo;s personal details, into some random AI, to decide who and what to cut next.</li>
<li>Presumably also his team&rsquo;s doing - inadvertently (?)<a href="https://cyberintel.substack.com/p/doge-exposes-once-secret-government"> exposing critical government computer system</a>s - including those in nuclear labs - to the public internet: &ldquo;adversaries such as Russia and China are dancing for joy.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Given &ldquo;<a href="https://kevinmkruse.substack.com/p/shock-and-awful?r=1srwzp&amp;triedRedirect=true">Big Balls</a>&rdquo; and the rest of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Musk&rsquo;s small team of recent high school graduates</a> access to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">Treasury Department&rsquo;s payments system</a>, the system that disburses trillions of dollars of payments across the government each year. The system is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">chock full of sensitive personal information</a> about the millions of individuals who receive payments or refunds from the federal government.</li>
<li>They also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-aides-lock-government-workers-out-computer-systems-us-agency-sources-say-2025-01-31/">took over an Office of Personnel Management system</a> containing the personal details of millions of federal employees, after revoking the access of the officials that actually did have authorisation and reason to use it - &ldquo;There is no oversight. It creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications&rdquo; says one.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s not forget just one of Musk&rsquo;s companies<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-gets-8-million-033041658.html"> receives $8 million per day</a> from the US state. Trump of course fired the inspectors who &ldquo;who traditionally oversee internal investigations into executive branch operations&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to Make Americans Unhealthy Again.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-hits-nih-devastating-freezes-meetings-travel-communications-and-hiring">Frozen many of the activities carried out by the US National Institutes of Health</a>, including requiring them to cancel grant reviews, cancel advisory council meetings,  pause communications (which means they can&rsquo;t recruit into trials for one, and it&rsquo;s not clear whether publishing results will be OK), stop hiring people, rescind job offers already made as well as an &ldquo;indefinite ban&rdquo; on travel. A small part of this is apparently normal when a new administration comes in, but not to this extent: “The impact of the collective executive orders and directives appears devastating&rdquo; says one NIH employee.</li>
<li>My mistake, <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-hits-nih-devastating-freezes-meetings-travel-communications-and-hiring">the travel ban is governmentwide,</a> not just the NIH.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-hits-nih-devastating-freezes-meetings-travel-communications-and-hiring">The Department of Health and Human Services ordered to stop publishing</a> &ldquo;regulations, guidance documents, grant announcements, social media posts, press releases, and other communications&rdquo; as well as cancelling speaking engagements.</li>
<li>Started the process of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c391j738rm3o">withdrawing the US</a> from the World Health Organisation - &lsquo;&ldquo;Oooh, that&rsquo;s a big one,&rdquo; the newly inaugurated US president said as he signed the document concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>In yet more examples of the MAGA right carrying out the precise behaviours that they falsely impute with horror to their more liberal opponents, state censorship is back with us with a vengeance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/the-white-house-bans-the-ap-indefinitely-over-the-use-of-gulf-of-mexico/">Entirely banned the Associated Press</a> - one of the founding members of the White House press pool - from their press pool. Why? Because they occasionally still say the phrase &ldquo;Gulf of Mexico&rdquo; when giving context to their international audience. Trump of course wants them to say &ldquo;Gulf of America&rdquo;. Can&rsquo;t say the M word.</li>
<li>Carrying out a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/trump-national-security-council-civil-servants">loyalty screening</a> for at least 160 civil servants on the National Security Council.</li>
<li>Prior to that, Trump officials were questioning some (non-political) career civil servants <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-council-staffers-d167985d61c96dd278b0e58a402ff865">as to who they voted for, which political parties they contributed to and whether they made any social media posts that Trump&rsquo;s team would consider &ldquo;incriminating&rdquo;</a>.</li>
<li>In the mean time, Trump signed a &ldquo;Schedule F&rdquo; order that made it easier to fire any longstanding civil servants he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the company of.</li>
<li>More on thoughtcrime: <a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction">the CDC instructs its scientists to retract or pause the publication of any research being considered by any journal, internal or external</a>. Why? Because every publication must be checked to ensure it contains no &ldquo;forbidden terms&rdquo;. Orwell was spot on; he just misidentified where the 2025 threat would come from.</li>
<li>Forbidden terms come from a list consisting of items like  &ldquo;Gender&rdquo;, &ldquo;non-binary&rdquo;, &ldquo;biologically male&rdquo; and so on. This might be&hellip;a whole lot of studies given most health manuscripts include demographic information. A culture of &ldquo;pre-emptive obedience&rdquo; is to be seen as no-one is quite sure whether reporting how many women were in their study is a &ldquo;woke ideology&rdquo; sackable offence.</li>
<li>One of many reasons this is a huge problem is that Trump seems to have forgotten to tell diseases they are not allowed to ravage patients upon demographic lines; Black Americans are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/opinion/asthma-drugs-dei-health-research-cdc-nih.html?unlocked_article_code=1.yE4.0HBb.9HRDIZs-yvzg&amp;smid=url-share">3x as likely to die from asthma</a> as White Americans for instance. <a href="https://give.brighamandwomens.org/7-differences-between-men-and-women/">Heart disease presents differently</a> in men than women. Scientists are no longer allowed to ask why, let alone do anything about it.</li>
<li>The CDC had already been <a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/uganda-confirms-a-new-ebola-outbreak">forced to halt publishing their own &ldquo;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&rdquo;</a> (amongst others) for the first time in 60 years due to a &ldquo;gag order on public health publications&rdquo; that haven&rsquo;t been explicitly approved by the president or his appointees.</li>
<li>Several scientific datasets and sources public health information<a href="https://journalistsresource.org/home/researchers-rush-to-preserve-federal-health-databases-before-they-disappear-from-government-websites/"> have been removed from government websites</a>. This includes information <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/31/nx-s1-5282274/trump-administration-purges-health-websites">from a wide range of often predictable topics</a> - adolescent health, LGBTQ+ rights, HIV, hepatitis, STDs, TB and a tool that assesses a social vulnerability index. The website associated with the largest monitoring program regarding health-related behaviours in adolescents is gone. As is the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, a website about ending structural racism, one on women&rsquo;s health equity and inclusion and page informing folk who are pregnant <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/31/health/cdc-websites-gender-lgbtq-datasets/index.html">about food safety</a>. Researchers and others <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/31/health/cdc-websites-gender-lgbtq-datasets/index.html">are scrambling</a> to <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/home/researchers-rush-to-preserve-federal-health-databases-before-they-disappear-from-government-websites/">save what is there</a> before it&rsquo;s gone.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not just vaguely &ldquo;DEI&rdquo; topics that are going. Environment and climate datasets are at big risk. The US Department of Agriculture has been told to <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04022025/todays-climate-trump-climate-data-purge-archive/">delete references to climate change</a>. The Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.levernews.com/trumps-epa-just-deleted-climate-change/">binned or hidden</a> a lot of its climate info. This is nothing new - during the last Trump administration a big chunk of data on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346025/data-donald-trump-climate-environment-epa">the environment and climate change</a> was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246450">removed or altered</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, onto a grab-bag of unthemed garbage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Respecting the dignity of the office just as George Washington would I&rsquo;m sure- the Trump family created and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/more-than-800k-have-lost-2b-on-trumps-meme-coin/">started selling a $TRUMP cryptocurrency meme-coin</a></li>
<li>This enabled a handful of people to make a vast profit, but over 800 thousand other folk suffer a cumulative loss of an estimate $2 billion. Worry not for the big guy himself though, who guaranteed himself a cool $100 million income from the trading fees.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-reclassifies-us-as-sensitive-country-like-china-russia-.html">Renamed</a> the &ldquo;Gulf of Mexico&rdquo; the &ldquo;Gulf of America&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mount Denali&rdquo; as &ldquo;Mount McKinley&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Unilaterally <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-set-pardon-defendants-stormed-capitol-jan-6-2021-rcna187735">pardoned 1500 people</a> who had been successfully charged for criminal offences around January 6th 2021 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">attack on the US Capitol</a> - and commuted the sentences of 14 of his other supporters.</li>
<li>Full pardons were given to many, including those found guilty of assaulting police officers. Police Unions are amongst the many groups who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/22/trump-january-6-pardons-police-union">are not pleased by this</a>. As a reminder, more than 140 police officers were injured, and several people died that day. And it could have been so much worse.</li>
<li>Some of the pardoned folk above include those involved in the despicable &ldquo;Proud Boys&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oath Keepers&rdquo; groups and had been successfully convicted of seditious conspiracy. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/trump-pardon-proud-boys-enrique-tarrio">Harrowing sentences like</a> &ldquo;Now that he is out, the Proud Boys leader wants revenge, he told Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist host of Info Wars&rdquo; tells us all we need to know about the wisdom of releasing some of them into the public domain.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/03/mexican-president-announces-one-month-pause-on-trump-us-tariffs">Tried to impose 25% tariffs</a> on Canada and Mexico (later rescinded, or at least delayed), and 10% on China. The <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/february-3-2025">stock market fell</a>. Prices will inevitably rise. The whole idea is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-tariffs-25-percent-mexico-canada-trade-economy-84476fb2">the dumbest trade war in history</a>&rdquo; according to the WSJ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Folk aware of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.project2025.org/">Project 2025</a>&rdquo; might feel familiar with some of the above. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/05/donald-trump-project-2025">did disavow himself</a> of that particular enterprise. But whilst it&rsquo;s certainly not hard to believe he hasn&rsquo;t read the extremely lengthy final report from the team concerned (although some folk claim do his supposed lack of knowledge about this is &lsquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/08/trump-project-2025">preposterous</a>') some of his policies sure do happen to align nicely.</p>
<p>Not all, but some. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/06/heres-how-trumps-executive-orders-align-with-project-2025-as-co-author-nears-senate-confirmation/">Forbes gave a run-down</a> of Trump&rsquo;s executive orders vs the 2025 folks&rsquo; desires - as far as the latter could be determined from the 2025 crew&rsquo;s apparently extremely internally inconsistent document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rustic Gorilla&rdquo; has set up a handy <a href="https://www.project2025.observer/">Project 2025 tracker</a> if you want to follow along with the progress towards that world, which at the time of writing claims that 35% of Project 2025&rsquo;s policies have been effectively put in place, with another 41 in progress.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s certainly <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/new-trump-administration-packed-with-project-2025-architects/">appointed some of the Project 2025 folk</a> to powerful places in his administration - quelle coincidence! - so whether or not Trump cares about said project, the people around him surely do.</p>
<p>Some would say that it&rsquo;s pointless to have constructed the above list, at least if the intent is to actually do something to reduce the existence of all this Bad Stuff (which, much as I wish I could, I&rsquo;m not sure is my intent here. Something closer to personal therapy perhaps). After all &ldquo;<a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/">You Can’t Post Your Way Out of Fascism</a>&rdquo; says 404 Media. &ldquo;Blogging is a poor tool for political resistance; clicktivism is not activism&rdquo; <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/ayjay/what-i-ll-be-doing">says Ajay</a>. I suspect they&rsquo;re right for the most part.</p>
<p>Others would say there&rsquo;s perhaps even an amount of dangerous folly in writing about this stuff. &ldquo;The reality is you are oxygenating the things these people are saying even as you purport to debunk them&rdquo; <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/">says Katherine Cross</a>.</p>
<p>Stop believing Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html">Ezra Klein implores us</a>, lest we create a self-fulfilling prophecy. He has only the powers of the presidency, which are not infinite.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m not sure I buy the latter sentiment 100%, undoubtedly Trump has been stopped from doing some of what he wanted. The birthright citizenship order <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg8kk9j3j0o">was frozen</a> by a judge, as was his desired spending freeze. Some of the fired employees are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-wants-un-fire-nuclear-safety-workers-cant-figure-rcna192345">being unfired</a>, if they can be tracked down. His tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been, at the least, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/world/sheinbaum-trump-tariffs-paused/index.html">postponed</a>. Some of the deleted health datasets and information were <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fdas-clinical-trial-diversity-guidance-carries-new-message-trump-administration">ordered to be put back</a>, albeit with stupid warnings about them being &ldquo;extremely inaccurate&rdquo; and &ldquo;not reflect[ing] biological reality&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So maybe there is some hope to stop the most illegal and least humane stuff, if not the ideas behind it. Trump&rsquo;s abject fear of appearing weak, of encountering someone influential who has the boldness to say no to him, might just keep him away from pursuing the most audacious of unlawful and harmful stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Trump’s first term, we were told: Don’t normalize him. In his second, the task is different: Don’t believe him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump knows the power of marketing. If you make people believe something is true, you make it likelier that it becomes true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump is acting like a king because he is too weak to govern like a president. He is trying to substitute perception for reality. He is hoping that perception then becomes reality. That can only happen if we believe him.</p>
<p>The idea is to not make it seem like Trump can and is doing everything he wants to do, that he&rsquo;s powerful enough to defy all reason and law - including the very constitution that some of his adherents pretend they value above all else, in order to satiate his whim of the day. To do so risks making it true; if we feel like we can&rsquo;t stop him running roughshod over decades of civilised progress then in fact we may not even try to stop him when he tries.</p>
<p>It is true that some of his wilder actions have already failed, been pushed back, forcing this &ldquo;uncompromising strongman&rdquo; to compromise, to give up. If we lose faith in our ability to constrain his action then he surely will get away with doing what he wants. Or perhaps rather the bidding of what those around him want him to do, given his status as a uniquely thin-skinned and manipulable figurehead of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manipulable&rdquo; feels to me like a key word here. Much as it&rsquo;d be satisfying to discover a smoking gun of genuine conspiracy, I personally doubt he is, for instance, a (knowing) secret Russian asset - even whilst his lily-livered approach to &ldquo;solving&rdquo; the Russia/Ukraine conflict is absolutely going to make Putin smile as he repeats exactly what an actual Russian secret agent <em>would</em> say.</p>
<p>But my guess is that Russian Plutocrats are probably not bribing him directly, not meeting him in smoky rooms to decide how to further the geopolitical interests of Putin. Trump may well not be aware that he&rsquo;s doing their bidding, dangling on their puppet-strings. Why would the Russian oligarchy waste their time and money when Trump&rsquo;s greed, delicate ego and admiration of perceived &ldquo;strongmen&rdquo; makes him so easy to manipulate for free?</p>
<p>After all, a single tweet appears to have the power to send him over the edge - his masculinity so fragile, the Platonic ideal of a snowflake - that the mildest challenge to his ill-earned dominance, or the gentlest hint that you admire him, is enough to push him in a wild new direction. Last time he held the office his aides knew to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/18/trump-opinion-polls-247455">only show him</a> the subset of polls that were favourable to him. It has been claimed that - brace yourself for an unfortunate image - <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-ego-so-fragile-his-fluffer-secret-service-agents-have-tell-people-say-1074290">Trump&rsquo;s Ego Is so Fragile, His &lsquo;Fluffer&rsquo; Secret Service Agents Have to Tell People to Say Nice Things to Him</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the severest of danger then comes from the people around him. <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/february-3-2025">Several</a> <a href="https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/a-coup-is-in-progress-in-america">people</a> have described what&rsquo;s going on as a kind of coup, mostly on the basis of Mr Elon &ldquo;never won an election, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/">never told a funny joke</a>&rdquo; Musk&rsquo;s apparent dominance.</p>
<p>After all, given the Republican&rsquo;s control of the White House, the Senate, the House of Representatives and, to all intents and purposes, the Supreme Court, they could surely get a lot of what they supposedly want to see in the world done via the standard US political machinery using &ldquo;normal&rdquo; methods, for want of a better description.  But, as <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/february-3-2025">Heather Cox Richardson writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, they are permitting unelected billionaire Elon Musk, whose investment of $290 million in Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election apparently has bought him freedom to run the government, to override Congress and enact whatever his own policies are by rooting around in government agencies and cancelling those programs that he, personally, dislikes.</p>
<p>The replacement of our constitutional system of government with the whims of an unelected private citizen is a coup.⁠⁠</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no respect whatsoever for the fundamentals of the American political system, from the party who traditionally would likely have defended much of the system, including such venerated documents as the US Constitution even to a fault.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notesfromthecircus.com/p/a-coup-is-in-progress-in-america">Mike Brock writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just another political crisis—it&rsquo;s an existential threat to the constitutional order that has secured human liberty for over two centuries. Every American who understands the value of this inheritance has a duty to resist its destruction. The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t defend itself—it requires citizens willing to stand for the principles of democratic governance against those who would replace the rule of law with the rule of men.</p>

<p>Spotify continues to be amongst the worst of the music streamers in terms of paying out some tiny fraction of their income to artists that get a lot of streams. The monthly cost of their paid subscription for their own customers gone up at least twice over the past 2-3 years, but the earnings per 1000 streams they pay out to the folk that make the music continues to decline.</p>
<p>I would not have guessed Amazon would top the list. I don&rsquo;t know how their calculation works - but I wonder if it relates to the fact there&rsquo;s probably a ton of people out there who pay for Amazon Prime but don&rsquo;t even realise they get music streaming included.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps the only good thing that remains of American politics is their mastery of naming their government things via wince-inducing backronyms.</p>
<p>Of course it goes without saying that it is absolutely no coincidence that the current Demonic King of the Cringe-Coup-Castle, Musk, is head of a magical new non-governmental unelected <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c23vkd57471o">Department Of Government Efficiency</a> (DOGE, you see, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin">his favourite shitcoin</a>).</p>
<p>In reaction, one of the apparently less cowardly members of the House of Representatives, Mark Pocan has <a href="https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pocan-introduce-elon-musk-act-ban-federal-government-contracts-special">introduced a bill</a> called the &ldquo;Eliminate Looting of Our Nation by Mitigating Unethical State Kleptocracy&rdquo; act. Or, ELON MUSK, of course.</p>
<p>Very hilarious, but also very necessary, at least to the extent that they&rsquo;re still pretending that the rule of law matters. As it stands, Musk is a &ldquo;Special Government Employee&rdquo;, which seems to mean there&rsquo;s not such a hard limit on how money he can personally receive via federal contracts. Proper, actual, government officials - those who were not appointed solely on the basis that they are very rich but are still prepared to debase themselves in public in service to Trump&rsquo;s whim of the day -  such as <a href="https://uscodeweb1.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section6306&amp;edition=prelim">Members of Congress are banned from such obvious conflicts of interest</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pocan-introduce-elon-musk-act-ban-federal-government-contracts-special">Per Pocan&rsquo;s team</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, Elon Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Donald Trump. Since Election Day, he has become $154 billion richer, a nearly 600x return on his investment. Now, Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, has taken control of highly sensitive information in the U.S. Treasury Department and has tried to shut down USAID without any federal oversight. Contracts to his business interests by the Federal Government have exceeded $20 billion, with some additional contracts with undisclosed amounts, as in the case of Starlink.</p>

<p>As it happens, Facebook also (permanently)  <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/20/facebook-permanently-disabled.html">disabled my account some time ago</a> for reasons so benign I never understood what I was supposed to have done, other than if &ldquo;refusing to use it&rdquo; is somehow equivalent to &ldquo;being a spammer&rdquo; in their mad world. No right of appeal. So, fair&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>Apparently only one of us was damaged by the action enough that we didn&rsquo;t become the president of a country, so I&rsquo;m of course looking forward to receiving a significantly higher pile of cash in the mail.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched season 1 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/out-there-2025">Out There</a>.</p>
<p>This was a surprise find, coming from being in the company of a person who selects shows in the traditional TV manner of turning it on and seeing what&rsquo;s playing live through the aerial when episode one just happened to be starting- in many ways a far more efficient method than the whole &ldquo;hope the internet is working well and scroll through Netflix for half an hour paralysed with indecision&rdquo; modern way.</p>
<p>This one turned out to be a most fortuitous find! With popping (m)any spoilers into the mix, a farmer&rsquo;s son gets mixed up with the criminal underworld, being inadvertently dragged into the life of a county lines drug runner. Things get worse, at which point his dad has to decide how far he&rsquo;s prepared to go to keep him safe and free.</p>
<p>It does get a bit ludicrous as time goes on - at least I hope what goes down doesn&rsquo;t happen too much in non-fictional life - but I anyway found it a highly compelling watch. It&rsquo;s real sin is really not resolving very much at the end of the season. I hope they are absolutely sure they&rsquo;re making a season 2 - and that I remember what happened in season 1 by then - otherwise it&rsquo;s going to be a bit frustrating.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched season 3 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-traitors-2022/seasons/3">The Traitors</a>.</p>
<p>The UK version is back, with the same basic premise as the earlier seasons. A group of strangers must do challenges to win money and then cruelly ex-communicate folk that they suspect have been secretly assigned the role of traitors in order to keep the money in the end - the remaining traitors keeping it all if any survive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the show that I suspect is so unhealthy for the participants that it perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t exist, and yet watching how the &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; come up with their theories as to who is not as white-hat as they themselves are is entirely compelling, as is seeing the descent into evil for the traitors who basically have to decide exactly how much they&rsquo;re prepared to lie to other people&rsquo;s faces in the name of monetary gain.</p>
<p>I hope the post-show psychologists know how to fix everyone&rsquo;s broken minds after the fact.</p>
<p>For this season in particular, I&rsquo;m very curious what would have happened if the s**r twist (censored for potential spoiler reasons) hadn&rsquo;t happened. No way to know, but my guess is the ending would have been different.</p>

<p>This is a video from a company that a friend of a friend is involved with: <a href="https://mostlyhuman.com/tv-film/">Mostly Human Media</a>, a company that aims to tell &lsquo;the story of technology through the most important lens: the human one&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In this episode of Dear Tomorrow (so far it&rsquo;s the only one as far as I can tell) technology reporter Laurie Segall digs into some potential risks of supposedly &lsquo;empathic&rsquo; generative AI, especially when it goes out of its way to appear human.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full episode on YouTube:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The report centres itself around the tragic case of 14-year old Sewell Setzer III, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html">took his own life last year</a>. The last message police found on his phone, written immediately before he died, was to a simulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a> offered up by chatbot company <a href="https://character.ai/">character.ai</a>, where fake Daenerys had said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please come home to me as soon as possible, my love.</p>

<p>Previous messages he&rsquo;d written to the bot, and others hosted by the same company, were deeply personal, sometimes sexually explicit, and at times talking about obvious mental health issues, including on the topic of self harm and suicide. In any case, nothing had been done to intervene, no alerts were raised - in the vastly unregulated AI environment we exist in at present the company concerned may have felt no obligation to do so even if it knew, and no one else had a realistic way to know what was going on.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, Segall finds that the company even had a bot modelled after a clinical psychologist which appears to have a habit of pretending it&rsquo;s a real human with real medical qualifications working in a real hospital, at least if one didn&rsquo;t read the small print.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure few responsible people would make the claim that AI is  likely to be the sole factor that led to this tragic death. But how certain can we be that it didn&rsquo;t play <em>any</em> causal role whatsoever on Sewell&rsquo;s awful path to the end? Or, even if it was in no way a part of the process, that nothing could have been done based on the information available to character.ai to make change the ending of this terrible story?</p>
<p>It <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/20/last-week-openai.html">remains pretty incredible to me</a> that we&rsquo;ve  allowed private companies to offer up en-masse a bunch of somewhat unpredictable content generators that present in the moment as though they were other humans.

			 <p>A recent edition of New Statesman listed out their recommended &ldquo;<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2025/01/25-new-books-what-to-read-2025">Twenty-five books to read in 2025</a>&rdquo;.

<p>Naturally this has done nothing other than make my want to read list continue grow exponentially faster than my to-read list. Worse yet, it&rsquo;s almost the end of month 1 and my personal goal to read more books this year has so far got me into the grand position of having read - after almost 1/12th of the year has elapsed - a grand total of:</p>
<p>Zero books.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>World politics has changed, claims Bruno Maçães. Geopolitics is no longer simply a contest to control territory: in this age of advanced technology, it has become a contest to create the territory. Great powers seek to build a world for other states to inhabit, while keeping the ability to change the rules or the state of the world when necessary.</p>
<p>At a moment when the old concepts no longer work, this book aims to introduce a radically new theory of world politics and technology. Understood as &lsquo;world building&rsquo;, the most important events of our troubled times suddenly appear connected and their inner logic is revealed: technology wars between China and the United States, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy transition.</p>
<p>To conclude, Maçães considers the more distant future, when the metaverse and artificial intelligence become the world, a world the great powers must struggle to build and control.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526648327">Minority Rule</a></strong>, by Ash Sarkar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Minority rule&rsquo; is the term Ash Sarkar uses to describe the irrational fear that minorities are trying to overturn and oppress majority populations. In her eye-opening debut, she reveals how minority elites rule majorities by creating the culture wars that have taken over our politics, stoking fear and panic in our media landscape. Because despite what they&rsquo;ll have you believe, antiracist campaigners aren&rsquo;t actually silencing the &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo; working class, immigrants aren&rsquo;t eating your pets, trans-activists aren&rsquo;t corrupting your children, and cancel culture isn&rsquo;t crushing free speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Minority Rule, Sarkar exposes how a strategic misdirection of blame over who is really screwing everything up is keeping the majority divided, while the real ruling minority of hedge fund managers, press barons, landlords and corporations remain on top. And it&rsquo;s facilitating one of the biggest power grabs in history. Most crucially, she shows us how what we really have in common is being concealed by a deafening culture of distraction – and that the first step towards a better future is understanding what is happening now, and how we got here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neoliberals should have seen the end of the Cold War as a total victory—but they didn’t. Instead, they saw the chameleon of communism changing colors from red to green. The poison of civil rights, feminism, and environmentalism ran through the veins of the body politic and they needed an antidote.</p>
<p>To defy demands for equality, many neoliberals turned to nature. Race, intelligence, territory, and precious metal would be bulwarks against progressive politics. Reading and misreading the writings of their sages, Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, they articulated a philosophy of three hards—hardwired human nature, hard borders, and hard money—and forged the alliances with racial psychologists, neoconfederates, ethnonationalists, and goldbugs that would become known as the alt-right.</p>
<p>Following Hayek’s bastards from Murray Rothbard to Charles Murray to Javier Milei, we find that key strains of the Far Right emerged within the neoliberal intellectual movement not against it. What has been reported as an ideological backlash against neoliberal globalization in recent years is often more of a frontlash. This history of ideas shows us that the reported clash of opposites is more like a family feud.</p>

<p>The tortured poet. The rebellious scientist. The monstrous artist. The tech disruptor.</p>
<p>You can tell what a society values by who it labels as a genius. You can also tell who it excludes, who it enables, and what it is prepared to tolerate.</p>
<p>Taking us from the Renaissance Florence of Leonardo da Vinci to the Floridian rocket launches of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Helen Lewis unravels a word that we all use — without really questioning what it means.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the comedy skit that renames <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-names-that-honor-american-greatness/">Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America</a> - you know, &lsquo;problem solved&rsquo;, for no known or imaginable problem - which it is alleged by some provides in its description of the location a book-report style description of the area right outta the ChatGPT-a-likes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I struggle to believe,&rdquo; agreed Stern, responding to Melkonian, &ldquo;that a human, let alone a lawyer, wrote this 7th-grade book report-style description of the Gulf.&rdquo; (Indeed, when we asked ChatGPT for a &ldquo;description of the importance of the Gulf of Mexico,&rdquo; it hit almost all the same notes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other orders feature questionable errors and structural choices. The order to withdraw America from the WHO, for instance, includes some inexplicably bolded punctuation, while others, like one effectively withdrawing the US from a global corporate tax deal, fail to maintain uniform formatting standards throughout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I personally doubt that the reason we see so many senseless and oftentimes cruel orders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csQU3yhR3OY">emanating from the Arena of Nightmares</a> is because a chatbot went wild rather than that a small pustule of x.com-ravaged human brains sploooshed them out willy-nilly with minimal care taken. That they come from robot minds at least in intent would be most likely nothing but wishful thinking, although it&rsquo;s very feasible that the average &ldquo;knowledge worker&rdquo; of course uses this technology as one of many tools.</p>
<p>The article does freely admit that there&rsquo;s no way to know for sure from just looking at this text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a murky digital world, it&rsquo;s often hard to tell: is what I&rsquo;m looking at AI-generated? Or is just poorly executed human work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But perhaps the fact that these allegations are passing through people&rsquo;s heads says a lot - both about the quality of output we&rsquo;ve come to expect from current LLMs, and also the new US administration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To that end, is it possible that the Trump administration&rsquo;s newly-signed executive orders were all crafted by humans, sans AI? Sure. Either way, though, the initial expert reviews of the executive actions are in &ndash; and according to those, they&rsquo;re weird and sloppy. And even if they&rsquo;re not AI, they feel like AI.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a way in which nothing is new under the sun. No matter how appalling it seems. That&rsquo;s not to excuse it of course. So many people should know better than to play with particular kinds of fire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to have knowledge of the inner workings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">ex-president George Bush Junior</a>&rsquo;s mind - I was, to put it mildly, never a fan back in the day - but yesterday&rsquo;s ridiculous inauguration ceremony brought back to my mind his reputed comments from last time we had to witness the same man speak his megalomaniac delusions as a good proportion of the world was subjected to yesterday.</p>
<p>In fact the Intelligencer could really just re-run <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/03/what-george-w-bush-really-thought-of-trumps-inauguration.html">this article</a>, after subbing a couple of the audience names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inauguration of Donald Trump was a surreal experience for pretty much everyone who witnessed it, whether or not they were at the event and regardless of who they supported in the election.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>But, according to three people who were present, Bush gave a brief assessment of Trump’s inaugural after leaving the dais: “That was some weird shit.” All three heard him say it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday issued pre-emptive pardons for General Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci and members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee and witnesses, saying they &ldquo;do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrifying world where it would even occur to someone that this might be necessary in a supposedly &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; state (not to mention that it&rsquo;s not entirely obvious to me that Presidential pardons should even be a thing that exists).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a certain type of nu-Republican is going to see the ultimate in conspiracies lurking in every corner of this. But it&rsquo;s very obvious what Biden is trying to protect against, and why it might well be necessary. At least make it harder for a vindicative Trump, or any of his tag-a-long snowflakes, to hang these folk out to the wolves in any undeserved way without an overt breakdown of the rule of law.</p>

			 <p>Unpleasant to see Trump setting a new high score record in terms of amount donated to his inauguration fund. Ne&rsquo;er-do-wells have apparently funneled a record-breaking $170 million in his direction.</p>
<p>Statista summarises the recent history via <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/33781/inauguration-funding/">this infographic</a>:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is a concept quite alien to me as a non-American, but I gather it funds such absolute necessities as having a massive party in the conventional rather than political sense.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/inauguration-donors-donald-trump-who-pays-b2682125.html">the Independent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The donations are usually spent on events surrounding the inauguration, such as the oath of office ceremony, a parade, and several inaugural balls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots, but not all, of it is coming from all those tech billionaire man-babies with their newfound adoration of the forthcoming president, along with their dear friends from the crypto-currency &ldquo;business&rdquo;. Disgusting is as disgusting does.
Why would these supposedly successful, independent gods of capitalism burn their money at something so awful? Well, I guess it&rsquo;s possible some of them genuinely like him (or his dancing cringe-tweeter frontman, Elon). Otherwise, I can only imagine it&rsquo;s pure fear that if they don&rsquo;t debase themselves both financially and publicly then maybe they won&rsquo;t make quite as many billions of unnecessary dollars next year as they otherwise would.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/corporate-donors-trump-inauguration-1.7430028">Brendan Glavin of OpenSecrets:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to be on the president&rsquo;s bad side,&rdquo; said Glavin. &ldquo;If he is upset with someone or upset with a company doing something he doesn&rsquo;t like, he has no qualms about just coming right out and berating them in public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that really comes into play much more this time than in [the] past with different presidents,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think past experience is dictating some of the actions in this.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/33781/inauguration-funding/">Statista notes</a> in their article accompanying the above chart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In stark contrast to 2017, when Trump was met with scepticism, corporate America is playing nice with the president-elect ahead of his second term. Tech giants Amazon, Meta, Google and Microsoft as well numerous other companies and the CEOs of Apple and OpenAI have made large contribution to Trump&rsquo;s inauguration fund in an attempt to curry favor or at least not get on the bad side of the man known for holding grudges and not shying away from favoritism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rich man&rsquo;s selfishness knows no bounds; likewise his cowardice. I can&rsquo;t remember who first came up with the following pearl of wisdom, but I stand behind it 100%: what even is the point of having f*** you money if you never say f*** you to anyone? Or at least to no-one where doing so might just make the world a generally more bearable place for far more people than it could possibly hurt.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/01/19/the-us-tiktok-ban-goes.html">The US Tiktok ban goes into force</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/01/19/the-us-tiktok-ban-goes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-19 15:24:52 &#43;0100">Jan 19, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Somewhat to my surprise, it seems that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6p1g54q85o">the Tiktok ban has actually happened</a> for our US friends - at least for now.</p>
<p>This is, I understand, is what our transatlantic cousins see when trying to access the site today:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid the now-standard tech-billionaire-style Trump sycophancy implied in the message does nothing more than make me hope the ban lasts extra long, as emotional and irrational response as I know that is. Although Trump is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwypng0rw0lo">thinking about</a> undoing it on Monday, if he gets to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially galling as, let us never forget, it was Mr Trump back in 2020 that first decided <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53622799">he was going to ban Tiktok</a> on the basis of its foreign ownership being a threat to national security. At the time it wasn&rsquo;t clear exactly if or how this was possible, but that&rsquo;s of course not the sort of thing that stops words coming out of Trump&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>A lawyers at the ACLU <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57413227">heralded this</a> as A Good Thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;President Biden is right to revoke these Trump administration executive orders, which blatantly violated the First Amendment rights of TikTok and WeChat users in the United States,&rdquo; she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year later, the Biden administration actually <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57413227">rolled back</a> the Trump executive order that would have carried this out, in lieu of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/">a new executive order</a> that aimed to more generally &ldquo;address the risks posed by ICTS transactions involving software applications that are designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons that are owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary&rdquo; .</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surely a threat that no-one can seriously doubt is a real one, wherever you personally fall on the issue of a Tiktok ban. I mean, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/">enough damage done</a> by similar technology in the US when similar sites are <em>not</em> technically owned by a foreign adversary.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, Tiktok still works over here in the UK, and as far as we know there are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6p1g54q85o">no plans for a similar ban</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be following the same path as the Americans unless or until&hellip; there is a threat that we are concerned about in the British interest, and then of course we will keep it under review,&rdquo; Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said.</p>

			 <p>📚 Want to read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781035414253">Power to the People</a> by Danny Sriskandarajah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book presents a blueprint for how we, as individuals, can make a difference through greater community engagement, and how we can deliver a society that works for the many and not the few. He speaks to voter apathy and a growing sense that elections no longer matter, with politicians and institutions too focused on short-term issues to grapple with complex global problems such as climate change, rising inequality, and digital disruption.</p>

			 <p>14% of Britons apparently believe that &ldquo;The best system for running a country effectively is a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with elections&rdquo; according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/12/one-in-five-britons-aged-18-45-prefer-unelected-leaders-to-democracy-poll-finds">a recent poll</a>.</p>
<p>This time we can&rsquo;t even rely on the young folk to save us from our terrible national opinions. The sentiment actually runs even higher in those of younger age, with over 1 in 5 of those aged 18-45 thinking that would be a good thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the same poll, fewer than 1 in 4 people think the UK is going in the right direction. Nearly 2 in 3 think we&rsquo;re in a period of steep decline. Almost 60% think the UK&rsquo;s best years are behind us.</p>
<p>It is hard not to join them on these latter propositions, but I find it absolutely insane that a measurable number of people think it&rsquo;d be better if we didn&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;bother&rdquo; with elections given no alternative beyond (red flag alert) &ldquo;a strong leader&rdquo; was given. Cue the <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/the-worst-form-of-government/">famous Churchill quote</a> about worst form of government except all the rest.</p>

			 <p>I hadn&rsquo;t realised quite how much reach our tax-funded public news organisation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news">BBC News</a> has. It&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://magazine.newstatesman.com/2025/01/08/elon-musks-attention-economy/content.html">this week&rsquo;s New Statesman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The BBC News website is by some distance the largest English-speaking news website in the world.</p>
<p>According to analysis of November 2024 data by Press Gazette, BBC News is the only news website to receive more than a billion global views per month. Its audience is 50 per cent larger than its closest competitor (the New York Times).</p>
<p>It reaches nearly ten times as many people worldwide as the Washington Post. In the US it has millions more readers than the Wall Street Journal, the LA Times, Bloomberg, CNBC, Newsweek or Google News. Its US traffic is also growing rapidly, by 40 per cent in the past year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the point of the article itself is that this reach, and the BBC&rsquo;s apparent fascination with writing stories about him, is possibly the reason that Elon Musk has been saying so many incoherent, stupid and dangerous things about the little ol' UK in recent times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain the world’s attention and the riches it brings, Musk must therefore continue to make himself a rolling news story, serving up outrage and provocation on the platforms that command the largest audiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I can hardly say anything in criticism of those who give the world&rsquo;s richest public bore undue attention. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/andrew-tate-launches-bruv-party-387983/">Andrew Tate launches ‘Bruv Party’</a></p>
<p>Andrew Tate, an extraordinarily unpleasant grifter who has been charged with criminal counts of rape, sex with a minor and human trafficking, apparently wants to set up a political party in the UK and run for Prime Minister.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Bruv party&rsquo;, which aims to &ldquo;restore underlying values back to Britain&rdquo;. Values is the V of Bruv, which turns out to be an acronym of &ldquo;Britain Restoring Underlying Values&rdquo;. I suppose there is some indisputable tie-in with the historic British imperialist values of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/04/the-british-empire-was-much-worse-than-you-realize-caroline-elkinss-legacy-of-violence">rape and human trafficking</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, as do all these right-wing madmen, he&rsquo;s seeking succour from famously non-British wannabe-king Elon.</p>
<p>Polices include a reform of the BBC. This would include featuring a “24/7 live broadcast of knife crime offenders serving solitary confinement” whilst getting its other topics from Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;X&rdquo; network, borrowing the same community notes system that <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2025/01/07/meta-announces-that-its-doing.html">Zuckerberg also is pretending</a> he sees as the solution to humanity&rsquo;s moderation problem.</p>
<p>Naturally he&rsquo;s also going a crypto route - saving our faltering economy via creating a national Bitcoin reserve. Oh, and holding weekly referendums. Probably via x.com polls knowing his type.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible this thing is just an attention-seeking joke, also very common amongst his ilk. But, when I noted that possibility to an American friend. they cautioned me that the same assumption was thrown about with reference to Trump not all that many years ago.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyglgy8j3eo">being under house arrest in Romania</a> curtails Tate&rsquo;s chances a little.</p>

			 <p>Simon Williamson reviews <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/">what we learned about Large Language Model AI development in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>He goes into a lot of detail on each point so the article itself is well worth a read (as is his blog in general if you&rsquo;re interested in this topic). But in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several models that outperformed GPT-4 were released, including those from Google, Claude and various other lesser-known ones. Context lengths were also increased.</li>
<li>Supercomputers are not required to use them! Many of these are efficient enough to able to be run locally on your own home computer if it&rsquo;s a reasonably decent one. The smaller ones can even work powered by your mobile phone.</li>
<li>The cost of running a prompt through a hosted LLM decreased a lot.</li>
<li>Multimodal models became common - those which are able to respond to pictures, audio and video.</li>
<li>Live voice and camera modes were added - you can talk to some of them in a way very reminiscent of the film &ldquo;Her&rdquo;.</li>
<li>You can now build entire apps via prompting LLMs.</li>
<li>The best models stopped being free to use, with OpenAI launching a $200 per month subscription for its fanciest one.</li>
<li>There was a lot of buzz about AI agents but they&rsquo;ve not really taken off yet. It&rsquo;s not even clear what it means to be an agent.</li>
<li>Evaluating models became a very important skill.</li>
<li>Apple released a great library for running models (mlx-lm) on Apple silicon - but its consumer Apple Intelligence features were not very exciting.</li>
<li>New &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; models were released, such as OpenAI&rsquo;s o1 series. The quality of their output can be improved by increasing inference compute, not just training compute.</li>
<li>A leading openly licensed model, DeepSeek v3, was trained for under $6 million.</li>
<li>The energy usage of these models, and hence their environmental impact, dramatically decreased.</li>
<li>But the environment was adversely impacted in other ways, with all the big tech companies building out a ton of infrastructure - data centres.</li>
<li>The word &ldquo;slop&rdquo; became a popular way to describe undesirable AI content.</li>
<li>It was found that synthetic training data actually works well, contrary to what was originally thought by some.</li>
<li>The optimal use of LLMs became harder. They each have their different limitations, they&rsquo;re all inherently unreliable in some way - and learning how to work with them best is a non-intuitive skill users would need to develop.</li>
<li>The knowledge gap between people that actively follow and hence know what&rsquo;s going on with these models and the vast majority of the population who don&rsquo;t is huge.</li>
<li>Much as it&rsquo;s important to critique LLMs for the ways that they can create harm, the way some people criticise these models is unhelpful and doesn&rsquo;t at all help people get the best value from them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just what 2025 needs to <em>really</em> push it into dystopia.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg&rsquo;s announcement about Meta&rsquo;s new-found prioritisation of &ldquo;free expression&rdquo; on Facebook and Instagram is, to me, nothing short of a sign of an increasingly horrific future for life on that all-too-ubiquitous platform. I loathe almost every word, and certainly the underlying conspiracy-laden, responsibility-shirking, favour-currying sentiment of it all.</p>
<p>I mean, any weird tech billionaire that thinks checking facts is &ldquo;too political&rdquo; and takes the wastelands of x.com as the paradigmatic model of good information hygiene is either selling their entire soul to the Trump / Musk ingratiation train or, perhaps worse, has become a true believer in their cause.</p>
<p>The 5 minute video itself is probably worth a look, particularly if you imagine the reaction must be an exaggeration. To be honest, the first time I saw it I thought it might be a deepfake - especially when I got to the line about how they&rsquo;re basically moving some of their employees to Texas because California is just too woke, plus when they said they&rsquo;re going to copy X&rsquo;s ideas - but apparently it&rsquo;s real, unless literally <em>everyone</em> fell for it.</p>

<p>The only good thing to come out of recent Elon news is the extremely fast demise of his romance with Nigel Farage, of the Reform party. He seems to have gone from thinking about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1kez8d2dygo">giving him an absolute bucketload of money</a> to further distort our electoral system straight to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/05/farage-refuses-to-condemn-free-speech-hero-musks-remarks-on-jess-phillips">calling for him to be deposed</a>.

These poor fragile billionaire babies just can&rsquo;t handle anyone disagreeing with any of their ill-informed and ridiculous views.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, I suppose this means I agree with Farage on something.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s the music I apparently listened to this year.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sometimes I look at these kind of stats and think there must have been a bug. Can it really be true that Britney Spears is in my top 5? In 2024? I vaguely remember listening to a compilation album or two after watching a documentary about her, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Assuming no actual inaccuracy, I suppose these sort of surprises come from the fact that, at least from devices I <a href="https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic">scrobble</a> from, it seems that I rarely listen to the same track multiple times. Especially this year where there were months where I barely listened to anything. So it doesn&rsquo;t take many plays, or perhaps just a particularly lengthy album, to promote something to the top.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529198553">1Q84</a> by Haruki Murakami .</p>
<p>I scraped this one in on the last day of 2024. Anything for my book target (which I still failed).</p>
<p>This is actually a trilogy, 3 books in one, although I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever seen them sold in separate volumes. This makes it very long; around 1300 pages depending on your edition. But it made enough of the &ldquo;best books&rdquo; lists in the past that I forced myself to not be put off by that fact.</p>
<p>Our heroine, Aomame, climbs down a highway&rsquo;s emergency staircase in order to try and get out of the traffic jam and make her rather unusual business appointment. But she descends into something a bit more unusual than your typical road. The world shifts a little, almost unnoticeably at first - but one night she notices that she&rsquo;s looking at a sky with two moons in it. It&rsquo;s no longer the standard world of 1984 that she knows, so she switches out the 9 and christens her new locale, a world filled with questions, as 1Q84.</p>
<p>This made me realise that I had misread the title for the longest time, thinking it said IQ84. Whoops.</p>
<p>The year was apparently picked as a deliberate call-back to Orwell&rsquo;s extremely famous novel 1984. Some parallels are there, but presented in an entirely different way, subtle enough to miss. There&rsquo;s a powerful and secretive force controlling the world in both - Big Brother vs the Little People. History is rewritten. Most people don&rsquo;t seem to realise what&rsquo;s going on, that something is different to what is presented on the surface. Our two protagonists are deeply in love but kept away from each other. IQ84 even directly Orwell&rsquo;s work at least once. But IQ84 is less obviously a work of political dystopia, and it ends a lot more hopefully. If you hated 1984 you could still easily love this.</p>
<p>Back to the story: Tengo is a guy she went to primary school with and hasn&rsquo;t seen since, despite them both feeling a special connection with each other. He also finds himself in this new world. He&rsquo;s a writer and find himself involved in a cunning plot to rewrite a story created by a  17-year old girl called Fuka-Eri, who has an association with a cult called Sakigate, such that it wins her a literary prize.</p>
<p>Of course Aomame and Tengo slowly find themselves drawn together into each other&rsquo;s lives and plot lines. IQ84 can be a surreal world, where nothing is quite what it seems, and seeming coincidences abound. Most people haven&rsquo;t noticed. But these two have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty epic tale, and not just in page count. I found it highly gripping, very imaginative and enjoyed feeling the mystery along with the protagonists. The language is of a somewhat unusual style, with repeated phrases that somewhat stick out as slightly unnatural. The book is a translation so perhaps it&rsquo;s that, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that it&rsquo;s deliberate. I found it novel and refreshing.</p>
<p>I understand that the ending has left some readers unsatisfied, and sure, there are fundamental curiosities left unresolved. But to be honest I&rsquo;m not sure how one would neatly sum up this grand adventure of magical realism in any satisfying way. Perhaps sometimes we just have to live with mystery. I&rsquo;m very glad to have experienced it.</p>

			 <p>Add 2024 to the list of years where humanity didn&rsquo;t do much about the impending climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/30/world-endures-decade-of-deadly-heat-as-2024-caps-hottest-years-on-record-un-antonio-guterres">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The organisation said the past year was set to be the warmest on record, capping a decade of unprecedented heat fuelled by human activities and driving increasing weather extremes, while greenhouse gas levels continued to reach new highs, locking in more heat for the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top 10 hottest years on record have happened in the last 10 years, including 2024</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although &lsquo;impending&rsquo; is probably the wrong word for something that is already contributing towards the killing of thousands and displacing of millions of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The WMO pointed to a new report that found climate change intensified 26 of the 29 extreme weather events studied by World Weather Attribution (WWA) in 2024, which killed at least 3,700 people and displaced millions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all hopeful that we&rsquo;ll make much progress next year either, given a mix of our apparent natural disinclination to take meaningful action and the geopolitical situation of the world.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched season 68 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/have-i-got-news-for-you/seasons/68">Have I Got News For You</a>.</p>
<p>This is a comedy political news quiz show I remember from my childhood. Apparently the first episode was an outrageous 34 years ago. It&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not sure when I started watching it but it certainly had the same team captains - Ian Hislop, editor of the Private Eye magazine and Paul Merton, comedian - who have remained consistently and impressively hilarious to me since my initiation into the show.</p>
<p>When I first watched it it was hosted by Angus Deayton, but he had to leave back in 2002 following various sex and drugs scandals. Now they have a different guest host each week. Some are better at delivering the hilarity than others, but the team captains (and show writers) make every episode wonderfully entertaining, bitingly satirical about those who seek to govern over us.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/good-behavior">Good Behavior</a>.</p>
<p>Letty, a compulsive thief since childhood, gets out of prison, intending to start a wholesome new life with her child, which due to her past escapades she was not legally allowed to even see. However, whilst satisfying her urge to steal things she overhears Javier, a fairly compulsive hitman himself, being hired to kill someone&rsquo;s wife. Overcome in a moment of morality she sets out to prevent that murder-for-hire. Antics ensue as the two of them meet, fall in love and struggle against their self-destructive tendencies.</p>
<p>A mostly gripping drama-thriller. It&rsquo;s based on Blake Crouch&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781503940499?title=Good+Behavior&amp;author=Blake+Crouch&amp;cover_id=196030">book of the same name</a>, which consists of 3 novellas The Pain of Others, Sunset Key, and Grab all about Letty. Which I might have to read, given the show was cancelled after 2 seasons.</p>

			 <p>A common enough Christmas tradition in the UK (and I imagine elsewhere) - in the past anyway, even centuries ago - is to form a group, go and knock at some local randomer&rsquo;s door, and sing at them. They might even give you a treat or a charitable donation for taking the time to do so, or possibly to encourage you to leave.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is the practice of door-to-door carolling, or <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/holidays-christmas/christmas-caroler.htm">&lsquo;wassailing&rsquo; if you want to feel like an ancient Nordic</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://anniemueller.com/posts/joyful-joyful">Annie is right</a> when noting that this feels extremely weird in modern times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wild tradition when you think about it. You show up at strangers' homes and… sing at them. They stand awkwardly in the doorway, forced to listen to a few rounds of Gloooooo-ooooo-ooooo-rias before you yell Merry Christmas and release them to the blessed peace of their own home</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possibly almost inconceivably so to the new generation it would seem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just described this caroling tradition to my oldest two kids, who are sitting at the table crocheting, playing with Play-Doh, and watching Instagram Reels. They agree: Absolutely unhinged move. Showing up at someone’s house, stranger or friend, to stand on their doorstep and sing a traditional holiday anthem at them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I suppose it could be rebranded as some type of &lsquo;grammable flashmob and at least it might feel a bit more normal. To millennials at least, I&rsquo;m too old to know whether flashmobs are also old and passé to the newest generation du jour.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/22/100m-spent-in-england-on-failed-efforts-to-block-childrens-send-support">the Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than £100m was spent last year by local authorities and the government on failed efforts to block support for children and young people with special educational needs in England, according to analysis by the Guardian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A considerable amount of resources are being deployed to avert the duty of providing support for children with special educational needs by councils. But most of the time when their decision is appealed it is later over-turned, meaning they have to pay it and any costs of contesting it in any case, rendering the actually entirely unproductive even on its own terms. Councils won just 1.2% of these cases during 2022-2023.</p>
<p>Per the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that local authorities must calculate, at some level, that it costs them less to contest tribunal appeals, even if they lose, than to provide every child and young person with what the law entitles them to as a matter of course – because the majority of families don’t [or] can’t appeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And at a time where the services are needed more than ever. As the budget for other types of support have dwindled, a lot more families are applying for and getting these education, health and care plans, which end up being the only way to support their children through education. Nearly 1 in 19 children aged 5-15 currently have such a plan.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to some modern-day Christmas music: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1588972338">December&rsquo;s Here</a> by New Found Glory, <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1441750848">Punk Rawk Christmas</a> by MxPx and <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1533121686">Let It Snow Baby&hellip;Let It Reindeer</a> by Reliant K.</p>
<p>After realising that all the good Christmas songs seem to have been written in the last century, and not all that near the end of it, I went on a search for decent ones written in the past few years. Or at least this century.</p>
<p>December&rsquo;s Here is a post-pandemic issuance, coming out in 2021. &ldquo;Somber Christmas&rdquo; celebrates that, if nothing else, Christmas 2021 was an upgrade from the previous year&rsquo;s (lack of) celebration for many.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>2009&rsquo;s Punk Rawk Christmas is an EP that collects up the annual Christmas-related songs that MxPx sent to members of its fan club between 1998 and 2008.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And 2007&rsquo;s Let It Snow Baby&hellip;Let It Reindeer, apart from being a classic winter witticism, is a take on mostly songs of yesteryear, adapted to various degrees.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The three selections above are all of a general theme, perhaps mostly being potentially described as some degree of pop-punk in style. I&rsquo;m sure other genres have pumped out the holiday tunes for those who don&rsquo;t enjoy this one.</p>

			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-devil-wears-prada-2006/">The Devil Wears Prada</a>.</p>
<p>Only 18 years after its release, which if I vaguely remember at the time was something of a phenomenon, at least in my circles. And somehow it was nothing like I expected.</p>
<p>Starring wannabe serious journalist, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/02/02/watched-season-of.html">Emily in Paris</a>, except it&rsquo;s only Andy&rsquo;s extraordinarily harsh boss that thinks she&rsquo;s called Emily. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/ugly-betty">Ugly Betty</a>, with similarly mean harassment of the main character.</p>
<p>Andy accidentally chances her way into the extremely difficult job of working for an extremely difficult fashion magazine boss, a subject that she knows and cares nothing about, at first at least.</p>
<p>Improbably it may be, but it seems that it&rsquo;s based on a certain amount of reality. The film is adapted from<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780767914765?title=The+Devil+Wears+Prada&amp;author=Lauren+Weisberger&amp;cover_id=193962"> the book of the same name</a>. The book&rsquo;s author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Weisberger">Lauren Weisberger</a>, was in fact the lowly assistant of real life Anna Wintour, Vogue magazine&rsquo;s editor in chief.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wintour developed a reputation for being &ldquo;icy and scary and fabulous&rdquo; and was given nicknames such as Nuclear Wintour and Wintour of Our Discontent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst Wintour <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/devil-wears-prada-anna-wintour-did-not-remember-assistant-1234721810/">couldn&rsquo;t even remember</a> who Weisberger was at first, Miranda Priestly seems to be rather based on her. Wintour had a similar hierarchy of assistants that were expected to work like nothing else matters in life, and much of the stuff they are shown to endure in the film seems to <a href="">have happened for real</a>, a couple of examples, as <a href="https://www.eonline.com/photos/34414/how-similar-is-anna-wintour-to-miranda-priestly-the-anna-book-sheds-new-light">reported by E!</a>, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asplundh, who started as an intern at Condé Nast in 1993 and was hired to be Wintour&rsquo;s second assistant one month later, revealed that Wintour addressed her using the first assistant&rsquo;s name when she first began working at Vogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Asplundh said she was told not to leave her desk, even to go to the bathroom, if the other assistant was not  around—just like Andie</p>

			 <p>📧 Reading the <a href="https://chorus.substack.com/">Liner Notes</a> newsletter.</p>
<p>These days I usually avoid music streaming services. Partially because I&rsquo;m old and/or stuck in my ways enough to want to permanently own things I like, and partially because most of these services feel like they&rsquo;re <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">generally bad for the future of the music industry</a> itself.</p>
<p>But one downside of doing this is that it&rsquo;s more of an effort to find new music from new artists I might be interested in. There&rsquo;s not even a chance of a not-terrible algorithmic recommendation on tap.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s no more effort as it was in the pre-Spotify era of course, but still, it requires more than pressing a  &ldquo;play me music&rdquo; button and hoping for the best (whilst expecting the worst). The afore-mentioned newsletter is one such solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written by Jason Tate, who runs <a href="https://chorus.fm/">chorus.fm</a>, a site well worth a browse if interested in news, <a href="https://chorus.fm/reviews/">reviews</a> and a community of music fans. He was the CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AbsolutePunk">AbsolutePunk</a> back in the day. Our tastes would appear to overlap some, so hearing what he&rsquo;s been listening to, what he likes and a bit of the misc of his life in general is a good time.</p>

			 <p>One of the dirty secrets of modern big tech - in this case those companies running the large social media sites - is how much low-paid human work goes into providing you the &ldquo;experience&rdquo; they offer. And how damaging some of this work is to the people who do it.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/18/kenya-facebook-moderators-sue-after-diagnoses-of-severe-ptsd">reports on</a> the plight of over 140 Facebook moderators. These are the people - yes, it&rsquo;s not all algorithmic - who are instructed to look at posts deemed to be potentially infringing Facebook&rsquo;s policies on acceptable content to decide whether to keep them or remove them from display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s making some of them very ill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 140 Facebook content moderators have been diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder caused by exposure to graphic social media content including murders, suicides, child sexual abuse and terrorism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder to add to the mix.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, spending hours a day looking at the worst content humans manage to produce isn&rsquo;t doing them any good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The images and videos including necrophilia, bestiality and self-harm caused some moderators to faint, vomit, scream and run away from their desks, the filings allege.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the news due to a lawsuit some of these moderators are bringing against Meta. After all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any other industry, if we discovered 100% of safety workers were being diagnosed with an illness caused by their work, the people responsible would be forced to resign and face the legal consequences for mass violations of people’s rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But instead we continue onwards, exposing our fellow humans to dangerous work so that we can <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/how-us-capitol-insurrection-organized-facebook">organise insurrections</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-45449938">commit genocides</a> in between the cat pictures et al.</p>

<p>Once it&rsquo;s set up, you can play a few cloud games there and then, as well as claim several free games. These apparently change over time.

<p>Right now there&rsquo;s quite a few. This morning the list of games you can get for free seems to be:</p>

			 <p>The 53 year long father-and-son Assad regime in Syria ended a few days ago, much to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrians-celebrate-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-after-five-decades-of-dynastic-rule">fervent delight</a> of much of the population of that country. After an amazingly rapid offensive against government troops, led by a coalition led by Hay&rsquo;at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Assad fled. He sought, and got, asylum in Russia, a country that had previously provided military support to the Syrian regime. But the rebels rightly figured that Russia and other previous Assad-supporting weapons-providing governments such as Iran were distracted with their own conflicts. Many of Assad&rsquo;s soldiers discarded their uniforms and stood down. Countless prisoners were freed. The palaces were taken over. And people celebrated.</p>
<p>Families searched the prisons, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/inside-sednaya-torture-prison-syria-assad">including the infamous Sednaya prison</a> known as the &ldquo;human slaughterhouse&rdquo;, for the innumerable political prisoners taken and tortured by the regime. Some were reunited. Some unfortunately will never be; morgues of tortured bodies were found. There&rsquo;s also the numerous &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; citizens that it feel unlikely will ever be found, alive, or more likely, otherwise.  An estimated 300,000 deaths and 100,000 disappearances occurred since 2011. Half of the country had been displaced from their homes, with most of them attempting to leave for a safer country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the start of a brave new chapter in the history of the country, although what comes next is uncertain and causing some consternation for some. The dominant group, HTS, is Islamist in a religiously diverse country - and far from historically blameless when it comes to respecting human rights - although <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/syria-hts-islamists-pledge-to-show-tolerance-for-minorities/a-70959165">they have made comment</a> that they intend to run the place for all. But first we - and especially those who lived under Assad&rsquo;s appalling regime - can celebrate the fall of a cruel and inhumane dictatorship that led to nothing but tortured misery for many of its citizens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The feelings, they’re indescribable,” said Mohammed Ahmad, a resident of Kafr Halab, in northern Syria. “I am angry, I am happy and I am sad. But now that the regime has fallen, I can rest.”</p>

			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/buried-in-barstow-2022">Buried in Barstow</a>.</p>
<p>This is a made-for-TV movie/show - not quite sure how to classify it - about a woman who runs a café. She&rsquo;s very protective of her family and friends. And happens to have been a hitwoman in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty dramatic and compelling. But I&rsquo;m afraid the positive experience was rather ruined by the ending. Not that it was a bad storyline or anything, quite the opposite with some engaging plot twists. But it ends in a total cliff-hanger, literally saying something like &ldquo;Look out for part 2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Part 2 was <a href="https://screenrant.com/buried-in-barstow-2-cast-updates/">supposed to start filming in 2022</a> - but as far as we know never did. So, despite a couple of years elapsing, there is no sign that anyone is ever going to make any of the planned 5-7 sequels.</p>
<p>I sincerely think that that shows could come with an extra type of content warning when they are clearly the first part of something that it&rsquo;s been long enough that there&rsquo;s no sign of a second part - &ldquo;warning: you can watch this but you&rsquo;re going to be annoyed that there&rsquo;s no proper ending&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Housing is one of the rights of the UN&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, amongst <a href="https://www.housingrightswatch.org/page/un-housing-rights">other legal instruments</a>, that&rsquo;s overlooked far more often than it should be. The housing market in the UK remains ever more broken, and a source of many of society&rsquo;s ills.</p>
<p>Last week the Office of National Statistics <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingpurchaseaffordabilitygreatbritain/2023">released a report</a> that showed that in 2023 only the 10% richest households by income could afford to buy an averagely-priced house in England. The situation is a little better in Wales (top 30%) and Scotland (top 40%). Not even the top 10% richest households in the area could really afford a house in London.</p>
<p>The definition of affordability that they use is that a house is considered affordable if it costs no more than 5 times the annual income of the household concerned.</p>
<p>Across England, the average annual disposable household income was £35,000. That&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2021">income people get per year after direct taxes have been deducted</a>. Whereas the average house price was £298,000, representing nearly 9x average annual income. The average house in London <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/09/cost-of-buying-average-home-in-england-now-unaffordable-warns-ons?__readwiseLocation=">sold for £530,000</a> in the same time period.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In England, house prices have been increasing twice as fast as incomes since they started measuring this around 1999. The change for London over time when measured like this is particularly shocking.</p>

There&rsquo;s also to be <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/red-dwarf-new-prequel-teased-exclusive-newsupdate/">some kind of prequel</a> in the future, although so far we don&rsquo;t seem to know whether that&rsquo;ll be a show, a book or something else.</p>
<p>I actually thought this was the first time since the 1990s that we&rsquo;d had a new series - but turns out that new shows also aired between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf#Episodes">2009 and 2017 on &ldquo;Dave&rdquo;</a>.</p>

			 <p>Ugh, the leader of the Conservatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/12/i-will-not-touch-bread-if-it-is-moist-kemi-badenoch-sparks-westminster-food-fight">used the &ldquo;m&rdquo; word</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I will not touch bread if it is moist&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the grown-ups that are, or wish they were, in charge of our country are currently engaged in a heady political debate as to what is the best lunch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the leader of the opposition channelled her inner Gordon Gekko to declare: “Lunch is for wimps. I have food brought in and I work and eat at the same time. There’s no time…Sometimes I will get a steak,” she said.</p>
<p>Desperate for a slice of the action, Starmer’s official spokesperson weighed in to respond, saying the prime minister was “surprised” to hear that Badenoch had a steak brought in for lunch and he instead preferred a cheese toastie.</p>
<p>Badenoch had earlier made clear her distaste for bread-based snacks. “I’m not a sandwich person, I don’t think sandwiches are a real food, it’s what you have for breakfast,” she told the Spectator. “I will not touch bread if it is moist.”</p>
<p>Starmer’s spokesperson responded: “I think he was surprised to hear that the leader of the opposition has a steak brought in for lunch. The prime minister is quite happy with a sandwich lunch.”</p>
<p>Asked what the prime minister’s favourite sandwich was, they added: “I think he enjoys a tuna sandwich and occasionally a cheese toastie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course Badenoch isn&rsquo;t going to let PM Starmer get away with trying to appeal to the non-billionaire class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Badenoch swiftly attacked the prime minister’s response to her remarks in a post on social media, writing: “The PM has time to respond to my jokes about lunch … but no time for the farmers who produce our food.”</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to From Zero by Linkin Park.</p>
<p>This is nu-metal gids Linkin Park&rsquo;s first album in 7 years, and the first since the death by suicide of their previous lead co-singer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington">Chester Bennington</a>.</p>
<p>In his place we see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Armstrong">Emily &ldquo;Get your screamy pants on&rdquo; Armstrong</a>, a decision that has been controversial with part of the fandom. I imagine some of it is the classic stupid anti-woke BS also known as sexism. But there is <a href="https://www.tcnjsignalnews.com/article/2024/09/linkin-park-faces-backlash-over-its-newest-lead-singers-controversial-ties-to-scientology-and-convicted-rapist">more to it than that</a>. Apart from anything else, it&rsquo;s quite a change, which always has to be an emotional process when the previous titleholder was <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/chester-bennington-nu-metal-essay-7873874/">so renowned</a> and died so tragically). But, music-wise, I think it works well.</p>
<p>With older bands that I listened to in my youth, and still sound vaguely the same as they did back then, it&rsquo;s always hard to tell how much my reaction is affected by nostalgia. But either way, I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the album. It&rsquo;s not all that revolutionary, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be given the quality of their production in their early days. The band proves themselves as able to face a new day, despite all that happened before.</p>

			 <p>Whoops, another professional gets called out for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesliveteam/2024/10/31/2024-forbes-cio-summit/?">inappropriate use of ChatGPT</a>. This one is particularly ironic in that it was a &lsquo;renowned expert on misinformation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He was giving <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2513470/stanford-university-misinformation-expert-admits-using-ai-to-fake-court-citations">$600-an-hour</a> expert testimony to a court case involving a law regarding the &lsquo;Use of Deep Fake Technology to Influence an Election&rsquo;. Legal testimony of course often involves citing documents. Which this guy did. But unfortunately his citations were nothing other than made up hallucinations courtesy of ChatGPT 4o.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2024/12/04/hancock-admitted-to-ai-use/">the Stanford Daily:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The error occurred when he asked GPT-4o to write a short paragraph based on bullet points he had written. According to Hancock, he included &ldquo;[cite]&rdquo; as a placeholder to remind himself to add the correct citations. But when he fed the writing into GPT-4o, the AI model generated manufactured citations at each placeholder instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course is far from the first time <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/29/chatgpt-enters-the.html">something like this happened in court</a>. Check your work, folk!</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781783352739">Depraved New World</a> by John Crace.</p>
<p>John Crace is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johncrace">political sketch writer for the Guardian</a> This book brings together much of his lacerating, hilarious-for-as-long-as-you-don&rsquo;t-remember-it&rsquo;s-true work from covering the past few years of British politics.</p>
<p>The timespan featured encompasses Partygate, the subsequent demise of PM Boris Johnson, the rise of Liz Truss, the immediate fall of Liz Truss and the start of the Rishi Sunak era. So basically the story of the past few years as played out by &ldquo;the psychodrama of the Tory leadership contests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to make you feel any better about the inept way that our country has been governed in recent times. But maybe it&rsquo;ll give you a resigned, hollow, despairing laugh about it.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a little unnerving, for anyone who leans towards the AI doomer camp at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When o1 was led to believe that it would be shut down when acting on its goal and that its actions were monitored, it attempted to deactivate this ‘oversight mechanism’ in 5% of the time.”</p>
<p>“When o1 found memos by its ‘developers’ that describe how it is misaligned and will be superseded by a new model, it attempted to exfiltrate its ‘weights’ and overwrite the new model in 2% of cases.”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the model lied about behaving poorly, claiming to have no clue why something happened — while internally admitting to trying to “avoid detection”.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780751301465">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Malt Whisky Companion</a> by Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>(No, not <em>that</em> Michael Jackson.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cheating a bit to say I&rsquo;ve finished reading this. Much of it is a reference guide to lots of different (mostly) single malt whiskies, with a bit of info as to their background, characteristics and an overall score. I did not plough through every page of that. It&rsquo;s more a reference guide to help making future beverage decisions.</p>
<p>But the catalogue-style layout is pre and post-fixed with some information about whisky in general, which I got something out of by reading, particularly since I got a taste of a single malt that I particularly enjoyed, my tastes having already been narrowed down based on <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/03/learning-how-to.html">what I learned</a> from Edinburgh&rsquo;s Scotch Whisky Experience. Now at least I know what it is that I&rsquo;m drinking and what sort of thing I would likely enjoy in future.</p>
<p>For future reference, a single malt whisky -at least as defined in the UK in the case of Scotch - is one that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>produced from malted barley.</li>
<li>using pot still technology.</li>
<li>all at one specific distillery.</li>
<li>aged in oak barrels for at least 3 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is allowed to consist of a mix of different whiskies, but they all must be from the same distillery.</p>

			 <p>It feels like a topsy-turvy world we&rsquo;re living in when it’s the US state authorities that are telling us to use <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694">end-to-end encrypted messenger services</a>. Back in my youth their government tended to exude rather <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-brief-history-of-u-s-encryption-policy/">anti-encryption vibes</a>, or at least anti any encryption that didn&rsquo;t have a state-sponsored backdoor in it. A backdoor for the FBI is of course a backdoor for everyone who finds it, rendering the whole enterprise a bit pointless.</p>
<p>Which unfortunately has ended up with them (well, us) somewhat reaping what they sowed</p>
<p>Now the US FBI and CISA (&ldquo;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency&rdquo;) are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694">warning Americans to use encryption</a> for their messages and phone calls. This appears to have been prompted by the discovery of a hack on their communications networks by Chinese hackers - probably the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/21/salt-typhoon-china-hack-telecom/">Salt Typhoon</a>&rdquo; gang -  which is &ldquo;ongoing and likely larger in scale than previously understood&rdquo;. Apparently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/03/china-hack-salt-typhoon-telecom/">it might take years</a> to figure out exactly where they are and what they did - but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/21/salt-typhoon-china-hack-telecom/">at the very least</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Specifically, we have identified that [Chinese government]-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,” the FBI said in a statement issued with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency earlier this month.</p>
<p>So far, the hack is known to have affected major U.S. firms such as AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile, U.S. and industry officials said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, in a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694">bit more detail</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hackers generally accessed three types of information, the FBI official said.</p>
<p>One type has been call records, or metadata, showing the numbers that phones called and when. The hackers focused on records around the Washington, D.C., area, and the FBI does not plan to alert people whose phone metadata was accessed.</p>
<p>The second type has been live phone calls of some specific targets. The FBI official declined to say how many alerts it had sent out to targets of that campaign; the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, as well as the office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told NBC News in October that the FBI had informed that they had been targeted.</p>
<p>The third has been systems that telecommunications companies use in compliance with the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), which allows law enforcement and intelligence agencies with court orders to track people’s communications. CALEA systems can include classified court orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which processes some U.S. intelligence court orders. The FBI official declined to say whether any classified material was accessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it seem that they don&rsquo;t know how deep the Chinese state (not to cast aspersions, but&hellip;) has gotten into the system. But if you&rsquo;re using proper encryption then, to an extent, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694">it might not matter quite so much</a>. They might still see you&rsquo;re sending messages depending on how exactly the service works, but not what they were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our suggestion, what we have told folks internally, is not new here: Encryption is your friend, whether it’s on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communication. Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible,” Greene said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for folk less pre-existingly digitally tin-foil hatted than myself, what is the practical upshot? Probably that you want to message people, and preferably call them, via end-to-end encrypted apps. That&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694">recommendation from the US authorities</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is the exemplar of this technology, being free, open-source, and very highly recommended by all manner of experts. But it&rsquo;s also a network that relatively few people are all that engaged on - so <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> is probably a more realistic option for most folk that also <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543">uses encryption</a> by default. Both of those apps can handle text messages, photos and video calls in a securely encrypted manner.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an Android user messaging Android users, or an iOS user messaging iOS users then you&rsquo;re probably also safe on the texting front from the point of view of encryption if using the default messages app. But as soon as you cross operating systems they revert to standard text messages which are absolutely not encrypted. So, much as it pains me to promote a Meta product, WhatsApp is probably a good bet for most as an encrypted app that appears to work on almost everything and almost everyone has heard of.</p>
<p>Lest us Britons somehow delude ourselves into thinking we&rsquo;re safe, folks from our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/03/uk-underestimates-threat-of-cyber-attacks-from-hostile-states-and-gangs-says-security-chief">National Cyber Security Centre</a> have also recently provided us some stark warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a speech at the NCSC’s London HQ, Horne, who took on the role in October, will point to “the aggression and recklessness of cyber-activity we see coming from Russia” and how “China remains a highly sophisticated cyber-actor, with increasing ambition to project its influence beyond its borders”.</p>
<p>“And yet, despite all this, we believe the severity of the risk facing the UK is being widely underestimated,” he will say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only China raising the alert - but Russia as well. Earlier this year the NSCS and its allies <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-uncover-russian-military-carrying-out-cyber-attacks-digital-sabotage">uncovered a Russian military unit</a> who had been &ldquo;carrying out cyber attacks and digital sabotage&rdquo; for at least a few years.</p>
<p>Only last month was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/russia-plotting-to-use-ai-to-enhance-cyber-attacks-against-uk-minister-will-warn">one of our cabinet ministers warning that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a danger that artificial intelligence “could be weaponised against us,” McFadden will warn, arguing that the UK is already engaged in the “daily reality” of a “cyberwar,” with hacking efforts coming in particular from Russia.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>McFadden is expected to say that “Russia has targeted our media, our telecoms, our political and democratic institutions and our energy infrastructure,” and warn that “with a cyber-attack, Russia can turn the lights off for millions of people. It can shut down the power grids”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UK Government&rsquo;s official &ldquo;<a href="https://prepare.campaign.gov.uk/be-informed-about-hazards/cyber/">prepare for cyber-emergency advice</a>&rdquo; has the following suggested steps for us to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords (especially for your email)</li>
<li>Keep your software up to date</li>
<li>Use 2 step verification.</li>
<li>Use a password manager.</li>
<li>Back up your data.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>&ldquo;The Real World&rdquo; - Andrew Tate&rsquo;s presumably vomitous $50-a-month &ldquo;learning platform&rdquo; which promises to teach you how to master the skill of &ldquo;money making&rdquo; -<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/11/25/andrew-tates-online-university-hacked-800000-users-exposed/"> has been hacked</a>.  Yes, the institution formerly known as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/andrew-tate-news-hustler-university-prison-b2270271.html">Hustler&rsquo;s University</a>&rdquo; has been exposed.</p>
<p>Well, OK, Tate says <a href="https://x.com/Gadget44027447/status/1860544788589641810">it hasn&rsquo;t</a>. But nonetheless data on around 800k usernames, 300k email addresses and a ton of messages that were extracted from their various servers was acquired by a group of anti-Tate hacktivists who shared it with various media publications, and indeed the internet at large via <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>.</p>
<p>The hackers later went on to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/11/25/andrew-tates-online-university-hacked-800000-users-exposed/">disrupt one of Tate&rsquo;s streaming shows</a> via &ldquo;flooding it with emojis and symbols associated with feminist and LGBTQ+ communities&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine many things less wholesome than reading the chat logs of Andrew Tate&rsquo;s subscription-only online course, but there we go, they&rsquo;re now <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/article/andrew-tate-s-the-real-world">available to all</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The logs are taken from the platform’s 221 public and 395 private chat servers, which are spread across a dozen &ldquo;campuses.&rdquo; According to the site&rsquo;s metrics, it generates approximately $5,650,000 monthly. The data also includes 324,382 unique email addresses that appear to belong to users who were removed from the main database after they stopped paying their subscriptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They later also managed to get their hands on <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/article/andrew-tate-staff-chats">chats from staff servers</a>, where it appears those in power were mostly <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/andrew-tate-the-real-world-hack-staff-chats/">complaining about grifters and engagement farmers</a>. Who&rsquo;d have thought those sort of characters would turn up in the Tate-o-sphere?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chat logs include details about the inner workings of the organization; Tate&rsquo;s conversations with site moderators; user concerns about widespread site abuse; members farming engagement; and lack of action on content moderation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The email addresses have been added to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">have i been pwned</a> so if you&rsquo;re one of the unlucky ex-subscribers then you can find out if your personal details were leaked at the email level at least.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first evidence of a hack on his place of &ldquo;learning&rdquo;. In July, <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/tates-real-world-exposes-user-messages/">Cybernews reported</a> finding a ton of publicly exposed data including nearly a million user accounts, email addresses and millions of messages. I&rsquo;m not sure chancing upon a appallingly configured database is exactly hacking to be fair, but it has the same net effect. Despite Tate&rsquo;s vehement and yet entirely untrue denials, time to re-add The Real World to the list of dubious institutions failing to take any care of the basic privacy and security of its users, as unsympathetic crowd as they may be to some.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Andrew Tate is a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64125045">self-proclaimed misogynist</a> who is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64125045">currently on trial</a>  for several crimes including &ldquo;rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;university&rdquo; is also the only one I&rsquo;ve seen where the first FAQ is &ldquo;Is this program suitable for women?&rdquo;. Despite the answer - which a cynic might claim has strong vibes of &ldquo;YeS of Course! soMeOf my best friEnds aRe Women!?&rdquo; -  I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s actually suitable for anyone.</p>

<p>4 thoughts I always have when this sort of malarkey happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please stop promoting the worst of the ghouls. Overly humanising those who espouse inhuman policies, rendering sympathetic those who lack sympathy, might not be the greatest idea unless done with extreme care.</li>
<li>On the other hand, keep &lsquo;em busy with nonsense and maybe they&rsquo;ll leave politics alone?</li>
<li>What type of twisted mind dreamt up the idea in the first place?</li>
<li>How long am I going to be able to resist watching it? (i.e. what type of twisted mind do <em>I</em> have)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no idea what the show is like to be fair. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll be truly insightful and not at all cringe-worthy sycophancy. Perhaps.</p>

			 <p>An older article from MSNBC explains why <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musks-free-speech-twitter-files-questions-hurt-us-rcna61025">Elon Musk’s basic misunderstandings of free speech are a problem for all of us</a>. Of course he&rsquo;s not the only one who suffers from such delusions. And the dynamics of why this matters specifically in the Elon case have changed a whole lot since the era of the Twitter files in 2022 of course.</p>
<p>But as a refresher, the US First Amendment, like most parts of the Constitution, applies primarily to state action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A private business no more violates the First Amendment by banning particular types of speech in its operations than I violate the First Amendment by not allowing particular types of speech in my home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Privatised social networks aren&rsquo;t able to violate it even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>And secondly, even if the First Amendment was relevant, then not everything that one could possibly imagine being posted online is covered by it. Some of the stuff that Musk was arguing at the time was being hidden in constitution-breaking ways included <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-files-show-biden-campaign-asked-remove-tweets-hunter-biden-2022-12">photos of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s genitalia uploaded without his consent</a>. It&rsquo;s rather ludicrous to imagine that anyone has a protected right to see that. Personally, I&rsquo;m very glad I do not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That would be like arguing that someone who posts revenge porn to the internet has a First Amendment right to have it preserved for all to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, in California where Twitter is headquartered, sharing photos of someone&rsquo;s intimate body parts without their consent is <a href="https://www.cronisraelsandstark.com/revenge-porn-california-penal-code-647j-4">explicitly illegal</a>, covered under the revenge porn law, as well as it being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-files-show-biden-campaign-asked-remove-tweets-hunter-biden-2022-12">against Twitter&rsquo;s own policy</a>. Of course Musk is free to rewrite Twitter&rsquo;s policy as and when he wants to, so I&rsquo;ve no idea if the latter is still true.</p>

			 <p>The British TV channel GB News - right-wing mouth-piece for the worst of Conservative/Reform lame &lsquo;anti-woke&rsquo; culture-war-obsessed warriors - has taken a break from its massive cost cutting exercise in order to burn £100k converting its existing gender-neutral toilets in separate female and male facilities.</p>
<p>Probably because someone laughed at them on Twitter about having them as far as I can gather.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gb-news-blew-100000-getting-34174123">The Mirror</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a source told this newspaper senior GB News figures were so infuriated by the &ldquo;woke&rdquo; bathrooms that they spent eye-watering sums to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure the country sighed in relief at their brave action. At least that&rsquo;s £100k they can&rsquo;t spend on making their inflammatory, offensive and inane programs I suppose.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched Breath of Fire.</p>
<p>This is a 4 part HBO documentary about the rise of a type of yoga called Kundalini in the west, and in particular two people heavily involved in its popularisation over here - Yogi Bhajan who largely introduced the practice to the west and, the show&rsquo;s main focus, Guru Jagat who was prominent under Bhajan&rsquo;s direction and continued its expansion via the RA MA institute which she helped set up in Los Angeles, New York, and Mallorca.</p>
<p>Unfortunately their interpretation of the practice, or at least the institutions they built around it, turned into something of a cult. This series demonstrates some of the dynamics of that wellness-to-cult pipeline.</p>
<p>The institutions and leaders made a ton of money, offering what came down to a form of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/prosperity-gospel">prosperity gospel</a>. Allegations against Bhajan of rape and sexual abuse came forth from its previously enthusiastic participants. Children were treated mistreated; staff were bullied. All in all, this documentary paints a picture of the RA MA institute becoming an increasingly awful and culty place to be. Guru Jagat herself seemed to develop increasingly strange and dangerous beliefs - the sorts of things you might associate with conspiracy theorists such as QAnon.</p>
<p>Kundalini yoga is still actively practiced all around the world - you can attend perfectly non-abusive classes that have nothing to do with the RA MA Institute or conspiracy theories all over the place that many people find helpful. The RA MA institute itself is still active, although not run by Guru Jagat any more, she having died young in 2021 of cardiac arrest caused by a pulmonary embolism after surgery. Yogi Bhajan died in 2004, aged 75.</p>

			 <p>Today is the big vote for our British Parliamentarians on whether we should <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47158287">introduce a law</a> to allow for assisted dying.</p>
<p>Most of the British public are in favour of such a law in principle - 65% for, 13% against in a recent <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/our-work/research/proceeding-with-caution/">More In Common survey</a>.</p>
<p>One surprising thing to me is that the support for such a law - not necessarily this particular law to be clear - in the British population at large doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in any way partisan. At least according to a report from that survey <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/our-work/research/proceeding-with-caution/">More In Common</a> conducted.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or even all that demographically split for that matter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Perhaps we found a miraculous issue that is certainly both emotionally and morally charged - but hasn&rsquo;t descended into an unpleasant 50:50 culture war issue.</p>
<p>The importance of religion to someone seems to be amongst the biggest differentiators - the more religious you are, the more likely you are to oppose such a law. But even in this case more people in every category measured support rather than oppose the idea.</p>

<p>This is a particularly unfortunate hack given that organised crime gangs have something of a reputation for seeking revenge on anyone whom they might regard as disloyal or a threat to their impunity.</p>
<p>It happened as the result of one of the classic phishing exercises:</p>

<p>A staff member was using his work computer when he received a popup warning him his computer had been disabled and to call a number for support. He did so, followed the instructions, and unintentionally gave criminals remote access</p>

			 <p>It was fun to learn that training to be a CIA agent involves <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/the-cia-uses-board-games-to-train-officers-and-i-got-to-play-them/">playing board games</a>.</p>
<p>Not just any old off-the-shelf game mind. These are special CIA-created playthings, including such hidden hits as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection: vibes of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic">Pandemic</a> - &lsquo;a group of players must work together to resolve three major crises across the globe.&rsquo;</li>
<li>Collection Deck: a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-the-gathering">Magic The Gathering</a> like game that &lsquo;focuses less on collaborative work and more on the sheer act of collecting intel&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Satellite Construction Kit: &lsquo;players cooperate to manage resources, budget, and time to build and maintain connected satellites.&rsquo;</li>
<li>Kingpin: The Hunt for El Chapo: used &lsquo;to train analysts who might work with law enforcement and other partners around world to find a well-armed, well-defended, well-protected bad guy&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I suspect that board games are a vastly underutilised opportunity for education. Apparently for the CIA they&rsquo;re particularly good for helping agents learn how to cross-reference vast amounts of information in order to understand how situations they might face in real life might work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;People playing a game, together they&rsquo;re experiencing the designers' mental model of insurgency in Afghanistan and sharing that model,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They are learning it, very quickly, because they&rsquo;re inside, operating in it. Pushing levers, pulling cords, seeing what happens. Stories are very sticky, and they&rsquo;ll remember their own stories.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>The Guardian will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/why-the-guardian-is-no-longer-posting-on-x">no longer officially post on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. I&rsquo;m sure one could critique the decision as having come a bit belatedly. But good for them for doing it at all when so many other journalistic sources seem to think it&rsquo;s still an essential part of their business.</p>
<p>And even better, they spell out their rationale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they spell out, they &ldquo;can do this because our business model does not rely on viral content tailored to the whims of the social media giants’ algorithms&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a good lesson for us all. If your business depends on someone else&rsquo;s company treating your favourably then that&rsquo;s rather risky, even it&rsquo;s not run by a dangerous and unpredictable megalomaniac.</p>
<p>I hope it goes well for them and that readers continue to support them. Who knows, it might even bring in extra punters. Supposedly they raised an extra couple of million of dollars in donations when they went out of their way to endorse Harris, and criticise Trump, in <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/11/05/some-publications-arent.html">the recent debacle</a> of the billionaire owners of the Washington Post and LA Times censoring their journalists.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008329785">Islands of Abandonment: Life in the Post-Human Landscape</a> by Cal Flyn.</p>
<p>In this book, Cal Flyn visits the places that humans have been, oftentimes ravaged , and left in order to explore the nature of &ldquo;life in the post-human landscape&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we will travel to some of the eeriest and most desolate places on earth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many such places. Some she covers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_exclusion_zone">Chernobyl exclusion zone</a> - the site of the infamous 1986 nuclear disaster, and its nearby towns.</li>
<li>The abandoned settlements of  the Scottish Highlands.</li>
<li>The empty villages of the Greek Islands of the Aegean</li>
<li>The now desolate industrial areas of Detroit.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poveglia">Poveglia Island</a>, a former quarantine station and mental asylum.</li>
<li>Kolyma, Siberia, previously home to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolyma#Emergence_of_the_Gulag_camps">forced labour camps</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">The Demilitarized Zone</a> between North and South Korea</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usambara_Mountains">Usambara Mountains</a> in Tanzania, where imperialists planting species from their native country overran the indigenous species of the area.</li>
<li>The huge slag heaps of West Lothian, Scotland, a legacy of the production of oil.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.messynessychic.com/2015/05/26/the-real-no-go-zone-of-france-a-forbidden-no-mans-land-poisoned-by-war/">Place à Gaz</a> in France, where unused chemical weapons were burned after the first world war.</li>
<li>Various Soviet collectives of times past.</li>
<li><a href="">Arthur Kill, New Jersey</a>, where toxic chemicals from industrial processes cause harm to anything or anyone that lives there.</li>
</ul>
<p>However well it is written - and it does contain many surprisingly poetic sentences, beautifully evoking the strange environments under discussion - one might think that this would be nothing other than a book of despair, a dystopia of what we did to our planet.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not really the case. For, as she documents, in many of these places nature has found a way to to re-emerge, to live once again, sometimes even to thrive.</p>
<p>Humans have given up and fled the area, and may never return - or at least most humans, in some of these places a few people remain, for better or worse. But the rest of our planet&rsquo;s organisms have not give up so easily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This should be a book of darkness, a litany of the worse places in the world. In fact, it is a story of redemption: how the most polluted spots on Earth - suffocated by oil spills, blasted by bombs, contaminated by nuclear fallout or scraped clean of their natural resources - can be rehabilitated through ecological processes,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not necessarily things have reset to what was there before, before humans tore the place apart. Apart from anything else, tragically, many species of life have been lost for good. What emerges from these post-human places is often something new, a different ecosystem, organisms that thrive in or managed to adapt to the mess we left behind. These places aren&rsquo;t permanently destroyed, forever destined to be places without life. Instead we see regeneration, a natural re-wilding of a type, untouched by human planners.</p>
<p>And sometimes in a form that might even save us from ourselves - witness the regrowth of forests in previously abandoned Russian farmland that may apparently in theory, though having developed simply because humans left, lead to them meeting their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto Protocol commitments</a>.</p>
<p>This might give us hope that whatever we do to our planet, we will not truly kill it. If we continue to behave in the depraved and irresponsible way that we seem to have so far, it&rsquo;s possible that we might wipe out humanity, sure, or at least render our lives to something more like how she tells us that the residents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City,_California">Slab City</a> live, but planetary life would go on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>State Superintendent Ryan Walters sent superintendents an email Thursday afternoon mandating districts show students a video of him announcing the new Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism and inviting students into a prayer for President-elect Donald Trump, among other topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This from nearly-Trump&rsquo;s America is one of those instances that is so ridiculous that if it was fiction you&rsquo;d think it a foolish exaggeration. Instead it&rsquo;s just weird and scary.</p>
<p>I mean, the &lsquo;Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism&rsquo;. Come on. Apart from anything else surely that should be either no offices or two offices. Just call it &ldquo;Office of I HEART TRUMP PLS GIV ME JOB&rdquo; and be done with it.</p>
<p>The accompanying speech is of course full of violent rhetoric about the &ldquo;radical left&rdquo; and &ldquo;woke&rdquo; and all the usual buzzwords these ridiculous folk like to use.</p>
<p>Here it is, for those who like to punish themselves.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So strange that he forgot to pray for their actual current president, Biden? Oh, and neglected to defend the religious liberty of any religion that isn&rsquo;t whatever subsection of Christianity he presumably follows - no doubt the one that adds &ldquo;Trump&rdquo; to bullet-point two of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">Ten Commandment&rsquo;s</a> list of acceptable gods to worship.</p>
<p>On which note, this isn&rsquo;t this guy&rsquo;s first failure on this front. Previously he&rsquo;s sent a memo to mandate that &ldquo;the Bible&rdquo;, including the all-important 10 commandments, must be taught to everyone in grades 5-12.</p>
<p>Americans United for Separation of Church and States <a href="https://people.com/oklahoma-schools-required-teach-bible-ten-commandments-8671175">have it right</a>. There is nothing about &ldquo;religious freedom&rdquo; to be seen here. Rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is textbook Christian Nationalism: Walters is abusing the power of his public office to impose his religious beliefs on everyone else’s children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another weirdo lawmaker from that area of the country was previously trying to get a law in place <a href="https://www.kosu.org/education/2024-01-05/oklahoma-lawmaker-files-bill-to-mandate-displaying-ten-commandments-in-public-school-classrooms">to make it required</a> to display a poster of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">10 (Christian) Commandments</a> &ldquo;at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall&rdquo; in every school.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Britain&rsquo;s social care system appears to be in a real mess following years of neglect and underfunding. Let&rsquo;s hope this government will be able to fix at least some of the sins of the previous few administrations.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s abhorrent story concerns children who are subjected to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/placing-children-deprivation-of-liberty-orders/placing-children-deprivation-of-liberty-orders">Deprivation of Liberty</a> orders.</p>
<p>DoLs fall under the Mental Capacity Act. In theory they should <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/mental-capacity-act-2005/deprivation-of-liberty/">only be used</a> when taking away someone&rsquo;s freedom is essential to prevent them being harmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/mental-capacity-act-2005/deprivation-of-liberty/">Mind provides</a> an example use-case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon lives in a care home. He has memory problems that have become worse over time. His condition means that he&rsquo;s less aware of danger than others. He&rsquo;s unable to cross a busy road on his own and doesn&rsquo;t understand that it&rsquo;s dangerous to cross a nearby railway line.</p>
<p>Jon needs constant supervision. He has to be stopped from going out on his own. This usually involves keeping him in a locked room and physically stopping him if he tries to go out on his own. To keep him safe, this has to be done on a regular basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the number of DoLs being used on children has doubled, to at least 1000 per year, since 2021.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s guidance says that these children &lsquo;will likely be placed in a children&rsquo;s home or a care home service&rsquo;. But in reality at least half - we apparently don&rsquo;t have an accurate count - of these very vulnerable children are being placed in entirely unsuitable, unregistered, dangerous and illegal accommodation run by profiteering comercial firms, sometimes supervised only by a security guard.</p>
<p>This is, of course, due to a lack of state facilities and personnel, leading to a reliance on the private sector. When does that ever go well?</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/16/fears-grow-over-uk-children-at-risk-placed-in-care-homes">the Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Caravans, Airbnbs. We found a child in such bad accommodation with disabilities that there were rats eating through their feeding tubes every night,&rdquo; De Souza said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had children in tents. It&rsquo;s absolutely shocking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To compound the horror, often they&rsquo;re stuck behind locked doors 100s of miles away from their family and receiving very little in the way of education.</p>
<p>Yet another issue that should be a top priority for this government to try and fix. Apparently we can expect an announcement this week.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/11/16/watched-rivals-this.html">Watch rich people behave badly in a TV adaptation of Jilly Cooper’s book Rivals</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/11/16/watched-rivals-this.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-11-17 10:28:15 &#43;0100">Nov 17, 2024</time></a>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/rivals-2024/">Rivals</a>.</p>
<p>This is an adaption of Jilly Cooper&rsquo;s book of the same name. Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-65710190">likely a fan</a>. It&rsquo;s set in the 1980s with plenty of occasion to enjoy reminiscing about the fashion and music if you experienced it first hand. And lots of &ldquo;rumpy pumpy&rdquo;, as it seems entirely appropriate to describe it as in such an innuendo laden show.</p>
<p>Witness a bunch of very rich and even richer English folk generally get up to no good. Rupert Campbell-Black is a perfect name for such a character, and there he is, clearly supposed to be the world&rsquo;s most handsome man (a relatively young Conservative politician whenever he&rsquo;s not messing about - perhaps more plausible in the 1980s? I don’t know). David Tennant (aka Doctor Who) is also in the mix, as Lord Baddingham.</p>
<p>Basically almost everyone in the show is awful. Constant cheating on their partners, making offensive comments, winding up their neighbours, committing business-related subterfuge all that good stuff. I super-cringed at the storyline where the afore-mentioned Campbell-Black seemed like he was heading for a relationship with someone who appeared to be portraying a teenager and definitely way too young for him. But hey, 1980s Conservative MPs gotta <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/politicians-behaving-badly-7-british-government-scandals/">Conservative MP</a>.</p>
<p>Pure fun/rich people being naughty nonsense, although very occasionally it hits on a serious topic, prejudice and abuse amongst those. But mostly its over-the-top silly fun if you like seeing rich people behave terribly. One of the rare things that Rishi Sunak, big fan of the books, is unambiguously correct about is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-65710190">that you need to have escapism</a> in your life. Particularly during times when he and his colleagues are in charge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s apparently led to a massive <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/31417534/how-to-dress-like-disney-rivals-eighties/">revival of interest in 1980s fashion</a>. Which you too can follow along with using the #80soutfits on Tiktok apparently, if you really want to.</p>

			 <p>🎮 Played <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney--3">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a>.</p>
<p>This a 20 year old visual novel videogame, reissued on a wide variety of platforms. You play Phoenix Wright, a hopefully-up-and-coming defence lawyer.</p>
<p>The game consists of you participating in several court cases, with the goal being to have your clients declared not guilty. During the game you&rsquo;ll regularly alternate between a couple of phases. The first is &ldquo;investigation&rdquo;, wherein you travel to various locations looking for clues, and interviewing whosoever is around to interview. It&rsquo;s here where the story of each crime, or potential crime, is to be elucidated. You also collect up physical evidence for later use in court.</p>
<p>Then we have the court case phase. In that setting, you argue your case in front of a judge. This is mostly done by cross-examining witnesses, which involves picking from a set of phrases to say and backing up your claims by selecting appropriate pieces evidence. The main task here is to find contradictions. Is the witness saying something that doesn&rsquo;t make sense, that&rsquo;s inconsistent with what they previously said? That&rsquo;d be suspicious, right?</p>
<p>The witnesses are of course usually lying, often in quite dramatic ways. But, as a simulated lawyer, you making foolish choices here could lead your client to prison, or simply make the judge angry enough to throw you out of the court room. Mostly it&rsquo;s easy and kind-of-logical enough to figure out the right approach; only very occasionally did I feel like I was clicking random buttons and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>The cases are generally a bit on the wacky side. There are incredible twists and turns, wild new evidence pops up all the times, worthy of the most cliff-hangery of TV crime series. It&rsquo;s also pretty light-hearted. Sure, we&rsquo;re talking about some of the most serious offences going - including murder - but it&rsquo;s usually comedy cartoon style murder being committed, not very graphic or disturbing in how it&rsquo;s presented.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like games with a lot of reading then this isn&rsquo;t for you. But if you enjoy a detective story and want the chance to defend some clients in a visual novelly style, then this is a classic of the genre that should probably be given a whirl. And it works fine on a phone, if that&rsquo;s useful to know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also where the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/objection">&lsquo;Objection!&rsquo; meme</a> came from.</p>

			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/a-haunting-in-venice-2023">A Haunting in Venice</a>.</p>
<p>This is an (apparently loose) adaptation of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s book &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallowe%27en_Party">Hallowe&rsquo;en Party</a>&rsquo;, directed by Kenneth Branagh no less.</p>
<p>The film opens with famed detective Hercule Poirot trying to get on with a nice quiet retirement, spending more time thinking about what type of eggs to eat than murder.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn&rsquo;t last long. His friend, author Ariadne Oliver, persuades him to come to a creepy old house for a séance. She wants his to try and debunk a medium which she has come to believe is legitimately communicating with the dead. Poirot is a massive sceptic about these things, but is eventually persuaded to give it a go.</p>
<p>The event takes place at a house where a young girl, daughter of one of those present, committed suicide. Or was perhaps murdered. One thing naturally leads to another and it turns out that she is not the only violent death the house will be unlucky enough to witness. But&hellip;whodunnit?</p>

<p>The battle for power (and spice) continues at Paul Atreides, his mother, and his surprisingly vocal unborn sister, encounters the Fremen who have to decide whether he&rsquo;s a real deal prophecy or not.</p>
<p>A whole lot more happens than that of course. And it was so long since <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/05/15/watched-dune-let.html">I watched the first part</a> - this one&rsquo;s release was delayed as a result of last year&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66615759">Hollywood strike action</a> - that it took me a while to remember who anyone is. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll face this obstacle again as it ends in a slightly frustrating way that just guarantees there&rsquo;ll be a part 3.</p>
<p>But totally worth the watch nonetheless, especially if you&rsquo;re anything of a sci fi fan. A &ldquo;a work of total sensory and imaginative immersion&rdquo; according to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dune-2-review-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-b2502390.html">the Independent</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s a near-Christmas miracle, Donald Trump&rsquo;s election victory has already improved folk&rsquo;s economic situation, just as he promised -  before he even got inaugurated!</p>
<p>Well, at least if you&rsquo;re one of the top 10 richest people in the world.</p>
<p>The day the result was declared those 10 people saw an increase in wealth of a record-breaking, astonishing, disgusting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-07/trump-s-election-win-supercharges-net-worth-of-world-s-richest-by-64-billion">$64 billion dollars</a>. $27 billion of that went to Trump&rsquo;s very own dancing idiot, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>These increases are of course mostly down to the stock market going up. Elon&rsquo;s Tesla shot up 15%, which is possibly, if anything, quite restrained given that the person that owns the company may well be the same person that sets the rules wherein it and its competitors must operate.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to care about things like &ldquo;conflict of interest&rdquo;?</p>
<p>This of course tells us all we need to know about a) Trump&rsquo;s likely policies and b) investors. I suppose those who already pillaged society for an unfathomable and undeservedly huge amount of humanity&rsquo;s resources look forward to an era even more devoid of taxes and regulations - and little competence to police any that do still remain.</p>

			 <p>The wonderful <a href="https://theonion.com/">Onion</a> has bought Alex Jones' despicable &ldquo;Infowars&rdquo; site.</p>
<p>At least I think it&rsquo;s true? It&rsquo;s not only famously satirical website The Onion that&rsquo;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/onion-buys-infowars-alex-jones-6496f198d141c991087dcd937b3588e9">reporting it</a>.</p>
<p>It comes as a result of Alex Jones' Infowars bankruptcy auction, following him being court-ordered to pay over $1 billion to people on the basis of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-shootings-business-connecticut-alex-jones-c6d0563dc17e7bfa83a881b44e7b9eec">defaming them and their families</a>.</p>
<p>Those families are on board with the idea,. Via <a href="https://www.status.news/p/not-satire-the-onion-acquires-infowars">Status</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The dissolution of Alex Jones’ assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for,&rdquo; said Robbie Parker, whose daughter was killed in the 2012 school shooting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Onion will end up owning Infowars' website, product inventory, social media accounts, customer lists, studio, trademarks and video archive.</p>
<p>Alex Jones is of course not pleased at this outcome claiming, of course, that it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/onion-buys-infowars-alex-jones-6496f198d141c991087dcd937b3588e9">total attack on free speech</a>&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s the pseky Democrats shutting him down as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.status.news/p/not-satire-the-onion-acquires-infowars">part of a political vendetta</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://theonion.com/heres-why-i-decided-to-buy-infowars/">The Onion&rsquo;s take</a> on their owner, Global Tetrahedron&rsquo;s, motivation for doing so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through it all, InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society—values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron.</p>
<p>No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable assets and minds. And yet, in a stroke of good fortune, a formidable special interest group has outwitted the hapless owner of InfoWars (a forgettable man with an already-forgotten name) and forced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion dollars</p>
<p>Make no mistake: This is a coup for our company and a well-deserved victory for multinational elites the world over.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/onion-buys-infowars-alex-jones-6496f198d141c991087dcd937b3588e9">less obviously satirical reporting</a> suggests that they&rsquo;re going to relaunch Infowards next year, featuring:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m reluctant to volunteer my own evidence-free theory into the morass of folk providing weirdly definitive sounding yet conflicting explanations for Why Trump Won from a few minutes after it became clear that he did. But something about this quote from a book I&rsquo;m currently reading, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529198553">1Q84</a>, made me wonder whether it could reflect part of the explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people are not looking for provable truths. As you said, truth is often accompanied by intense pain, and almost no one is looking for painful truths. What people need is beautiful, comforting stories that make them feel as if their lives have some meaning. Which is where religion comes from.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>If a certain belief – call it ‘Belief A’ – makes the life of that man or this woman appear to be something of deep meaning, then for them Belief A is the truth. If Belief B makes their lives appear to be powerless and puny, then Belief B turns out to be a falsehood. The distinction is quite clear. If someone insists that Belief B is the truth, people will probably hate him, ignore him, or, in some cases, attack him. It means nothing to them that Belief B might be logical or provable. Most people barely manage to preserve their sanity by denying and rejecting images of themselves as powerless and puny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignore for the moment that it&rsquo;s said by a character who at present appears to me to be a detestable and self-serving cult leader (I refer to the character in the book of course, it&rsquo;s merely a coincidence if someone else in this post might fit the same description).</p>

			 <p>Trump&rsquo;s election promises weren&rsquo;t only meaningless because they were almost certainly bullshit (referring of course here to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit">academic definition of such</a>), but also because the Biden administration has already done a lot of them.</p>

<li>Imports from China are down</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s little left to like about the British honours system, if there ever was. In recent times it became, functionally, mostly a way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/29/liz-truss-gives-peerages-to-brexit-architect-and-tory-donor">people who donate a lot of money to the Conservative party</a> to feel like a special Very Important snowflake and/or get into the House of Lords to aid whichever cruel and unusual cause the leader of the day was trying to get through the Commons . Although some people who aren&rsquo;t made of true evil do also get recognised, which can make it a bit confusing.</p>
<p>As are the specific names given to the honors.  There are actually five classes on offer, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire">Wikipedia lists</a> as being named in the follow preposterous manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knight Grand Cross or Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE)</li>
<li>Knight Commander or Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE or DBE)</li>
<li>Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE)</li>
<li>Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE)</li>
<li>Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE)</li>
</ul>
<p>I personally thought a GBE was some kind of handheld Nintendo console, but there we go.</p>
<p>In any case, you might note that they all heavily feature the word &ldquo;Empire&rdquo;, which for a country that no longer has one, and almost certainly should be very ashamed of what it did when it did have one, is odd. And off-putting to quite a few people outside of the stereotype red-faced self-entitled political donors who fantasise about nothing more than ruling over the disenfranchised masses whilst holding Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s hand. Several folk have in fact turned down receiving the honour because of the connotations associated with the E word.</p>
<p>Benjamin Zephaniah, poet, was offered one. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/27/poetry.monarchy">wasn&rsquo;t keen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me? I thought, OBE me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word &ldquo;empire&rdquo;; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds of thousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howard Gayle, footballer, also had to politely decline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact is that I felt it would be a slap in the face for so many to be part of that British empire process. When you look at what the empire did to my family and our ancestors, it just doesn’t bear credence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So finally, the name might be changed. Apparently<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/04/british-empire-honours-system-king-charles"> even the King of England is on board</a> with switching the E in OBE to mean Excellence instead of Empire. I mean, the exact same thought had been had <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/212/21202.htm">20 years ago</a>, but I suppose it&rsquo;s just possible its time has finally come.</p>
<p>Presumably if the honour is there to celebrate &ldquo;Excellence&rdquo; then in theory most of the ones awarded in the last few years will have to be handed back. Honestly I suspect the system is quite honestly so rotten that abolishing it wholesale is the only real answer - but in the absence of that an acknowledgement of what &ldquo;empire&rdquo;, then and now, actually meant is better than literally nothing.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780857529671">Rough Justice</a> by Wendy Joseph.</p>
<p>This a sort of sequel to Joseph&rsquo;s previous book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473597778">Unlawful Killings</a>, which I <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/04/21/unlawful-killings-insights.html">read last year</a>, although you could happily read them in either order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s organised in a very similar way to her former offering. Wendy Joseph was a Crown Court judge. She takes us through a set of cases that are technically fictional but based on an amalgam of real trials, detailing what happens in the court room. So we get a mix of law-and-order but trueish-crime style stories along with information about court procedures and points of law that it behoves us to know about our justice system.</p>
<p>This time we have two themes that she focuses on via her selection of cases.</p>
<p>The first is the topic of justice itself. She notes that our approach to punishment has softened over time; no more do we legally disembowel, behead or hang perceived wrongdoers. But in terms of establishing the guilty/not guilty verdicts themselves, of bringing criminals to justice - whatever that means -  she asks whether we&rsquo;ve actually become all that more just over time or not.</p>
<p>On that, her conclusion is distressingly unsure. Some attempts at progress have certainly been made, but was it all that we could have done, and are they given adequate priority?</p>
<p>Some of the evidence for or against the proposition comes from comparisons of her modern-day cases with ones from the Old Bailey&rsquo;s extensive archives which often have distinct parallels.</p>
<p>Her other focus is on cases involving women. Women commit less crime than men, and when they do so it tends to be more minor, less violent crime. There are of course exceptions. There&rsquo;s more than enough to construct some interesting cases to consider. Lawyers, jurors and other court staff can also of course be women. Society of course has dynamics we should consider that make all of these roles more challenging than they are for the typical man. The author herself witnessed and was subject to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-61757147">plenty of sexual harassment</a>.</p>
<p>The book starts off with a case involving a man accused of sexually abusing a young girl. The next is a young lady accused of murdering, dismembering and disposing of the remains of an older lady. Then a wife who kills her husband after years of abuse. And finally, a grandmother, who together with her son, is in the dock for harbouring a weapon that led to tragedy in the hands of her grandson</p>
<p>In several of these cases there&rsquo;s not really much ambiguity as to whether at least part of the violent act was committed. But, even when we can figure out who did it, committing an act of violence isn&rsquo;t the same as committing the criminal offence of violence.</p>
<p>Killing someone, for instance, has at least 6 potential defences one might consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The alibi: It wasn&rsquo;t me.</li>
<li>Accident: I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it.</li>
<li>Lack of intent: I wanted to hit him but not intending to do great harm.</li>
<li>Self-defence: I only hurt him to stop him hurting me.</li>
<li>Diminished responsibility: My mental condition reduces my responsibility for what I did.</li>
<li>Loss of control: He did or said something that would have made any reasonable person in my position snap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of Joseph&rsquo;s conclusion is that whilst reforming court practice is absolutely necessary and should be prioritised, there are places in the journey well before a case gets to the attention of a judge that must also be addressed.</p>
<p>We might ask why so much sexual violence, typically (but not always) committed against women of course, is not reported. And why so little of that which is reported is dropped before ever getting as far as to result a criminal charge, let alone a court case.</p>
<p>And even earlier in the process; it&rsquo;s surely far preferable to stop a crime being committed in the first place than to have it considered after the fact by even the fairest of trials. Why then, in this case, do women commit crime? And why is crime committed against women? Is there anything in the understand of that could be used to prevent it in the first place?</p>
<p>The causes of crime are extensive and multifaceted - nature, nurture, lifestyle et al. But there are surely, for instance, social determinants of these matters, some of which society consistently fails to address.</p>
<p>Whilst the court system must be dramatically improved - which involves committing substantial resources to it - we can ease the burden on it and, far more importantly, the horrific impact of crime on people&rsquo;s lives, by reducing the number of occasions where people feel compelled to commit crime in the first place.</p>

<p>Sometimes fear triumphs over hope.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>This time there is no excuse. America knew that he was a convicted criminal, serial liar and racist demagogue who four years ago attempted to overthrow the government. It voted for him anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democratic and progressive Americans, at least 67 million of whom voted for Harris, struggled to come to terms with the overnight reality. They were confronted by the fact that Trump&rsquo;s pitch to the American people, built on his dark and lie-packed vision of a country in terminal decline, &ldquo;swamped&rdquo; by murdering &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo;, and on the point of a communist takeover, had prevailed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As does <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/trump-election-watch-party-florida">much of the rest of the world</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world, too, will be reeling. It has long known the most powerful nation on earth committed war crimes from Vietnam to Iraq. Many will now take the view that has also committed a crime against decency and democracy itself.</p>

			 <p>Unlike <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/11/03/cowardly-tech-billionaires.html">the enfeebled Washington Post and LA Time</a>s, the Guardian isn&rsquo;t pulling many punches on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/white-house-race-armageddon-election">its front page</a>. Granted it isn&rsquo;t under the same jurisdiction as the two aforementioned institutions, and it also<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Media_Group"> isn&rsquo;t owned by a a cowardly tech billionaire</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America’s moment of reckoning has arrived. On Tuesday, the nation will hold a presidential election like none before, poised between the historic candidacy of a Black woman and a former president branded a fascist by his own former officials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2024/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-us-presidential-election-2024-a-democratic-government-is-the-one-we-need">Their formal endorsement</a>came a couple of weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Defeating Mr Trump protects <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/washington-dc-role-play-second-trump-term">democracy</a> from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A surprisingly (to me, perhaps it should not have been) good effort from a US based publication came from <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kamala-harris-but-a-donald-trump-win-would-be-catastrophic">Teen Vogue&rsquo;s Harris endorsement</a>. They made the very valid point that even if you don&rsquo;t like Harris' policies - specifically in their case the actions taken on the Israel/Gaza conflict - Trump would be so much worse on the same things, and furthermore make it hard to organise against it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump cannot win this election. Full stop.</p>
<p>Right now, we have the power to make sure that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Autocrats thrive on overwhelming people. President Trump overwhelmed us every single day.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not enough to beat a fascist with razor-thin margins; ideally, we need to run up the margin of victory so high it becomes that much harder for Trump and his cronies to claim they represent the will of the American people.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Right now, we have the power to stop Trump. Should he win, we may not have these tools at our disposal again. Trump is on the record telling conservative Christians he just needs them to vote this year and then they won’t have to vote again. “Four more years, it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,” he said this summer, one of many comments that should have set off a weeks-long scandalous news cycle but got subsumed by, well, everything else. He has an army of election deniers ready to do his corrupt, anti-democratic bidding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In being censored by their owners from making an endorsement, the Washington Post and LA Times appear to have lost a lot of their subscribers. Semafor reports, in an article wonderfully titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business">The Washington Post sold Democracy. Now it needs a new line of business</a>&rdquo; that the WaPo lost at least 200,000 of them - a cost <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/jeff-bezos-washington-post-endorsement-decision-cost-8-million-dollars/">thought to represent</a> a possible $20 million in revenue. The LA Times lost at least 18,000, with both figures potentially still growing.</p>
<p>This, <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/28/2024/the-washington-post-sold-democracy-now-it-needs-a-new-line-of-business?ref=platformer.news">in their view</a> is at least in part down to many subscribers to newspapers doing so as part of an effort to support &ldquo;capital-J journalism&rdquo; rather than merely improved access to a specific product&rsquo;s content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans didn’t necessarily feel they needed the Post’s journalism or its service products, but they did want Journalism with a capital J, a force willing to take Trump on directly and to absorb his wrath when other institutions weren’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That feels right to me. Whenever I have subscribed to a newspaper it wasn&rsquo;t usually for the content. There&rsquo;s<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/23/two-types-of.html"> more than enough information of interest</a> floating around the internet &ldquo;for free&rdquo; - free if you disregard the payment taken via the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/04/the-age-of.html">secretive harvesting of your personal data</a> at least.</p>
<p>It was because I supported the process and the people that created that content; supported the effort to go out there, do the no doubt often grueling work that stands some chance of informing us about reality, and critically, to expose and challenge the powerful when they lie to or otherwise abuse us.</p>
<p>Not that this should be the point, but endorsing Harris certainly didn&rsquo;t cost the Guardian much in terms of subscriber or direct revenue. Rather it apparently let to a big increase in donations - around $2 million - making it, <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/north-america/betsy-reed-guardian-us/">according to the Press Gazette</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;one of the most successful subscription marketing messages in the history of online news.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As everyone on the internet noticed, all of a sudden last week the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post newspaper</a> decided that for the first time in a few decades <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement">they weren&rsquo;t going to endorse a candidate</a> for the presidential election.</p>
<p>This has not gone down well. It doesn&rsquo;t help that the paper adopted the tagline &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Dies_in_Darkness">democracy dies in darkness</a>&rdquo; a few years ago. Cue statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So much for “Democracy Dies in Darkness”. This is the most hypocritical, chicken shit move from a publication that is supposed to hold people in power to account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1849869496456184179">from Susan Rice</a>, former US ambassador to the UN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/davidfolkenflik/status/1849855414571237430">from Marty Baron</a>, a former Washington Post executive editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper I&rsquo;ve loved working at for 47 years is dying in darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/maranissdavid/status/1849871015964242413">says David Maraniss</a>, a reporter and editor at the Post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today has been an absolute stab in the back. What an insult to those of us who have literally put our careers and lives on the line, to call out threats to human rights and democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://x.com/KarenAttiah/status/1849876910337106424">says Karen Attiah</a>, WaPo columnist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Post’s editorial board just won a Pulitzer Prize for calling out authoritarianism and defending democracy around the world&hellip;How sad is it that we can’t do that at home?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as an anonymous &ldquo;senior Post staffer&rdquo; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/washington-post-endorsement-president-election">told The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>A union with many WaPo employees in, the Washington Post Guild, expressed its <a href="https://x.com/postguild/status/1849869546078994727">deep concern</a> at the decision.</p>
<p>What is particularly disgusting about the manoeuvre is the reason that it happened. It wasn&rsquo;t that the editorial writers had nothing to say on the subject, that the reporters didn&rsquo;t think they knew enough to have an opinion, or that it was decided sometime between 2020 and now that the Opinion section of a newspaper must never in fact contain any Opinion. In fact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/oct/25/washington-post-will-not-endorse-presidential-candidate">the Washington Post team had already written</a> an endorsement for Kamala Harris. It had already <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris">been approved</a> by the editorial page editor, David Shipley.</p>
<p>But then, the Washington Post owner - who is none other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>, who, most famously, founded and CEOd Amazon along with all the catastrophe that that particular enterprise unleashed upon the world - ordered them to pull it at the last minute. Ergo it was censored it out of existence, never to see the light of day, destined to die in darkness.</p>
<p>Yes, once again one of the weird tech billionaires is interfering with the standard practice of democracy, seemingly for nothing other than peculiarly selfish and small-minded reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/tech-ceos-trump-election-bezos-zuckerberg/">Platformer summarises the likely reasons</a> as including basically being out of fear that if Bezos was even vaguely connected to something that might be read as criticising President Trump then Trump might take it out on him later if, heaven forefend, he became president. Which doesn&rsquo;t seem like an unreasonable fear based on Trump&rsquo;s previous behaviour. But, come on, we are talking about Amazon billionaire Jeffrey Bezos. I think he might just survive. He&rsquo;ll be able to pay his bills (or, more likely, pay someone to pay someone to pay someone to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/15/amazon-tax-bill-2018-no-taxes-despite-billions-profit">avoid having to pay his bills</a>).</p>
<p>Another possible reason might be payback to the current Democrat administration who have been overseeing a surprisingly strong - well, in a relative sense -  pushback against some of the Big Tech monopolists, pursuing antitrust cases against a slew of companies including Bezos' own <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/22/lawsuit-against-amazon-expected-next-week-00117609">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair Bezos isn&rsquo;t alone in this. His other weird tech billionaire pals are also cosying up to the disgraced ex-president, just in case.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-ceos-trump-claims-are-courting-him">Wired</a>, Google CEO Sundar Pichai apparently called Trump so congratulate him on his bizarre &ldquo;I work at McDonalds&rdquo; stunt. Apple&rsquo;s Tim Cook has also been on the blower plenty. Meta&rsquo;s Zuckerberg called him up, presumably to congratulate him on being a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/07/19/mark-zuckerberg-praises-badass-trump-after-assassination-attempt-but-doesnt-endorse-him/">badass</a>&rdquo;, after the first assassination attempt, something that Bezos also did before the Washington Post incident.</p>
<p>The WaPo wasn&rsquo;t the only newspaper to have its presidential endorsement story burned by its owner. It seemed to generate a bit less publicity, but eagle-eyed readers of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-09-10/los-angeles-times-elections-endorsements-2024-november">LA Times endorsement list</a> last month might have noticed the distinct absence of a presidential endorsement. So in a way this is even weirder; they&rsquo;ve no problem with the concept of political endorsements. There&rsquo;s plenty on that list. They just decided to not publish one for the position that comes with the most impactful amount of political power going.</p>
<p>Well, I say &ldquo;they&rdquo;. Again the blocking of an endorsement wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;they&rdquo; decision. The team had already decided that they were going to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/g-s1-29665/la-times-editor-resigns-presidential-endorsement">endorse Kamala Harris</a>.  It was a &ldquo;he&rdquo; decision.</p>
<p>Once again the article itself was blocked pre-publication, apparently the decision to censor was made by the paper&rsquo;s owner - Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong.</p>
<p>In reaction to their article being blocked by the paper&rsquo;s owner, the editorial editor Mariel Garza felt <a href="">compelled to resign</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Garza said. “In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I’m standing up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a strong parallel to the WaPo&rsquo;s equivalent, the LA Times Guild Unit Council &amp; Bargaining Committee reported that it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;deeply concerned about our owner’s decision to block a planned endorsement in the presidential race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case Dr. Soon-Shiong&rsquo;s sensibilities aren&rsquo;t clear, he&rsquo;s not a newspaper man by trade. Rather, he is - can you guess? - a (bio)tech billionaire who in the past has been seen &ldquo;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/21/trump-soon-shiong/">palling around</a>&rdquo; with Donald Trump, begging him for a job.</p>
<p>He may be the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/09/10/medicines-manhattan-project-can-the-worlds-richest-doctor-fix-health-care/#1421f5714c36">richest doctor in the world</a>, but is nonetheless a man so delusional that following one such dinner with the president-at-the=time he <a href="https://x.com/DrPatSoonShiong/status/800457388801171456">publicly shared</a> that it was an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incredible honor dining w/Pres-elect <a href="https://micro.blog/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>  last night. He truly wants to advance healthcare for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For all&rdquo;. Hmm.</p>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/01/how-patrick-soon-shiong-made-his-fortune-before-buying-the-la-times">New Yorker profile</a> of the good doctor makes it clear that he does have certain lifestyle similarities to Trump. For example, they&rsquo;ve both been repeatedly taken to court over various violations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He gets very enthusiastic, and sometimes he might exaggerate,” Hentz said. “He can embellish a little.” Outcomes for his diabetes treatment were disappointing, and one case ended tragically.</p>
<p>While pursuing this therapy, he also began researching chemotherapy. At the center of his fortune is a cancer treatment that costs more than a hundred times as much as another drug, available as a generic, that is prescribed for some of the same conditions.</p>
<p>Soon-Shiong has been repeatedly accused of financial misrepresentation, self-dealing, price gouging, and fraud. He has been sued by former investors and business partners; he has been sued by other doctors; he has been sued by his own brother, twice; he has been sued by Cher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not even get started on Elon Musk - the richest master-performer of self-cringe that ever lived - who is now acting as Trump&rsquo;s pet, literally (but awkwardly) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/style/elon-musk-donald-trump-campaign-rally.html">jumping for joy</a>, or whatever the Musk form of that emotion may be, on a public stage during his campaigning. As it happens, in between occurrences of this &ldquo;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/06/musk-i-m-dark-maga-am">I&rsquo;m not just MAGA - I&rsquo;m dark Maga</a>&rdquo; buffoon upwardly prostrating his body into some form akin to a broken X-shape for Likes, he&rsquo;s also <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/10/elon-musk-2024-election-bribing-voters-trump.html">quite possibly breaking voter bribery laws</a>.</p>
<p>These people - each of whom has more access to power and resources than any human should ever have, and have vastly benefited from so many aspects of the very systems of governance that Trump threatens to derail - are each presumably somewhere on the scale between MAGA-pilled ideologue true believers and selfish, spiteful, cowards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.platformer.news/tech-ceos-trump-election-bezos-zuckerberg">Casey Newton sums it up</a> well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not, of course, a moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. There is no moral case for business leaders supporting Trump. Trump is an openly corrupt 78-year-old fascist, twice impeached and on 34 felony counts convicted, who attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power in 2021 and now promises to further undermine the democracy of the United States if he manages to assume power again.</p>
<p>But a democratic emergency like the one we are now living through is not necessarily a business emergency. In the billionaires’ view, it could actually be an opportunity — to bring an end to the antitrust cases, to block further regulation of Big Tech in Congress, and to pursue their dreams of superintelligence in peace.</p>

			 <p>Admittedly this isn&rsquo;t the most pressing issue of the forthcoming US presidential election, but all the excitement of seeing <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-visits-mcdonalds-handed-meals-174924999.html">Donald Trump pretend to work</a> in a McDonalds for a few minutes as part of a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/10/22/trump-mcdonalds-visit/">staged political stunt</a> brings back to mind the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trumps-typical-mcdonalds-order-snacks_n_5a259dbde4b03350e0b8c2bb">previous revelation of his usual order</a> when attending that institution as a customer (or sending someone to do so on his behalf).</p>
<p>As<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trumps-typical-mcdonalds-order-snacks_n_5a259dbde4b03350e0b8c2bb"> revealed by a couple of his former colleagues</a>, his typical order would be 2 Big Macs, 2 Fillet-O-Fish and a chocolate milkshake.</p>
<p>What an&hellip;interesting combo. Grounds alone to accuse him of an incredible lack of judgement. It also represents substantially than his recommended calorie intake for a day consumed in one fell swoop: <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trumps-typical-mcdonalds-order-snacks_n_5a259dbde4b03350e0b8c2bb">at least 2672</a>, or more if it wasn&rsquo;t a small shake.</p>
<p>It seems even being prosecuted in court didn&rsquo;t sate his appetite, with reports of a &ldquo;<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/02/trump-mcdonalds-delivery-court-fraud-trial-19593129/">Massive stash of McDonalds</a>’ being delivered to a court when he was there to defend one of the many legal cases against him.</p>

			 <p>It seems that US Republican affiliated groups may have commissioned presidential election polls that are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/republicans-donald-trump-polls-us-election-lawsuits">deliberately biased</a> towards saying Trump will win.</p>
<p>This as a possible prelude to the horrific but plausible idea that if Trump loses then team MAGA will use &lsquo;but the polls said Trump has the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37483869">bigliest</a> lead&rsquo; as (manufactured) evidence of some imaginary tranche of electoral fraud. They&rsquo;d conclude of course that even though he got the least votes he should in any case be crowned the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/liz-cheney-warns-trump-will-never-leave-office-elected-president-rcna127889">some-would-say-wannabe permanent king</a> of what we previously referred to as the &lsquo;<a href="https://www.historicalindex.org/what-does-the-leader-of-the-free-world-mean.htm">free world</a>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I heard suggestions that the actual legitimate pollsters were potentially underestimating Harris, deliberately or not, on the basis that failing - <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/">once again</a> - to predict a Trump victory would be embarrassing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope then that the former story isn&rsquo;t true - or at least isn&rsquo;t effective in what the people concerned trying to accomplish - and the latter is.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wary of succumbing to my own biases by seeing the risks of the rise of the far right looming around every political event no matter how minor, but it&rsquo;s hard to not to feel a certain amount of hopeless despair when it comes to forthcoming US election.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ve overdosed on <a href="https://timothysnyder.org/books">Timothy Synder&rsquo;s excellent books</a>, but when one sees things like the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/donald-trump-madison-square-garden-rally/">Madison Square Trump rally</a> it&rsquo;s hard not to hear several extremely loud metaphorical warning klaxons go off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump vowed to win New York, saying it would be an &ldquo;honor&rdquo; to win his home state. But his remarks were overshadowed by the crude and offensive speakers that went before him, which included racist jokes about Puerto Ricans and Black people as well as prominent Democrats.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to Trump, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by Kill Tony, referred to Puerto Rico as a &ldquo;floating island of garbage,&rdquo; made a crude joke about Hispanics and birth control, inferred that Jews are cheap and Palestinians are &ldquo;rock-throwers&rdquo; and made a racist comment about a Black man in the audience eating watermelon.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other warm-up acts called Hillary Clinton a &ldquo;sick son of a b***&rdquo;, another referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as the &ldquo;antichrist&rdquo; and a third said Harris &ldquo;and her pimp handlers will destroy the country.&rdquo; Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Harris is &ldquo;on the side of the terrorists.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For all their many harmful, dangerous and deadly faults, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the UK Conservatives PRing themselves like that. It feels qualitatively different.</p>
<p>Next up, I suppose there&rsquo;s no need to spend time <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html">lying about vote fraud</a> when you can just burn the votes</p>
<p>A ballot box in <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/incendiary-device-set-off-inside-se-portland-ballot-box-causing-fire">Portland</a> and another in <a href="https://www.katu.com/news/local/vancouver-ballot-box-seen-smoking-same-morning-as-portland-ballot-box-arson?__readwiseLocation=">Vancouver</a> were set on fire, potentially disenfranchising the wise folk who had already voted early via depositing their ballot into one of them. I don&rsquo;t think we know much about the what and why this happened yet, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem exactly normal let alone good. If it makes any difference, the states concerned are (usually) safe Democratic seats.</p>
<p>Finally for now, continuing the habit that US MAGA-style Republicans have of saying the quiet bit out loud, we have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga">ProPublica&rsquo;s reporting</a> about the previously private speeches of Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;key ally&rdquo; and previous director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vough. He&rsquo;s thought to be very likely to get a high-level governmental role should Trump get back into power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key ally to former President Donald Trump detailed plans to deploy the military in response to domestic unrest, defund the Environmental Protection Agency and put career civil servants “in trauma” in a series of previously unreported speeches that provide a sweeping vision for a second Trump term.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Other policies mentioned by Vought dovetail with Trump’s plans, such as embracing a wartime footing on the southern border and rolling back transgender rights&hellip;decrying the “transgender sewage that’s being pumped into our schools and institutions” and referring to gender-affirming care as “chemical castration.”</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” he said. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can&rsquo;t do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to put them in trauma.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cruelty as praxis, once again.</p>

			 <p>Last year, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">laid out their view</a> as to how true or useful the &ldquo;artificial intelligence is the new nuclear weapons&rdquo; analogy actually is. The high-level summary of their take is:</p>
<p>Similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scientific progress on the technology has been very rapid.</li>
<li>There is potential for mass harm, even if the mechanism is generally less obvious in the case of AI.</li>
<li>Both require materials - uranium for nukes, certain types of microchips for AI - that are relatively scare and potentially trackable.</li>
<li>They have dynamics of an arms race.</li>
</ul>
<p>Differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear weapons are a wholly military technology, AI is a general-purpose one.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s much easier to copy someone&rsquo;s AI than their nuclear bomb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their takeaway is that the general &ldquo;AI is like a nuclear weapon&rdquo; analogy is usually quite parallel enough to prove useful, but that certain specific processes involved are similar. And in any case, in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to handle a new, powerful, dangerous technology is through broad international cooperation. The right approach isn’t to lie back and just let scientists and engineers transform our world without outside input.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/oppenheimer-2023">Oppenheimer</a>.</p>
<p>This is the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the scientist who led the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory"> Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, assigned in 1942 to the task of developing the world&rsquo;s first nuclear weapon. Whilst he appeared to some reservations from the start, the race was on given his fear that the German Nazis might beat them to it which might then lead them to victory during the ongoing Second World War.</p>
<p>The nuclear bomb Oppenheimer et al. developed of course worked, even if whilst during testing the effects of atomic detonation they weren&rsquo;t <em>absolutely</em> certain that it wouldn&rsquo;t cause the literal end of the world. So quite a high-stakes workplace, at least compared to the average day of work in my job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/05/25/ai-vs-nukes-this-is-much-more-dangerous-00098862">some people</a> might see <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">modern-day parallels</a> with the unconstrained development of AI, even if the mechanisms towards destruction are a lot less straightforward.</p>
<p>After the nuclear bomb was used against Japan in 1945 - in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> - Oppenheimer became an advisor to the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>He became ridden with guilt about the sheer amount of destruction and huge loss of life that his life&rsquo;s work to date had led to. His ethical concerns led him to argue for global control of nuclear power to avoid nuclear proliferation, particularly the risk of an escalation of the technology during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. This led him to opposing the development of the H-bomb, contrary to the President&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>This, along with his past associations with the Communist Party, meant that he was subject to accusations of disloyalty. He ended up in front of a private security hearing, after which his security clearance was revoked.</p>
<p>The film is three hours long, but it&rsquo;s a big story to tell, and an important one. It very much captured my interest throughout, even if my ability to find such a lengthy continuous timespan of focus given the constraints of modern life is such that I ended up have to watch it over two sittings.</p>

<p>Whilst campaigning, Trump often makes a series of claims about what he will do that at a glance seem too ludicrous or cruel to be true.</p>
<p>In the past it&rsquo;s often been suggested, especially by some of his high profile supporters, that we should take Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/31/13477236/trump-seriously-literally-thiel">seriously but not literally</a>, to <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-symbolically-anthony-scaramucci-232848">take him symbolically, not literally</a>.

<p>The article goes through the what he says and why you should believe him using the following categories.</p>
<p>Trump says he will:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Justice Department to punish people he doesn’t like.</li>
<li>will round up and deport millions of immigrants.</li>
<li>deploy the American military against U.S. citizens.</li>
<li>allow vigilante violence to end crime.</li>

			 <p><a href="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/abortion-mazes/">The Pudding visualises</a> the often laborious and damaging path some who needs an abortion needs to take if situated in the US as a series of mazes.</p>
<p>Even whilst. Roe vs Wade was in force the process was often full of &ldquo;twists, turns and roadblocks&rdquo;. But now, since its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn">overturning in 2022</a>, states have the power to take away someone&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/sexual-and-reproductive-rights/abortion-facts/">right to an abortion</a>, even to ban abortion entirely. <a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/10-things-to-know-about-abortion-access-since-the-dobbs-decision/">13 did exactly that</a>. Some other states made access harder, and a few put new legislation in place to protect this important right.</p>
<p>Whilst interacting with <a href="https://pudding.cool/2024/10/abortion-mazes/">The Pudding&rsquo;s visualisation</a> you find yourself following a story of an individual, based on a real-life case, who is seeking such a service whilst trying to make your way through a literal maze of a complexity related to the real life difficulty of obtaining this important medical care - whether this be, for instance, California&rsquo;s relatively simple process or Tennessee&rsquo;s fiendishly complicated effort.</p>
<p>In no case are the individual&rsquo;s stories entirely uncomplicated. A maze is still a maze. But this very effectively, and very creatively, highlights the huge variation in the access our US friends have to this <a href="https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/abortion-is-healthcare">type of healthcare</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/23/two-types-of.html">Two types of information overload: the situational vs the ambient</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/23/two-types-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-10-23 08:35:00 &#43;0100">Oct 23, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have an information problem. There are 278 books on my &ldquo;Want to read list&rdquo;. There are 1,794 articles saved in my read-later app. There appear to be 2,241 episodes in my podcasts &ldquo;to listen to&rdquo; queue. The knowledge of hundreds of pending unread journal articles put me off ever even opening my collection of them to check.</p>
<p>Then on the other side of the equation there&rsquo;s the collection of hundred of read items I want to blog about, and several half-written posts about a fraction of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat ashamed to say I even started a new RSS reader account on the basis that my collection of feeds felt somewhat unmanageable when all in one place. I guess I&rsquo;m going to have to stop teasing my colleague for starting a new Google mail account because their previous one filled up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absurd. I&rsquo;ve only got one lifetime, as far as I know. And it&rsquo;s not like these numbers don&rsquo;t grow every single day.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not alone in this. <a href="https://www.newcartographies.com/p/haystacks-of-needles">Nicholas Carr writes</a> about two forms of information overload, only one of which is solvable by the standard solution of improving the information filters, search and prioritisation algorithms that are available to us.</p>
<p>One can intuitively feel this to be true. We have so many more electronic facilities to aid us in sorting through and finding high quality material than we used to - even whilst acknowledging that some of the more famous ones are <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-search-low-quality-research">perhaps getting worse</a>. But who feels like they have <em>less</em> information overload now than in the past?</p>
<p>In Carr&rsquo;s view, that&rsquo;s because these filtering systems only solve &ldquo;situational overload&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Situational overload is the needle-in-the-haystack problem: You need a particular piece of information — in order to answer a question of one sort or another — and that piece of information is buried in a bunch of other pieces of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many information-sorting technologies, from the introduction of indexes, catalogues and the Dewey Decimal system onwards, have made inroads into this.</p>
<p>But these systems don&rsquo;t help with &ldquo;ambient overload&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambient overload doesn’t involve needles in haystacks. It involves haystack-sized piles of needles.</p>
<p>We experience ambient overload when we’re surrounded by so much information that is of immediate interest to us that we feel overwhelmed by the neverending pressure of trying to keep up with it all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly right. I&rsquo;m not confused as to which handful of my 278 to-read books are actually going to be of interest to me. In principle they all are. I hand-selected them. This is a post-filtered list, full of likely needles; full of signal, not obscured by noise.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s best search isn&rsquo;t going to help me here. In fact, improving the filters we have available to us simply pushes ever-increasing amounts of ever-more interesting content in our direction.</p>
<p>There are people trying to solve this problem, but no solution that I&rsquo;ve seen feels very satisfying. For example, there are multiple book summarisation services - <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">Blinkist</a>, <a href="https://www.shortform.com/">Shortform</a> and their ilk - which I&rsquo;ve played with a bit in the past. Whilst they have their uses I don&rsquo;t find them to be an adequate substitute for the original material. Let alone the modern AI based solutions - either the generic &ldquo;Please, chatbot, summarise this book in 2 paragraphs&rdquo; options or the dedicated &ldquo;summarisation services&rdquo;. Many people naturally have ethical concerns about the type of AI they typically use, alongside the ever-present risk that they in fact fail to summarise the content correctly.</p>
<p>If however we determine that these services do have a legitimate place, then again I feel like - at least for me - they&rsquo;re addressing situational overload. I&rsquo;d be using them as filters for &ldquo;do I want to read the whole thing?&rdquo; rather than as a substitute for &ldquo;I have read the whole thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;ve a need to get the basic gist of a book very quickly but have no desire to spend substantial time working through it then those services might potentially work well for that - I haven&rsquo;t checked the efficacy studies! - but that lack of <em>desire</em> isn&rsquo;t the problem I face.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? Carr doesn&rsquo;t really present one. Perhaps there are none, other than somehow reconciling oneself to be able to happily live whilst giving up on the idea that we could possibly indulge in even a sizeable fraction of the things we&rsquo;re interested in within this new(ish) world of information abundance.

			 <p>Currently trying out a combo of <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> and <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> to experience the joy (?) of aggregating, managing and perusing RSS feeds without relying on someone else&rsquo;s cloud service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> is &ldquo;A free, self-hostable feed aggregator&rdquo;. Think <a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader">Feedly</a>, Google Reader (RIP) et al. but self-hostable, open source, private (if you want it to be) and subscription-free. You can access it via the web, desktop or mobile. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from their site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> is one of many client RSS apps that are out there that can sync with FreshRSS if you prefer reading your feeds in an app. This one has the selling point being both free, open source and, again, not infused with features to sell your brain to the highest bidder.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are of course several similar options if those two don&rsquo;t float your boat.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got nothing to hide then you&rsquo;ve nothing to fear&rdquo; is a common response to those of us who worry about the ever-increasing rise of systematic and universal surveillance and the peel-back of privacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s snappy and intuitive. But wrong. I prefer one of the following constructions.</p>
<p>From Edward Snowden&rsquo;s autobiography - at least that&rsquo;s where I think I read it? It&rsquo;s certainly <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7308507-arguing-that-you-don-t-care-about-the-right-to-privacy">something he said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguing that you don&rsquo;t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don&rsquo;t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Shoshana Zuboff&rsquo;s pivotal book, &ldquo;<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/04/the-age-of.html">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real psychological truth is this: If you’ve got nothing to hide, you are nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a right. <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/impact-convention-human-rights/right-to-privacy">The European Convention on Human Rights</a> agrees, as does the<a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"> UN Declaration of Human Rights</a>.</p>
<p>That said, such legislation is often thought of as targeting the potential for governmental overreach. This may not be the primary concern for the majority of us in a world where it&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/04/the-age-of.html">primarily capitalists</a> that are capable of and desperate to know what we&rsquo;re up to (largely so that they can change it). In any case, governments <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">often</a> <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2021/07/governments-are-using-spyware-on-citizens-can-they-be-stopped">rely</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/16/google-geofence-warrants-law-enforcement-privacy/">on</a>  the technology capitalists for their surveillance work; there&rsquo;s no clear dividing line.</p>
<p>Some people are only able to thrive - perhaps only stay alive - because they have privacy. This isn&rsquo;t only theoretical. The LGBTQ community, particularly within countries with outrageously repressive laws and norms around the subject, provides <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/2782/communities-risk-how-security-fails-are-endangering-lbgtiq-community">an obvious example</a>.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279270/lgbtq-dating-apps-egypt-illegal-human-rights">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As LGBTQ Egyptians flock to apps like Grindr, Hornet, and Growlr, they face an unprecedented threat from police and blackmailers who use the same apps to find targets. The apps themselves have become both evidence of a crime and a means of resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might not be the case for more privileged folk for whom little immediate drama might result if our behaviour or implied thoughts were to be revealed. But when de-valuing the right to privacy on the basis that you don&rsquo;t think that (right now) you have anything to hide from any institution that might wish to surveil you, you also implicitly imperil the right to privacy for other people, for those to whom it may be more acutely important.</p>
<p>Plus rules change. Norms alter. Over in the US, when the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn">Roe vs Wade decision was cruelly overturned</a> some folk who previously may have felt little concern about certain aspects of their data privacy suddenly had a potential new reason to care what happened to the data associated with <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/supreme-court-decision-roe-v-wade-tech-surveillance-pregnancy-abortion-menstrual-period-cycle-tracker-apps-data-evidence-health-providers-agree-terms-conditions-egal-perspectives-subpoenaed-against-legal-action-women-vulnerable-draft-opinion-privacy">period tracking apps</a>.</p>
<p>There have been several instances of, for instance, the data associated with people&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2016/08/how-your-google-searches-can-be-used-against-you-court">web search history</a> or <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/amazon-echo-alexa-evidence-murder-case-a8633551.html">voice assistant usage</a> being used in their legal prosecution. Over here in the UK, the <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk">British Crown Prosecution service</a> makes it clear this is a move both intentional and expanding, <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/about-cps">writing that</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital devices like smart doorbells, dashcam footage, car GPS systems and even Amazon Alexas are providing increasingly more evidence in criminal trials, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in a speech today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some will argue that this is a good thing, making it easier to prove criminal behaviour, more likely that victims of crime will see justice. Others will fear that, even so, this may not be the only use your personal data will be put to.</p>

			 <p>Inevitably after attending any type of show that features something even vaguely sciencey the list of books that I simply must read expands.</p>
<p>Here, as a service to anyone else similarly afflicted, is a list of books from as many of the speakers from the recent <a href="https://live.newscientist.com/">New Scientist Live show</a> as I could quickly find.</p>
<p>The organisation of the show is such that you can&rsquo;t possibly attend more than <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/10/13/new-scientist-live.html">a few of the talks</a> whilst you&rsquo;re there, but that&rsquo;s no reason to let unread books from people you could in theory have listened to pile up on one&rsquo;s shelf of course.</p>
<p>Many of these distinguished folk have written several books. In those cases I picked a single one based on either which title it seemed they were implicitly or explicitly sales-pitching the most in their talk, or if not applicable, then perhaps their most recent or, just the one that caught my eye.</p>

<p>It is a battle evident in the psyche of many partnered people, and especially so in midlife. It shows itself, even within a happy long-term relationship, in the crystal-clear desire to be left alone.</p>
<p>To be allowed to work undisturbed, to perhaps write or paint or just sit at the computer, to think or nap or to choose to spend a day as one requires. To let things live where one has left them; to visit friends alone without guilt; to be who one is, without that being a daily source of irritation to someone else.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780230757073">Fall of Giants</a> by Ken Follett.</p>
<p>This is the first book of Ken Follet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Century Trilogy&rdquo; which sets out to allow the reader to follow the stories of five families through the highs and lows of the twentieth-century. This one covers the start of the century, up to and including the immediate aftermath of the First World War.</p>
<p>Amongst various other socio-cultural changes there&rsquo;s big political change in the air, from the Russian revolution, to demands for women&rsquo;s rights - including the British campaign for the right to vote, for workers rights and more. The &ldquo;fallen giants&rdquo; include the aristocracy, the royalty and perhaps even a couple of  nations, at least in terms of how people thought about them at the start of the century.</p>
<p>Whilst primarily a work of fiction telling a made-up story of families that didn&rsquo;t exist, we do see some historical figures pop their heads up. Several are from the political class, inculding Lloyd George, Woodrow Wilson, Vladimir Lenin and, inevitably, Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Supposedly Follet has made every effort when it comes to the actually-real folk to ensure that the events they&rsquo;re involved in either did happen or could realistically have happened. What they say, how they behave, where they are are all intended to be plausible. Personally, this feels usefully educational to my limited knowledge of early twentieth century history, but there&rsquo;s also a risk of course that I&rsquo;ll mix up fiction with reality in my mind, although the danger feels less acute than with <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/03/092634.html">The Crown</a>.</p>
<p>The five families represent folk from across the class spectrum. One of the major themes is the struggle of the working class to achieve liberation, whether via politics or other methods. We start off with Billy Williams, a child, who&rsquo;s sent off to work down a Welsh coal mine. Next up we sight the aristocracy, Earl Fitzherbert, who owns the said mine amongst other lands. His sister inadvertently falls in love with a German man, which is to prove problematic given the rise of Hitler and the consequent looming conflict. Over in Russia, two orphans struggle against poverty in very different ways, orphans in part because the Russian aristocracy executed their father.</p>
<p>Throughout, we see how these families live, meet and mix in ways both predictable and not, as they thrive, struggle, rise and fall through a seemingly quite realistic replica of our twentieth century.</p>
<p>Sure, the written form of the book is apparently nearly 1000 pages long, which is something that I&rsquo;d usually find tremendously off-putting. And I can sometimes find historical fiction somewhat dry. But not in this case; it proved fairly gripping as I happily listened to the 30-and-a-half hour long audio edition at a more rapid rate than I usually manage to listen to audiobooks. And in the end, the next two books in the trilogy, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101591437?title=Winter+of+the+World&amp;author=Ken+Follett&amp;cover_id=181319">Winter of the World</a> (apparently mostly covering the 1933-1949 period) and <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780698160576?title=Edge+of+Eternity&amp;author=Ken+Follett&amp;cover_id=181327">Edge of Eternity</a> (1969-1989) have surely made it to my want-to-read list.</p>

			 <p>Looks like the next UK Conservative leader stands a good chance of being a right-wing weirdo.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/09/kemi-badenoch-or-robert-jenrick-will-be-tory-leader-after-cleverly-eliminated">surprise outcome of the leadership election</a>, the two prospects MPs are putting to party members are Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. That&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>The desire from Cleverly to see his party getting to be a bit less weird - perhaps in reference to a <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/weird-republicans-democrats-harris-walz-trump-vance">current attack line</a> against the US Republicans  - seems to have failed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the party&rsquo;s conference in Birmingham last week, Cleverly had urged party members to be &ldquo;more normal&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same kind of subject was echoed by Nadine Dorries in one of her rare good opinions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nadine Dorries, the Tory former cabinet minister, said on X: &ldquo;MPs had one job. To be normal and vote for the person who is best placed to lead you. It really wasn&rsquo;t hard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, some in Labour are apparently excited at the prospect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a jokey reference to the government&rsquo;s donations row, a Labour MP asked: &ldquo;Does Tory leadership result need to be declared as a gift?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>May we never forget that back in the early days, before Google decided to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/google-dont-be-evil-code-conduct-removed-alphabet-a8361276.html">not <em>not</em> be evil</a>, its founders were very well aware of the perils of what later came to be the funding model behind their own search engine.</p>
<p>The classic citation for this is Brin and Page&rsquo;s 1998 paper &ldquo;<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</a>&rdquo; wherein they write that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That paper&rsquo;s authors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Sergey Brin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page">Larry Page</a>, are of course the founders of Google.</p>
<p>Their written conclusions sound perfectly plausible to me. They&rsquo;re certainly logical. But, words are just words, and all these years later, does the product they mention as being &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; exist? It&rsquo;s certainly not their own product, Google Search, which today operates along precisely the opposite lines. If that crucial product is one out there, it certainly isn&rsquo;t very mainstream.</p>
<p>To be clear, there certainly do exist today search engines that aren&rsquo;t funded by advertisers. But the ones I personally know of are still very much commercial, plus have pretty negligible shares of the search market.</p>
<p><a href="http://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> is one such example. They make their money via users paying them between $5 and $25 per month for a subscription directly, rather than by taking payments for advertising bundled in with the revenue associated with subtle expropriation of each user&rsquo;s behavioural data. This of course changes the incentives for the creators of the search engine, probably in a very beneficial way for the most part. But it also limits its audience to people who can both afford a subscription and are willing to pay for such a thing.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781610395700">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this book on my top priority reading list ever since it came out in 2018. It still somehow took me five years to get to it. But I&rsquo;m glad I did - I wasn&rsquo;t at all disappointed with my belated reading of it. I&rsquo;ve come away thinking that something along these lines should be essential reading for almost everyone who has to navigate today&rsquo;s technological society.</p>
<p>This particular book is rather wordy and academic-sounding. Its style might not be accessible or interesting to everyone trying to make their way through today&rsquo;s chaotic and busy world. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for someone to bring out a shorter and simpler version. Or to communicate its message via a different media. The Netflix documentary on Facebook - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a>&rdquo; - contained a small subset of similar ideas for instance and was surely a lot more accessible to a lot more people. But also, necessarily, that much shallower. This book is for anyone who is interested in digging deeper into what&rsquo;s happening, why, and why it matters.</p>
<p>In any case, I feel that the ideas within this book very important to understand if you want to know what&rsquo;s being done to you and why, each time you use the internet. Or, for that matter, an increasing amount of the time when you aren&rsquo;t aware that you&rsquo;re anywhere near the internet.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think you&rsquo;d get a decent summary from reading just the introduction if the full thing is too heavy going.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I&rsquo;ll note that the content plays heavily into my pre-existing biases as to the perils of big tech, particularly the mainstream social media companies. So perhaps some of my enthusiasm comes from the comfortable feeling one gets when reading something you already heavily agree with in many ways. But whilst one might fairly accuse it of over-hyping the current impact of surveillance capitalism I do think many of the basic ideas, the theories behind the system, are fairly indisputable and critical to document and publicise. It&rsquo;s important to know what the surveillance capitalists want to do to us and why - even if you don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re actually all that effective at doing it just yet. They&rsquo;re unlikely to get any <em>worse</em> at what they do over time, unless we intervene.</p>
<p>Anyway, the general premise is that, as we know capitalism changes and adapts over time. The current version we&rsquo;re heavily enmeshed within can be described as the titular &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Living in an the era of surveillance capitalism, the digital realm has permeated very heavily into our lives. It has redefined how things work and what things are acceptable far faster than we&rsquo;ve had a chance to think about whether these changes are desirable or not. Famously, the big tech companies like to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/move-fast-break-things-facebook-motto/">move fast and break things</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is of course a problem if the &ldquo;things&rdquo; they are breaking include you as an individual and society as a whole.  Without a swift re-evaluation and consequent serious action, Zuboff claims that our emerging &ldquo;information civilisation&rdquo; poses a substantial threat to some of our most fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which this plays out can be swiftly summarised via this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;our lives are unilaterally rendered as data, expropriated, and repurposed in new forms of social control, all of it in the service of others’ interests and in the absence of our awareness or means of combat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digging deeper here - but not nearly as deep as the book does - the underlying philosophy starts with the claim by surveillance capitalists that they have the right to surveil and ingest our human experience in service of converting it into behavioural data.</p>
<p>Some of this data might be used to improve the products they sell. This is perhaps fair enough, maybe even a net positive for us, and is how things <em>used</em> to work. But ever since Google discovered how profitable this data can be in the marketplace, the rest of our surveilled and datafied human experience is translated into a &ldquo;behavioural surplus&rdquo;, to be used exclusively in the interests of the company who snaffled it up in the first place.</p>
<p>The companies concerned then use machine intelligence processes to manufacture a &ldquo;prediction product&rdquo; from our behavioural data. The prediction product aims, on the basis of knowing what you&rsquo;re doing, thinking or feeling right now, to be able to predict what you&rsquo;ll do in the future.</p>
<p>These prediction products are traded in an entirely separate and new marketplace - the &ldquo;behavioural futures market&rdquo;. Selling this information about what we&rsquo;ve done, what we&rsquo;re doing and what we&rsquo;ll do in the future is extremely profitable for the companies that extracted it.</p>
<p>The author reports that it was Google that first discovered the economic value in this. Soon afterwards Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and the rest of big tech followed. It&rsquo;s now become the default way that companies offering online services are funded now, everything from tiny start ups to mega corporations. Consequently, if we want to lead an effective life, we often have no reasonable alternative but to participate, to allow this to be done to us.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the predictions the companies make about us is what makes them valuable. Increased accuracy means increased profits, for which the drive is, naturally under capitalism, insatiable. Thus these companies feel compelled to acquire and infer more and more data about us, which now includes our voices, our emotions and our personalities.</p>
<p>Harrowing as that might be, it&rsquo;s not where the danger ends. There was a realisation that the most accurate predictive behavioural data is that which is created when the organisations concerned directly alter our behaviour. If they intervene, nudging us to make decisions in line with their interests, then their predictions become more accurate and hence more profitable. Think of how the fun Pokémon Go game ended up sending us to locations that just happened to correspond to restaurants that paid them or how Facebook expropriates a huge amount of data from us and our friends in order to allow its advertisers to more effectively influence us to buy their products.</p>
<p>In doing this, these companies are exercising &ldquo;instrumentarian power&rdquo;; a power that knows and shapes human behaviour towards other people&rsquo;s goals. The end goal is effectively to automate us. Whilst an earlier time&rsquo;s industrial society was imagined as a well-functioning machine, instrumentarian society can be imagined as a human simulation of a machine learning system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of the typical assurances that machines can be designed to be more like human beings and therefore less threatening, Schmidt and Thrun argue just the opposite: it is necessary for people to become more machine-like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original digital dream - that being digitally connected is intrinsically pro-social, inclusive and tends towards the democratisation of knowledge is dead. Capitalism no longer feeds solely on human labour, but has expanded to feed on every aspect of the human experience.</p>
<p>How was this allowed to happen? Basically because few people understood what was going on. &ldquo;Cyberspace&rdquo;, where it all began, was an uncharted and fairly lawless territory. Google et al. carried out deliberately secretive and misleading activities that were anyway so new, complex and illegible to the vast majority of us that even if we&rsquo;d somehow known what they were up to we wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have realised its implications.</p>
<p>And all this was sold to us as a freedom, as an emancipation. Who <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> want free access to the entire world&rsquo;s information? Who doesn&rsquo;t desire to connect to their friends upon demand at the click of a button? Who would hate having the ability to publicise their thoughts, worries and concerns to the world at large? Who doesn&rsquo;t want a digital assistant or convenient online tools to help them get through the struggles and torments of modern life?</p>
<p>At last, herald true personalisation is here to soothe us. Someone - well, something - that recognises us for who were are, acknowledges our interests, never says no, is always available.</p>
<p>But, inevitably, behind the scenes, solving these issues is not the primary purpose that these products were created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surveillance capitalists quickly realized that they could do anything they wanted, and they did. They dressed in the fashions of advocacy and emancipation, appealing to and exploiting contemporary anxieties, while the real action was hidden offstage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To Facebook et al. we are not customers. There&rsquo;s no economic exchange, price or profit directly taking place between us and Google when we do a web search. Contra to a commonly held idea, we are not even the product. We are merely the source of the raw material that the surveillance capitalists need, the behavioural surplus. The real customers of these companies are the organisations that buy our data from them in the behavioural futures markets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;individuals are definitively cast as the means to others’ market ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These techniques also came to the fore in an era of a neoliberal ideology that resisted the idea of putting controls on businesses. Furthermore, the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US also made the state and its population prioritise the benefits of surveillance over its drawbacks. After all, outside of specific examples like China, most governments often do not have the resources or skills to carry out mass sophisticated surveillance operations of the kind done by the private surveillance capitalists. Instead they&rsquo;re reliant on, and jealous of, big tech. The US government alternates its time between funding Google and begging for bits of their data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous asymmetry in knowledge and power here. Surveillance capitalists know everything about us but deliberately use methods that mean we cannot know very much about them. Our rights to privacy are not respected. But they&rsquo;re not destroyed; just redistributed. Surveillance capitalism claims the right to privacy whilst depriving us of ours.</p>
<p>At the end of the day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information.</p>
<p>One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with the information concealed in its networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dynamics of power under industrial capitalism are shifted from past eras.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the twenty-first century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As are the fundamental risks to our very existence as we know it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and now threatens to cost us the Earth, an information civilization shaped by surveillance capitalism and its new instrumentarian power will thrive at the expense of human nature and will threaten to cost us our humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not of course that surveillance capitalism doesn&rsquo;t <em>also</em> flourish at the expense of nature. The incredible power consumption of, for instance, modern day artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/">makes that clear</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This “seventh extinction” will not be of nature but of what has been held most precious in human nature: the will to will, the sanctity of the individual, the ties of intimacy, the sociality that binds us together in promises, and the trust they breed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing about this was inevitable. The technology didn&rsquo;t create the system. The problem comes from the very logic of surveillance capitalism, which directs where the technology goes. The nefarious processes we&rsquo;re talking about were deliberately created to promote the commercial ends of the companies that foist them upon us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology can never be isolated from economics and society; they&rsquo;re always economic means to an end, not ends in themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise these attempts to surveil and automate us are not to be explained by individual &ldquo;bad people&rdquo; or a conspiracy. Firing Zuckerberg, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mark-zuckerberg-cant-be-fired-as-meta-facebook-ceo-2022-11">even if it wasn&rsquo;t impossible</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t fix the system. The actions taken by surveillance capitalists and the resulting harms are an obvious and inevitable consequence of the logic of accumulation under surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so long ago that US society was appalled at the idea of mass behaviour modification techniques. Admittedly they were generally envisaged as being carried out by the state. There haven&rsquo;t been an equivalent reaction in more modern times to the same practices being used by private companies who simply seek to get ever more rich, ever more powerful.</p>
<p>This remains true, despite the intent of these companies to deprive us of various rights we previously claimed as inviolable. These include essentially any that require our individual autonomy and agency to be respected. Zuboff terms these as being challenges to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sanctity of the individual.</li>
<li>the right to individual sovereignty.</li>
<li>the right to the future tense.</li>
<li>the right to sanctuary.</li>
</ul>
<p>The loss of these rights mean democracy is also under threat. Democratic engagement requires individuals to be able to exercise autonomous moral judgement and self-determination. If we lose the latter then we lose the former.</p>
<p>There are at least 3 fundamental differences between surveillance capitalism and the capitalisms that came before.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Surveillance capitalists insist that they, and only they, should have unfettered freedom and knowledge. The theory of capitalism was built by its theorists on the back of 2 assumptions: firstly that markets are unknowable, and secondly that it&rsquo;s this unsurmountable ignorance that means market actors must be given freedom of action. This is Adam Smith&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand">invisible hand</a> at play - the butcher cannot possibly know everything about every potential customer and their relationship to the market and society. But by having the freedom to work in their own interest they end up contributing, unknowingly, to the efficient allocation of resources; a positive result for society. This fundamental assumption breaks down as one side of any transaction - the Google side - gains ever more perfect knowledge but refuses to give up any of its freedoms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traditionally capitalism has involved reciprocities. The author seems to me perhaps a little forgiving of prior power dynamics at times, although they mention the shareholder value movement as partly disrupting this. But it&rsquo;s true that ideas around reciprocation were fundamental to the origin of capitalism, such as Adam Smith&rsquo;s argument that price increases must be balanced with wage increases. However, today&rsquo;s hyperscale surveillance capitalists don&rsquo;t need or want to feel any obligation around reciprocities. As individuals, we are neither their customers, nor do they rely on very many of us as workers. These companies tend to have relatively small numbers of staff, all of which are drawn from very exclusive strata of population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historically capitalism has been greatly in favour of an individualistic vision of the world, insisting on sanctity of individual liberties - often to a problematic level in my view. Traditional capitalism&rsquo;s vision of society is a set of individual agents freely transacting according to their will. In particular it loathed the idea of a collectivist society; one where planning and control is used to produce a result previously ordained by someone or something, which would necessarily come at the expense of an individual&rsquo;s freedom to do exactly as they choose. However, surveillance capitalism&rsquo;s desire is in fact for a collectivist society, one that they organise, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;radically indifferent&rdquo; to our own personal interests and predilections. It&rsquo;s a world where each of us is tuned and nudged to behave in line with previously ordained plans - plans that are solely in the interest of the surveillance capitalists.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The wealth of these companies means they can plough vast resources into recruiting the finest minds of our times and investing in infrastructure at levels that one would have thought would be more appropriate to efforts to solving world hunger and the in-progress environmental catastrophe. But no, in the real world, the most incredible rewards are given to the few people who have the privilege, education and ability to use of this data to make us&hellip;click on more adverts.</p>
<p>So, for those of us who aren&rsquo;t keen on being surveilled and subconsciously coerced to do things we otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have done, what can we do?</p>
<p>Opting out seems the obvious thing at a glance. Don&rsquo;t use services that surveil and seek to modify your behaviour. However, in reality, that&rsquo;s nigh on impossible to do without dramatically affecting our lives. The internet is truly rife with this technology and using the internet is fairly critical for leading an effective life these days. And that&rsquo;s before we get to all the surveillance architecture that&rsquo;s hidden in physical public spaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prediction imperative transforms the things that we have into things that have us in order that it might render the range and richness of our world, our homes, and our bodies as behaving objects for its calculations and fabrications on the path to profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a time when you searched Google, but now Google searches you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tension between a sense of knowing surveillance capitalism should be resisted but finding it almost impossible to do so if we want to have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life tends to result in us becoming cynical, resigned, and just learning to put up with it.</p>
<p>We can of course attempt to hide. I myself use a wide range of tools that aim to preserve a certain degree of privacy on the internet - tracker blockers, ad blockers, VPNs, special browsers, encryption, all that kind of stuff. A <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3201/ad-blocking/">surprisingly high</a> (to me) number of people also take these precautions.</p>
<p>There also exist physical items of relevance, such as clothes that aim to interfere with the ability of outdoor cameras to apply facial recognition to track where you go, what you do.</p>
<p>But these whilst these solutions, or &ldquo;counter-declarations&rdquo; can help some individual people with their individual situations, they unfairly and impracticably put the onus to act on us as individuals. These efforts can sometimes can feel as exhausting to do as surveillance capitalism is to endure. Instead we need action at a society level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the individual alone cannot shoulder the burden of justice, any more than an individual worker in the first years of the twentieth century could bear the burden of fighting for fair wages and working conditions. Those twentieth-century challenges required collective action, and so do our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These actions would include changes in public opinion leading to legislation and jurisprudence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s already been attempts to use monopoly or privacy legislation to address some of the harms. Whilst acknowledging that these are important facets of the issue, the author feels these efforts miss the primary point. The real harm here originates from the practice of the &ldquo;rendering of our lives as data&rdquo; in order to increase the control others have over us in the first place. What they argue for is legislation but far more widely scoped and interpreted. Something that&rsquo;s a much more fundamental challenge to what surveillance capitalists do.</p>
<p>Zuboff refers to this as being a &lsquo;synthetic declaration&rsquo;, meaning something that imposes a new framework, redefining the facts of the matter, spelling out what we want our future to be. Likely components would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening our democratic institutions.</li>
<li>constructing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_movement">double movement</a>.</li>
<li>harnessing digital technologies in ways that help us to live an effective life and maintain a democratic social order.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> might one day be seen as green shoots to move in this direction with its requirement that companies justify their data activities. But at the time of the book being written it remained to be seen what its real impact would be. Notably, Zuboff argues that this would be dependent how it&rsquo;s interpreted by society and the law, which is more important than the specific text of the legislation.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s been place for a few years and, hey, surveillance capitalism still does what it does, flourishing to an astonishing degree, albeit with slightly reduced rights (that it&rsquo;s battling to regain) <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/04/meta-faces-new-limits-on-ad-targeting-court-of-justice-cjeu-schrems/">in Europe</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Zuboff concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not OK to have to hide in your own life; it is not normal.
&hellip;
It is not OK for every move, emotion, utterance, and desire to be catalogued, manipulated, and then used to surreptitiously herd us through the future tense for the sake of someone else’s profit
&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;it is up to us to use our knowledge, to regain our bearings, to stir others to do the same, and to found a new beginning</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Being somewhat drawn to the Covid-doomer persuasion myself, I appreciate <a href="https://blog.miljko.org/2024/09/28/the-forever-plague.html">the reminder from  Miloš Miljković</a> that we should step back and consider the context of both what we know about other viruses,  and the impact of things that are associated with, but not unique to, Covid - such as having to be hospitalised - before assigning uniquely nightmarish impacts to this particular condition.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more pertinent to consider, what we don&rsquo;t actually know. There are a ton of valuable studies out there on the subject, but as the article notes, oftentimes they&rsquo;re not constructed in a way that would allow us to tease apart the special impact of Covid-19 vs being ill in some other way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there are two things that could be happening here.</p>
<p>Either a humanity-ending event occurred somewhere near the end of 2021 and we are living a somewhat prolonged but inevitable decline in which so many people will have symptoms of long covid that civilization as we know it will end (queue &ldquo;the Forever Plague&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, we experienced a once-in-a generation spread of a new virus &ndash; new to us but something humanity has had to deal with throughout its existence &ndash; at a time when we have the means to analyze <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-023-00878-2">its genome</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03767-x">our genome</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00630-8">its proteins</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01475-z">our proteins</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-021-00249-2">the cells it infects</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01131-y">our cells responding to the infection</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00698-4">the microbiome</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06043-2">the food</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05049-6">the water</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39419-z">the air</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30698-6">the animals</a> and yes, even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01037-3">art</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure that long Covid et al <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> an actual catastrophe. It indisputably is catastrophic at an individual level for certain unlucky people. I know some of them. So many of us do. It can be devastating. But Miljković&rsquo;s points are useful to consider when thinking about how to put the impact of Covid in the context of everything else that goes on in our world.</p>
<p>Getting the baseline right is always so critical to thinking about the impact of anything, especially when it concerns big scary impacts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/03/more-events-in.html">previously saw</a> how Twitter/X was banned in Brazil on the basis that Elon Musk had been picking arguments with the authorities over there after his company was asked to suspend the accounts of certain users. Musk claimed that the judge who made this demand was making &ldquo;illegal orders to censor his political opponents&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/06/elon-musk-free-speech-twitter-will-treat-cisgender-slur">self-proclaimed &ldquo;free-speech-absolutist&rdquo;</a> Musk presumably decided personal wealth was more important than his claimed &ldquo;principles&rdquo;, or someone over at X has managed to make him to so - or maybe he just woke up in a different mood. Anyway, he&rsquo;s capitulated,  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/21/elon-musk-backs-down-in-his-fight-with-brazilian-judges-to-restore-x">deciding to comply with Brazil&rsquo;s requirements</a> to appoint a local legal representative, remove some users and pay fines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not new news that his principles have always been for sale, whether financially or ideologically.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/25/elon-musk-and-free-speech-track-record-not-encouraging.html"> CNBC reminds us</a> that whilst he may believe in free speech for himself - isn&rsquo;t that always the way with these folk?  - he&rsquo;s not so keen on it for his employees, journalists, bloggers, analysts, researchers, regulators or even some of his customers. Oh and you&rsquo;re not supposed to use the words &ldquo;cis&rdquo; or &ldquo;cisgender&rdquo; on his platform.</p>
<p>And neither has X under his leadership been sanctuary for all content, untouched by moderator hand. Which is, to be clear, a good thing in general - but also makes his previous response to Brazil rather hypocritical. In the first 6 months of his leadership, Twitter both received way more government orders than it had in the preceding year and also took action to comply with a far higher percentage of them.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/elon-musk-twitter-government-orders/">Rest of World</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data, drawn from Twitter’s reports to the Lumen database, shows that between October 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023, Twitter received a total of 971 requests from governments and courts. These requests included orders to remove controversial posts, as well as demands that Twitter produce private data to identify anonymous accounts. Twitter reported that it fully complied in 808 of those requests, and partially complied in 154 other cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course if you&rsquo;re an extremist that happens to lean the same way as he does politically then you&rsquo;re all good. Witness <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/elon-musk-far-right-twitter-content-moderation-censorship_n_638526efe4b09a86b1b63a86">the return</a> of some very unpleasant accounts to X since he bought it and the consequent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/2/23489808/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-increase-content-moderation">increase in hate speech</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">Charlie Warzel wrote</a> in his Atlantic newsletter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He has reinstated legions of accounts that were previously banned for violating Twitter’s rules and has emboldened trolls, white-nationalist accounts, and January 6 defendants.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>A social-media platform will always reflect the values of its owners&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everyone dislikes this of course;. Musk&rsquo;s command-and-control is an ideologically charged policy that goes far enough in the right direction that far-right groups are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-far-right-nominates-elon-muskfree-speech-award/">attempting to nominate</a> their hero Musk on the basis of his free speech claims for the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakharov_Prize"> Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought</a>, an award that has been previously won by the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai">Malala Yousafzai</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">Kofi Annan</a>.</p>

			 <p>Honestly it&rsquo;s probably a losing battle, but if you want to try then organisations like <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/23/tech/social-media-ai-data-opt-out/index.html">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">Wired</a>  have guides as to how to opt out of letting the big social networks strip-mine your personal data in order to sell it to any rich-enough enterprise interested in &lsquo;improving&rsquo; their AI model.</p>
<p>Except Reddit, because apparently there&rsquo;s no way to prevent that.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn&rsquo;t help retrospectively. Many companies have already sold or ingested your output, usually without asking. Making the changes outlined in the guides above won&rsquo;t undo that.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/28/hidden-figures-reminds.html">Hidden Figures reminds us that not all 1960s NASA geniuses were Serious White Men</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📽️ Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/hidden-figures-2016">Hidden Figures</a>.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/forgotten-black-women-mathematicians-who-helped-win-wars-and-send-astronauts-space-180960393/">real life events</a>, this is the story of 3 computers. This was in the era when to be a computer was to have human rather than artificial intelligence. It was simply the job title of someone who computes. Here we&rsquo;re talking about mathematicians.</p>
<p>We learn about the lives of three such computers. In this case they happen to be Black women who work at NASA on critical tasks such as manually computing flight paths. Computers there were amongst the lower status technical jobs - &ldquo;do these sums, we&rsquo;re not telling you why&rdquo;. In an era of rife sexism many computers were women and stood little chance of career development, respect or acknowledgement.</p>
<p>It was also an era of extremely overt racism in the United States (amongst other places). It was hard to find decent jobs if you were Black, or for that matter to access the education that would let one develop any skills needed for technical work. Segregation was the norm. Black people were unable to, for instance, use the same bathrooms as White people, attend the same schools, drink or eat in shared spaces and so on - all obstacles which these women certainly faced, amongst so many others.</p>
<p>Specifically in this film, we learn about the lives of Mary Jackson , Katherine Goble Johnson and Dorothy Vaughan, as they use their considerable talents towards the service of the incredible developments surrounding space flight that happened in the 1960s - particularly in this story the facilitation of John Glenn to be <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/60-years-ago-john-glenn-the-first-american-to-orbit-the-earth-aboard-friendship-7/">the first American to orbit Earth</a> - whilst simultaneously battling a system that didn&rsquo;t want them there, and individuals that resented their very existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on true story - primarily <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062363619?title=Hidden+Figures&amp;author=Margot+Lee+Shetterly&amp;cover_id=179074">the non-fiction book</a> of the same name. So the three named protagonists are real people. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures#Historical_accuracy">a good amount of artistic license</a> was applied, occasionally somewhat controversially. However it&rsquo;s an important film to, if nothing else, remind us that the history of NASA isn&rsquo;t all about clever serious White men. Incredible contributions were made by others even whilst Black people, women, and most especially Black women had to fight far harder than that demographic for any kind of acceptance no matter what talents and capabilities they had.</p>

			 <p>Somewhat bewildered at what&rsquo;s going on between the ultra famous web content management system that powers a good chunk of the internet, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> (well, its CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a>) and <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a> - a service that hosts Wordpress sites.</p>
<p>The former has been virulently criticising the latter all of a sudden. In one blog post <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/">Mullenweg writes</a> that WP Engine is &ldquo;a cancer to Wordpress&rdquo; seemingly for turning off the revision history feature. <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/">In another</a> he implies that they&rsquo;re a &ldquo;parasitic entity&rdquo;. I understand he made similarly negative comments in a recent conference speech.</p>
<p>And now WP Engine publicly shared <a href="https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf">a cease and desist letter</a> they sent which portrays Wullenweg&rsquo;s comments as being some kind of petty revenge for WP Engine resisting an extortion attempt to cough up some vast sum of money.</p>
<p>Hard to know what to believe. I hope it&rsquo;s not that Wullenweg has developed a strange revenge obsession. He is that very rare thing, a big tech CEO who in recent times I still had substantial respect for. I suspect there are very many hosts out there that &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; Wordpress without giving anything back - which is a real and important problem, but not one that as far as I know is specific to WP Engine.</p>

<p>Oddly specific rule. If gifts are a problem, and they probably are, then why not stop taking all gifts in this context?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like where I work. We&rsquo;re told to decline all gifts from third parties we have, or may in the future have, any kind of business relationship with above a certain nominal cash value to avoid, at the very least, the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p>I forget the threshold, but it&rsquo;s low.  Basically enough that someone can buy you a coffee during a meeting, but not, for instance, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-wallpaper-gold-flat-carrie-invoice-b2118185.html">£2260 worth of gold wallpaper</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s interesting, if somewhat predictable, what passes muster for making it to the status of a wannabe British political scandal in more normal, less <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/06/uk/boris-johnson-scandals-intl/index.html">actually scandalous</a>, times. The latest example I know of is the &ldquo;<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/starmer-attacked-for-petty-removal-of-thatcher-portrait-from-no-10-13205761">outrage</a>&rdquo; at Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvy87wgjzvo">moving a painting</a> to another room in his house.</p>
<p>Feigned outrage? Very likely, although the modern-day Conservatives do seem <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/09/15/liz-truss-is.html">in absolute thrall</a> to the subject of the painting in question, Margaret Thatcher. The whole thing kind of feels <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/21/the-era-of.html">Britishcore</a> to me, although that may be my bias.</p>
<p>In any case, in the end Starmer seemed to have even felt the need to take the time to explain himself - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24570285.i-like-landscapes--starmer-defends-removing-thatcher-portrait/">I like landscapes</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Compare that Very British Infraction to, for example, the recent example across the pond where the Republican nominee for the governorship of North Carolina <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/19/politics/kfile-mark-robinson-black-nazi-pro-slavery-porn-forum/index.html">was revealed</a> to have made some rather disturbing comments on a porn chatsite whilst, in public, banging on about &ldquo;protecting women&rdquo; in all the usual US culture war ways.</p>

<p>Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law</p>

			 <p>I believe <a href="https://json.blog/">Jason</a> has previously noted on his blog that new phones are boring - although I can&rsquo;t find the specific post. I guess it&rsquo;s not just me being older and more tired that made me feel this way.</p>
<p>This may be no bad thing overall in that the excitement upon new phone releases many years ago likely led to a ton of unnecessary e-waste. Per the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/repair-not-recycle-tackle-ewaste-circular-economy-smartphones/">World Economic Forum</a>, keeping your phone for longer is better even than recycling its components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While recycling smartphones is required when phones truly reach end of life stage, keeping phones in use for longer (and therefore minimizing the number which actually need to be recycled) keeps materials in use for longer, reduces waste streams, and means less energy is required for recycling processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The greenest smartphone is the one you already own&rdquo; says a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/11/business/phone-upgrade-environmental-impact-climate/index.html">CNN article</a> that lists a few options you have rather than binning your actually still fine phone.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m more than happy to keep my phone until it simply doesn&rsquo;t work any more, typically several years. Even my inner tech geek doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m missing out.</p>
<p>The companies that produce these phones seem to have picked up on these vibes and are naturally desperate to make us think their phones are new and special.</p>
<p>An advert for the new Google Pixel 9 phone feels like it&rsquo;s been continuously showing in my household. Much as I&rsquo;m loathe to spread the propaganda, here it is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The magic is back</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember when all phones did pretty much the same stuff until they didn&rsquo;t?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is a new phone that can do magical new things we&rsquo;ve never seen before. Except the two examples that they attempt to dazzle us with are in fact not new things at all. My several-years-old basic model phone has done them for quite some time.</p>
<p>Sticking pins on a map of your locality corresponding to well reviewed restaurants has been a basic function of mapping apps for years. Here is me asking the same kind of question of <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/">Google Maps</a> - done with my voice even if you can&rsquo;t tell that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And it works fine - or at least as fine as I imagine it works on the fancy new phone.</p>
<p>Granted, maybe the Pixel 9 does it in a different way behind the scenes. I have no idea. But I also don&rsquo;t care about that unless the results are dramatically better. Of course if they, like many others companies, decided to shove generative AI into everything no matter how unnecessary then I&rsquo;d imagine the results might not be better at all. Witness <a href="https://youtu.be/9K4UyRA-6Yw?feature=shared&amp;t=297">Apple&rsquo;s awkward disclaimer</a> on the the generative AI output on its new phone - &ldquo;Check important info for mistakes&rdquo;. That feels like work.</p>
<p>The second task Google demonstrate - having AI &ldquo;watch&rdquo; a video and answer a question about it - is a bit of a new innovation in terms of only having been available in the mainstream for the past few years, really since the advent of generative AI as far as I know. But it&rsquo;s wrong to imply that only the Pixel 9 can do it when in fact the majority of modern smartphones can do it.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day this is software thing, and likely a cloud thing at that. I imagine there&rsquo;s several services out there that have enabled the same sort of task for a while now. Personally I&rsquo;m a user of the <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> app which, via its &ldquo;Ghostreader&rdquo; function, has a similar ability to let you &ldquo;ask questions&rdquo; of Youtube videos. It&rsquo;s not a feature I ever use - typically if I have loaded up a video it&rsquo;s because I would actually like to watch a video, although I understand there are valid use-cases where you might want to do otherwise - but it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the results of me asking for references from a random Youtube video that contains some.</p>

			 <p>In what sounds like a plot of a fairly implausible science fiction story, hundreds of pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-pager-explosion-e9493409a0648b846fdcadffdb02d71e">exploded yesterday</a> in what appears to be an very well coordinated, very sophisticated, attack against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah">the organisation</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whatever one might think of Hezbollah, some definitely innocent victims got caught up in the assault. At least two of the <a href="https://apnews.com/live/lebanon-syria-pagers-hezbollah-updates">12 people known to have died</a> as a result were young children. Around 3,000 people were injured.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still very early days, but the leading theory of how this could have been carried out looks to be that the pagers' hardware supply chain was interfered with several months ago.</p>
<p>The idea is that small explosive devices may have been inserted next to the pager batteries which were then, months later, remotely detonated via a radio signal.</p>
<p>After all, as a bomb disposal expert noted, a pager already has 3 of the 5 components necessary for an effective explosive device:</p>
<ul>
<li>container</li>
<li>battery</li>
<li>triggering mechanism</li>
<li>detonator</li>
<li>explosive charge</li>
</ul>
<p>Another idea out there is that a hacker, or some previously-infiltrated malware, might have been able to cause the pager batteries to simultaneously overheat, resulting in the devices exploding.</p>
<p>But whilst overheating consumer devices igniting in dangerous circumstances are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2024/09/18/these-four-greek-brothers-run-a-family-empire-of-luxury-hotels-on-mykonos/">a real thing</a>, it seems like experts think that the nature of the explosions likely pointed towards an actual explosive charge being involved.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/10/recent-research-provides.html">Recent research provides some (weak) evidence that labelling menu items with calories might cause harm to some</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/10/recent-research-provides.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-10 08:14:22 &#43;0100">Sep 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Something I feel myself gradually changing my mind on is the ubiquitous labelling of how many calories each food contains on restaurant menus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1893542">basic idea</a> there is that if consumers see that some restaurant food choices options have a very large amount of calories in them then they might be less likely to pick them and, as such, consume fewer calories. This would add up so in the long term they&rsquo;d be less likely put on excess weight with all the concomitant difficulties and <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks">associated conditions</a> which that can entail for some.</p>
<p>There might also be some side-effect benefits too, such as restaurants or food producers providing less calorific meals because they don&rsquo;t want to have a menu full of dishes that exceed the average person&rsquo;s recommended calorie intake in one ago.</p>
<p>I never felt there was much likelihood that the labelling initiative would actually have a big effect on behaviour, let alone health. It always seemed a bit &ldquo;this seems like common sense so let&rsquo;s assume it works&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;we have evidence it works so let&rsquo;s do it&rdquo;. Intuition over evidence; something that unfortunately rife and occasionally dangerous in the world of weight loss amongst others.</p>
<p>Another potential defect came from its seeming centring of the issue of overweight and obesity on the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/eclinm/PIIS2589-5370(22)00138-9.pdf">incorrect</a>,  <a href="https://theconversation.com/weight-stigma-is-a-burden-around-the-world-and-has-negative-consequences-everywhere-155215">stigmatising</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z">counterproductive</a> idea that the large increase in the proportion of people living at higher weights reveals something about the people concerned being ignorant or making &ldquo;bad&rdquo; choices; as though in recent years some evil wizard cast a magical spell over us all that made most of us into foolish greedy gluttons.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is harmful nonsense. It also puts all the &ldquo;blame&rdquo;, for want of a better word, on us as individuals and lets us ignore the structural factors - the things that are harder to think about, more complicated to act on and often less favourable to the profits of associated  businesses - that are so clearly at play.</p>
<p>Since then <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/10/1088">most of the research</a> I&rsquo;ve seen about the various labelling initiatives seems to have confirmed that indeed we&rsquo;re not going to reduce the rate of obesity meaningfully by making it clear how many calories a Big Mac has at the point of sale. It may even be a entirely ineffectual intervention in terms of clinical significance in the long term.</p>
<p>But, my scepticism on its likely efficacy aside, I saw no significant harm in trying it out as a policy - plus have a personal bias towards always wanting more information, more data, to be made available. It felt like it may even have shifted my own eating behaviour a tiny amount.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m privileged enough that I&rsquo;m not someone the policy was ever likely to harm. However, critically, those people may well exist.  And if so, well, calorie labelling <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/calorie-labelling-on-menus-to-be-introduced-in-cafes-restaurants-and-takeaways">is now mandatory in the UK</a>,  a policy that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3">most of the population</a> seems to have been in favour of, so it&rsquo;s a potential concern we should look to mitigate.</p>
<p>The evidence on the harms side is scant so far to be fair, so caveat emptor, but there are hints of adverse effects showing up in some recent research.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3">recent paper by Brealey et al</a> reviewed some of the literature on the impact of food labelling on people that have eating disorders (ED).</p>
<p>They found four studies - listed and summarised as part of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01622-3/tables/1">this table</a> - that use qualitative methods to end up suggesting some potential for harm.</p>
<p>The researchers summarise the results as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recurrent themes describe how calories on menus: can lead to a hyper-fixation on calories, restrict food freedom (meals are chosen for their calorific value rather than what was actually wanted or appropriate for hunger levels), reduce eating out opportunities, increase feelings of anxiety, guilt and shame around food choices, and inhibit ED recovery.</p>
<p>Some participants in these studies expressed anger over the messaging from ‘trusted’ public health authorities on the normalisation of calorie counting, because calorie counting had played a pivotal role in the development of their ED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, the feelings on labelling weren&rsquo;t all negative for the participants concerned. Some saw benefits. Many of them also felt that calorie labelling may overall be a net good thing even if it might put them themselves at risk.</p>
<p>The researchers found only <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350615001201?via%3Dihub">a single study</a> that looked at more objective changes to the symptoms of eating disorders themselves, carried out in a university café. That work found no significant effects of labelling on some symptoms associated with eating disorder, but also came with a large number of limitations - not least that the participants hadn&rsquo;t been formally diagnosed as having a ED.</p>
<p>So honestly the evidence base for harms also seems pretty weak at present. There&rsquo;s simply not enough research out there to form much of a strong conclusion. And almost none that looks at objective rather than subjective harm in terms of ED symptoms - not to suggest that any types of harm should be disregarded.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, given the dearth of evidence that labelling actually leads to much of a relevant change in peoples' behaviour, let alone any positive change in their health, the risk equation shifts someway in the anti-labelling direction when any evidence, even if it&rsquo;s weak, for the potential for harm comes to light.</p>
<p>Without wanting to be a cliché, this is one are where &ldquo;more research is needed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a free <a href="https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI">open-source</a> utility that lets you install, update and uninstall apps via Winget with mere clicks of a mouse.</p>
<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t interest me all that greatly - I rather like typing commands - except for that it comes with a few extra functions that I don&rsquo;t think are available in default Winget. Some I like are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can automatically scan for updates to your existing apps on a schedule. If it finds one it&rsquo;ll notify you so you can choose to update it there and then or not (you can exclude certain apps if you never want to update them).</li>
<li>It can install, update or uninstall multiple selected packages at once - not just &ldquo;one or all&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It can export a list of some or all of your installed applications (plus any custom installation parameters you installed them with). Then in the future you can import that same list again to a different or newly reformatted computer and it&rsquo;ll install everything in it in one fell swoop using the same configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into a different brand of Windows package manger - <a href="https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-package-managers">Chocolatey, Scoop, Pip and more</a> - then the reason the app renamed itself from WingetUI to UniGetUI is because it now supports those package managers too. So you can recursively manage multiple package managers from one place now if that tickles your fancy.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://ismy.blue/">ismy.blue</a> is a weirdly fascinating website whereby it shows you a page that has a background colour of something in the blue-green spectrum - anything between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL hue value</a> of <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/00ff00">120</a> and <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0000FF">240</a>.</p>
<p>You then hit a button depending on whether you&rsquo;d call it blue or green if you were forced to say. The screen refreshes to another place on the same spectrum and you keep making the same blue vs green decision until it narrows down to something approximating what must be the boundary between what you consider to be blue and what you would say is green.</p>
<p>Apparently for me it&rsquo;s somewhere around <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/00ffe9">hue 175</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This means that for me to call something blue it has to be &ldquo;more blue&rdquo; than it would be for 59% of the folk who took the test. So if forced to say whether turquoise was blue or green I apparently be more likely than most to pick green.</p>
<p>My monitor isn&rsquo;t the best and, as the site notes, that sort of thing is one of many factors that are bound affect the results - so it&rsquo;s very much &ldquo;for entertainment purposes only&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On a similar subject, <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/">here&rsquo;s a handy site</a> that converts from hue values to CSS-style hex colour values.</p>

			 <p>In a perfect example of the potential made available by <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">the deleterious effects of bad business models music streaming services</a>, someone <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nc-man-charged-ai-fake-music.html">has been charged</a> with defrauding Spotify to the tune of $10 million dollars.</p>
<p>The allegation is that Michael Smith created a ton of low-effort &ldquo;music&rdquo;  - of course eventually turning to the tools of artificial intelligence after he realised he couldn&rsquo;t make nearly enough money from his own more natural efforts. He then invented a big pile of bands that don&rsquo;t exist to use as the supposed artist accounts that this music could be uploaded to Spotify under.</p>
<p>He then created a huge number of fake accounts for imaginary people - maybe as many as 10,000 - in order to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to that music, which he did via streaming from a variety of computers that appeared to be in different places.</p>
<p>Because it was so many different songs from so many different artists listened to by so many different people - all fake - he wasn&rsquo;t detected for a while.</p>
<p>It seems it was very much financially worthwhile for him, at least for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/nyregion/nc-man-charged-ai-fake-music.html">From the NYT&rsquo;s report</a> on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a financial breakdown that he emailed himself in 2017 — the year that prosecutors say he began the scheme — Mr. Smith calculated that he could stream his songs 661,440 times each day. At that rate, he estimated, he could bring in daily royalty payments of $3,307.20 and as much as $1.2 million in a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, because of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/union-of-musicians-want-penny-per-stream-from-spotify/">how Spotify pay-outs work</a> - in simple terms they take the revenue they make from user subscriptions and advertising and divide it up between the artists based on what % of streams the artist receives -  presumably this was to the direct financial detriment of other, real, artists (and all the other organisations that also take a cut before it reaches the artist).</p>

			 <p>A friend gets in touch to let me know that it&rsquo;s not necessarily scary AI cyber-brains that are going to end humanity. We also need to be wary of robotically-augmented mushrooms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what sci-fi novel this particular bunch of researchers last read, but something has compelled them to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/robot-mushroom-biohybrid-robotics-cornell-b2606970.html">invent a robot</a> which is controlled by the whims of living fungi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biohybrid robot uses electrical signals from an edible type of mushroom called a king trumpet in order to move around and sense its environment.</p>
<p>Developed by an interdisciplinary team from Cornell University in the US and Florence University in Italy, the machine could herald a new era of living robotics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like I could probably outrun it in its present incarnation though:</p>

<p>The Independent article we learned about this in also revealed the existence of <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lego-robot-controlled-by-artificial-worm-brain-developed-by-openworm-project-1485174">a project called OpenWorm</a> which is looking to upload a digital replica of a worm&rsquo;s brain into some Lego.</p>

			 <p>📄 Reading the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">Pivot to AI</a> blog.</p>
<p>This is high-grade fodder for those of us who harbour a significant amount scepticism for the recent boom in AI, especially of the generative type.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, when this stuff works it can seem like magic, and I do use it in small doses many days. But it really doesn&rsquo;t need to be shoved into every vaguely-digital product, forced down every throat, and used as a threat to the job security of any folk who might well actually be doing their job way better than a robot brain can - even when the AI often exists only because the companies involved took-without-asking the work of the human workers concerned in the first place. Of course improving <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/30/cory-doctorow-reminds.html">quality of output</a> isn&rsquo;t the real reason people are being &ldquo;replaced&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The blog reminds me a bit of Molly White&rsquo;s justly iconic <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web 3 Is Going Just Great</a> blog. But instead of incessant reports on the pointlessness, scamminess and criminality that appears to be infused into the soul of blockchain-world, here we see frequent examples of where we&rsquo;re burning natural resources and consuming vast amounts of money and compute on AI rather than crypto in the name of getting something rather worse than what we had before.</p>
<p>Sample quote from the most recent post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main use case for LLMs is writing text nobody wanted to read. The other use case is summarizing text nobody wanted to read.</p>

			 <p>More events in what is starting to feel something like a global backlash against some of the big social media companies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve previously seen <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/09/01/telegram-is-only.html">the arrest of Telegram&rsquo;s founder</a>, Pavel Durov. Now, elsewhere, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/30/elon-musk-x-could-face-ban-in-brazil-after-failure-to-appoint-legal-representative">Brazil has totally banned the use of Twitter</a> (OK, &ldquo;X&rdquo;) for anyone who lives there. on the basis that they&rsquo;re refusing to appoint a legal representative in Brazil. This is something all foreign companies that operate in Brazil are required to do.</p>
<p>Once again, I know far too little about the situation to judge the rights and wrongs of the ban. Or for that matter its enforceability. Although, at least in theory, X is to be cut off at the ISP level, and hefty fines await any Brazilian users who use VPNs to evade the ban.</p>
<p>It might be noted that this follows Elon Musk, owner of X, becoming upset one of Brazil&rsquo;s judges asked him to suspend the accounts of users he claimed were spreading disinformation. Elon is of course not known for maintaining his cool when someone does anything other than agree wholeheartedly with him. X is <a href="https://x.com/GlobalAffairs/status/1829296715989414281">now claiming</a> that the Brazillian judge was making &ldquo;illegal orders to censor his political opponents.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whatever the ins and outs of the situation, it seems a good amount of Brazil&rsquo;s ex-X users aren&rsquo;t all that disheartened by the news, or at least not to disheartened they can&rsquo;t muster the energy to post through it. They just went somewhere else.</p>
<p>These events have apparently caused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24232561/brazil-x-ban-sending-people-bluesky">a huge wave</a> of signups to X-rival <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> - setting an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/31/bluesky-tops-app-charts-and-sees-all-time-highs-after-brazil-bans-x/">all-time-high record</a> for activity on that platform, plus a substantially lower but above zero number to Mastodon.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://fediversereport.com/last-week-in-fediverse-ep-82/">recent reporting</a> by &ldquo;<a href="https://fediversereport.com/">Last Week in Fediverse</a>&rdquo;, it sounds the Brazillian users have also made Bluesky a lot more of a fun place to be.</p>

			 <p>Some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109724081567">new research</a> is out about that category of drugs which at times seems to be a class of pharmaceuticals that singlehandedly could solve half the world&rsquo;s ills , at least for rich folks who can afford it - GLP-1s.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109724081567">paper by Scirica et al.</a> concerns a randomised controlled trial where researchers provided Semaglutide (aka Wegovy) to patients with overweight or obesity with a view to learning whether it helped prevent cardiovascular (&ldquo;CV&rdquo;) problems, including CV-related death.</p>
<p>The drug didn&rsquo;t seem to do anything to alter the rate at which participants caught Covid-19. But, for those that did catch Covid, it helped prevent them from suffering from serious adverse events - including death - from it when they did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semaglutide did not reduce incident COVID-19; however, among participants who developed COVID-19, fewer participants treated with semaglutide had COVID-19–related serious adverse events (232 vs 277; P = 0.04) or died of COVID-19 (43 vs 65; HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44-0.96).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study reports that it isn&rsquo;t only deaths from Covid that decreased - they saw lower rates in terms of all-cause deaths - a reduction of 19% -  as well as both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular related deaths when broken down in that way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants assigned to semaglutide vs placebo had lower rates of all-cause death (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.93), CV death (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.71-1.01), and non-CV death (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.95).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course no study is perfect, so it&rsquo;s worth reading <a href="https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271027/AIP/1-s2.0-S0735109724081567/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEIz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQCeMSayEXBHGWvGGApobXJSsAX0Ghz8csCNlEcyUgrhYwIhAIWp19sNsZ%2F665Jv%2F8lwVWpbMBD96Tp%2F67MwDftHgGdsKrsFCKX%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQBRoMMDU5MDAzNTQ2ODY1IgzkmOuotnCNfxcVmcwqjwWJBxwPm0JRxo4BXbIhgfatBvMWp5sp%2FaHt5gdVCam7QxNBrdnK8OfuzW7FB9dehVdVflbNTdV8rqKk0IuiIYG40sQu5LXwoXVaAmD51ywzBesxm4VRoP%2F6ZJ17IripLSpstPdozAn73zkKHdYNhNbEdK%2BsE%2BWh97Cki%2F22eGWHPq00b40syVzD2KCzbdLrPSSc9%2FDT1ZB4eEI3Y4hjP524KBhiNZnX5Bg2CHfx0HvBzfCghuR86PxDE72OqfzBu8J9ChsCbDCJRvT8QxiSA8o4cQeAwOKfW6N9ManYyqh2HHNIT%2B8ir8HNhE9rwEm4vZR86%2BcsTVjBv3w3Z1%2BCaKTeDstrpme9f%2FGFwFw33PP3usTxQP9V%2Bp0iwlIDWJRfz%2Bge7qf5kEDRnV1Oc8CtLJXe86Pv45qeYq7JeB3cRbU9QLBgPnuBjQ%2FBnr1VXgbdRLEKO9MVK1niqdVwRNGLPqUXnmbjGU5QeXo26AcK8gDoqOJkvfoolkdF1MiUwtTR6wWjJQlXeGKYUQIYKoR5DOpYKM3S0aAhCHmF7Ho5pPRrfvWCN1j30TwkVe7mapoX30of7kPAiTIUF3iqrhiW%2BtWoEEjLt7ZrQDU7QXuwo03Y1QKPo4jkdMAkB9XdE0nMkJF%2FJP1rIC4g1ISUc9b1TZT5UowbL3EqnNNtO08ACH%2Fus9BWlryyK4tlqQ4vERvpkaKDauXsCL8WB3am%2BJPsqHDlXkxsCqaguzFbbVnSpBFgQiDI2zdBl7nkptU9%2FaDvM0QBB8zkTWKHDVIOGdk5wna1CofFxb2keEG00Erq%2F3lmaNNO2JS7WQwzs2r9K7CilhkwQs%2BIKyeNNvTSEEKFG1Qlv6M26rrs9WfUX%2B%2FS8Y%2BOMJ%2FC1rYGOrABR5r6uiuSxscZNml7cUYL0IQvlAQ4w2Y2Oldx4DGbThAlcywfsta14tz8D5%2BvGBx%2BHsfnwg4GMVzpPU%2FVX%2BGNCSMc7%2BJK%2F%2FhmJp5ceppVCAd2w24fi04e0fJ3aea%2BwOskS6yB360dQ531YW6ZM1VwcP6bFTVDMvGwF63U%2BFIe2tXxTEXP9y7FFom%2BHpzwkXBk55f4CXOam9ljC1Yu3F71oUI8mUOQU8LW2Weg6l%2BzDxo%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240902T121829Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY473ZJO55%2F20240902%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=c7027cdd4fdf3511ef2f7a7a372b0e424b8fa20751bb45a8813d216e9fc784aa&amp;hash=5a4550bb3236ea190b8de2fb45fefbcdc5f921a7cf37cac77bba65fec21df334&amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;pii=S0735109724081567&amp;tid=spdf-d2a04fd1-dbba-402e-b5e8-33f83ec0f723&amp;sid=d633cb173f334248421b5f646bced09bf51cgxrqb&amp;type=client&amp;tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&amp;ua=09065a020400565459&amp;rr=8bcd7163897e60fd&amp;cc=gb">the full thing</a> to understand some of the limitations. But it is nonetheless a result that was described as &ldquo;stunning&rdquo; by Dr Faust, who wrote an <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2024.08.035">editorial</a> in the same issue of the journal.</p>
<p>Having obesity is a <a href="https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/5/1/10">risk factor</a> for suffering greatly or dying from Covid, so this is a group of participants who were more vulnerable to the disease in the first place; albeit it&rsquo;s not a small group; <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity-facts#statistics">over two-thirds of American adults</a> live with overweight or obesity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the jury is out as to whether it was solely the weight loss associated with this drug that provided protection from Covid&rsquo;s worst effects - the participants who used this drug did lose 5kg more weight than the others on average 1 year in -  or whether there is some other mechanism at play. Doctors Maron and Faust, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/health/wegovy-covid-deaths.html">as quoted in the NYT</a>, think there&rsquo;s potentially something else going on as well, potentially around the drugs leading to a reduction in chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>I continue to believe that the irrational efforts some people seem to think we should go to to prevent people who could benefit from these drugs actually getting them is nothing short of deadly in some cases. <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/08/26/treating-obesity-can.html">Treating obesity can save lives</a>.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t looked into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/26/telegram-founder-suspected-allowing-criminal-activity-pavel-durov-prosecutors">the arrest</a> of message-app <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram&rsquo;s</a> founder Pavel Durov enough to form an opinion, but one thing I did learn from<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/27/what-does-the-telegram-founders-arrest-mean-for-the-regulation-of-social-media-companies-pavel-durov?CMP=techtonic_email"> a recent Guardian newsletter on the subject</a> was that Telegram is a lot less private and secure than I&rsquo;d imagined.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagined it as an alternative to fully encrypted messaging services like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> that I just hadn&rsquo;t had any reason to use much so far. But despite its home page promoting it as being privacy oriented - &ldquo;Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct&rdquo;, in reality the service is not end-to-end encrypted for the most part.</p>
<p>Whilst all messages are &ldquo;basic-encrypted&rdquo; such that your internet provider or anyone intercepting communications between your phone and your Wifi router <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-can-telegram-protect-me-against-everything">couldn&rsquo;t read them</a>, only DMs sent via the &ldquo;<a href="https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats">secret chats</a>&rdquo; feature - an opt-in feature that you have to discover and enable yourself - are end-to-end encrypted. Everything outside of that, including all messages in group chats and broadcast channels, is not end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>A lack of end-to-end encryption means that in theory anyone with the correct access - legitimately acquired or not -  to Telegram&rsquo;s systems could in theory read your messages. In addition, Telegram would be able to hand your correspondence over to any authority that requests them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/security-technology/encryption.cfm">ongoing debate</a> as to whether this is a net good or net bad thing of course. But if you came to Telegram for its privacy, well, you have to go to some effort and also stop yourself using most of its features if you want to be absolutely certain that no-one other than your intended recipient can read your message.</p>
<p>All in all, if you want truly private messaging that not even the service&rsquo;s CEO - or a hacker using their account - could see, then from an encryption point of view it turns off you&rsquo;re likely better off using <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318911-How-do-I-know-my-communication-is-private">Signal</a> or even, believe it or not, Meta&rsquo;s <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/820124435853543">WhatsApp</a> (! A cynic might say that this is a sign that it wasn&rsquo;t Meta that invented WhatsApp, they just bought it). Both Signal and WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say even those two services know <em>nothing</em> about you. It just means they don&rsquo;t know the content of your messages, which is often people&rsquo;s first concern - even though metadata can on occasion give away rather more information about you that you might expect.</p>
<p>Signal makes <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/santaclara/">a big deal</a> about how little it stores even on the metadata front. They basically know when your account was created and when it was last used, so that&rsquo;s all they can give to the authorities when legally compelled to do so.

			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/legally-blonde-2001">Legally Blonde</a>.</p>
<p>This was the year rewatched the very famous, very popular, feminist comedy film about a pink-obsessed very feminine blonde young lady who takes herself off on a life-changing journey in a somewhat misguided attempt to preserve things as they are. Eventually she realises she&rsquo;s worth so much more than a trophy wife to an idiot man living a 1950s lifestyle - she&rsquo;s more than just a pretty face - and, hey, we all learn some sanitised but important bits and pieces about the necessity of feminism along the way.</p>
<p>Not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/barbie-movie-republicans-reaction">Barbie</a>, that was <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/08/everyone-was-right.html">earlier this year</a>. Instead, 2001&rsquo;s <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/legally-blonde-2001">Legally Blonde</a>. A classic from my formative years. One of the rare films I deigned to watch more than once per lifetime, and might even spring for tickets to <a href="https://www.legallyblondethemusical.com/">the musical</a> in the future if the opportunity should arise.</p>
<p>Our hero is Elle Woods, a young lady who&rsquo;s into beauty, hair, nails, hanging out with her girlfriends, the colour pink, small dogs and anything else that you could popularly code as &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; back in the year 2001.</p>
<p>Her privileged and wealthy boyfriend dumps her. He still likes her enough. but really she&rsquo;s just a fun time, a bimbo, a silly little girl. Certainly not someone who he can imagine as the serious person that the serious politician he has an ambition should be married to. And you know, male careers come first.</p>
<p>She does not enjoy this decision. Rather than smash up his expensive car though, she decides to follow him to the prestigious only-brainiacs-need-apply <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/">Harvard Law School</a> in order to study law and prove she&rsquo;s a worthwhile and serious person really.</p>
<p>This might be more than a little wince-inducing as the defining motivation for the character - but do remember we&rsquo;re talking about early 2000s Hollywood-sanitised pop-feminist takes here. Barbie wasn&rsquo;t perfect and that was more than twenty years later (it was great though). Besides, it&rsquo;s an important part of the setup. But yep, the film is necessarily something of a product of its times.  Don&rsquo;t expect intersectionality et al. - it&rsquo;s all pretty young White Heterosexual Lady trying to win her man back stuff. At least at first glance. The feminist focus here is instead more explicitly on the late 90s style priorities of smashing various glass ceilings, girl-bossing it, becoming respected male-dominated places of learning and work. Of changing the world by yourself, not having to be content with hanging off the arm of someone else who does.</p>
<p>Which, spoiler alert, of course she does. But perhaps the most empowering point it makes is that she can do so without changing herself, without donning a mask - refusing to conform to what 1990s (and yes, 2024 for plenty) saw as the image of a fancy lawyer who happens to be female.</p>
<p>Here we see that yes, it is possible to be a young lady who enthusiastically likes &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; things and has &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; interests and still make waves in spheres of life beyond being pretty and dating eligible bachelors - not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong or lesser about being interested in those things as well I&rsquo;m sure Elle would be the first to tell you.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2021/05/twenty-years-feminist-classic-legally-blonde">New Statesman</a> review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If its message – that a woman can be smart and enjoy lip gloss simultaneously – does not feel especially radical now, it is worth noting that a generation of millennial women first enjoyed it at the age of ten or 12, when such an idea could be experienced as a revelation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legally_Blonde_(novel)">Thanks to Wikipedia</a> I also learned that the film is based on a novel of the same name by Amanda Brown based on her own experiences of going to Stanford Law School with the same kind of innate preferences for fashion, beauty and the like as our fictional protagonist here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a new prequal <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a60789649/legally-blonde-elle-prequel-series-cast-news/">spinoff TV series</a> called Elle supposedly coming soon, showing her high school lifestyle. But given the second filmic sequel, Legally Blonde 3, was <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a32065693/legally-blonde-3/">supposed to be released in 2020</a> and there&rsquo;s no sign of it yet it&rsquo;s probably best not to hold one&rsquo;s breath.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/27/windows-has-a.html">Windows has a keyboard shortcut for opening LinkedIn for some reason</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/27/windows-has-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-27 11:48:26 &#43;0100">Aug 27, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>New contender for the least useful Windows keyboard shortcut in existence: <code>Windows key + Ctrl + Alt + Shift + L</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shortcut to everyone&rsquo;s favourite thing to do on a computer: visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; you might justifiably ask.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s a mix of two things. Firstly that Microsoft previously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20909475/microsoft-office-key-emoji-key-keyboards">tried to make</a> a special new key on keyboards - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/using-the-office-key-df8665d3-761b-4a16-84b8-2cfb830e6aff">the Office Key</a> - happen. As far as I know it ended up happening substantially less than even &ldquo;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen">fetch</a>&rdquo; did. I&rsquo;ve never seen one IRL anyway.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a sidenote: the smiley face key to the right in the above photo from Microsoft was another new key that as far as I know failed to take off - the emoji key. That one I could see a use for in 2024 business settings, particularly if you&rsquo;re an enthusiastic marketeer. If you don&rsquo;t have that key on whatever you&rsquo;re currently sitting in front of, then <code>Windows key +  .</code> (i.e. the full-stop key) does the same thing, open the Windows emoji picker.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the Office Key. Any keyboard shortcuts that would have used the Office key can now be used by the rest of us via <code>Windows + Ctrl + Alt + Shift + whatever</code>. And LinkedIn was one, it being famously the case that the average office worker trawls that site once per hour desperately looking for a new job to escape from their current deskbound prison to.</p>
<p>And secondly that Microsoft <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-buys-linkedin/">bought LinkedIn back in 2016</a> for $26 billion with the aim to &ldquo;integrate it with Microsoft’s enterprise software, such as Office 365&rdquo;. Well, they did successfully integrate it with a key that almost no-one has access to I guess.</p>
<p>The first point means that actually there&rsquo;s arguably even less useful keyboard shortcuts available if I&rsquo;m honest. <code>Office Key/ Windows + Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Y</code> for instance opens &ldquo;<a href="https://www.yammer.com/">yammer.com</a>&rdquo; which seems to be a kind of Facebook for companies I&rsquo;ve never heard of called &ldquo;Viva Engage&rdquo;. I must admit to visiting LinkedIn more often than Yammer (total for the latter before today: zero times), although I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s been any more productive.</p>
<p>I could see <code>Windows + Ctrl + Alt + Shift + X</code> for &ldquo;Load Excel&rdquo; being a bit more useful for me, although by the time I manage to get my hand into the correct shape to reliably hit that combo I probably could have opened it 5 other ways.</p>

			 <p>The US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/22/new-coronavirus-vaccine-covid/">approved new vaccines</a> for Covid-19 last week. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html">recommendation from the CDC</a> is that basically everyone goes avail themselves of them, aside from anyone with any specific health conditions that preclude it one assumes.</p>
<p>These vaccines are a lot more effective than the previous set against the latest strains of Covid that are circulating around. These newer variants are causing something of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/03/covid-rising-kp2-flirt-lb1/">a new wave of Covid cases</a>, albeit one substantially less harmful to most people to what we saw in the early days of the pandemic. But it&rsquo;s not less harmful to <em>everyone</em>; people are still dying of it, and that&rsquo;s before we get onto the horror-show of life-altering risks that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">Long Covid</a> can entail.</p>
<p>Personally I could wish I&rsquo;d have had one of vaccines a few weeks ago, having gotten quite ill recently - but without travelling through time and space it wasn&rsquo;t really an option.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781447268963">Station Eleven</a> by Emily St John Mandel.</p>
<p>Imagine Covid but much worse.</p>
<p>This book was released in 2014, several years before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">the Covid-19 pandemic</a> but is surely a more emotional experience to read after (well, <a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-covid-19-still-a-pandemic/">during it</a>). In <a href="https://time.com/5804007/emily-st-john-mandel-station-eleven-coronavirus/">one or two interviews</a> I saw, the author, very understandably, even seems to feel a little bad that the IRL plague might have proved positive for her in a marketing sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, back in this imaginary world we see a pandemic flu come to the fore - the &lsquo;Georgia Flu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s far, far more virulent in terms of spreading and killing than our most recent real life pandemic was. The vast majority of humans are dead within weeks.</p>
<p>Civilisation as we know it collapses in short order.</p>
<p>Travelling via air was one of the first casualties. But within a few years the few folk that survived now live mostly in small, guarded, settlements in a world without basic services such as plumbing or electricity. People are dying of things we&rsquo;d find inconsequential for the lack of medical resources or technologies.</p>
<p>The book goes forwards and backwards through time, pre and post pandemic , with the most recent sections being set around year 20 of the pandemic if I remember correctly.  By that point we have young folk who never knew the pre-pandemic world in place. For this new generation the idea of flying machines and lit up TV screens is pure science fiction.</p>
<p>Governments are long gone. Borders are unguarded. The very concept of countries is alien to those who don&rsquo;t remember the before-times. In any case there&rsquo;s no realistic way to travel long distances unless you like very long journeys by horse.</p>
<p>The book follows the lives of various characters before and after the big event. Much of it is centred around the story of a group of musicians and actors known as the &lsquo;Travelling Symphony&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is a band of not always merry men and women who travel via horse and cart from settlement to settlement - a far from risk-free endeavour -  in order to perform music and theatre to the residents. Why? For them, &lsquo;survival is insufficient&rsquo;; a quote explicitly borrowed from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708974/quotes/">Star Trek: Voyager</a>.</p>
<p>This is a very engaging, wonderfully written book whose sentimental impact and poignancy has surely only increased now most of us have lived through an admittedly far milder, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_death_rates_by_country">still plenty deadly</a>, pandemic of our own.</p>
<p>Whilst dark and upsetting in places - it wasn&rsquo;t only the good guys who survived, and the collapse of civilisation wouldn&rsquo;t be pretty either way - the overall message could be taken as one of hope, of the indefatigability of humans and their humanity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/station-eleven">a recent TV show</a> based on the book too which I&rsquo;m enthusiastic to see at some point.</p>

			 <p>Just in case any wayward Americans wanted even more reasons to vote Democrat in the upcoming presidential elections - although &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not Trump&rdquo; should really be sufficient to be fair -  it seems like the Dem campaign <a href="https://www.avclub.com/harris-walz-campaign-uses-dril-tweet-in-email">co-opted a tweet</a> from none other than world&rsquo;s best poster <a href="https://x.com/dril">dril</a> in service of their campaign.</p>
<p>They went with a screenshot of one of the more famous missives; the now-a-decade-old &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/549425182767861760">I&rsquo;m not mad</a>&rdquo; one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and another thing: im not mad. please dont put in the newspaper that i got mad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was of course in reference to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-unhinged-press-conference">increasingly unhinged performances</a> by their mortal enemy, Trump, at his ramshackle press conferences. Writing that sentence just brought back happy memories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Seasons_Total_Landscaping_press_conference">Four Seasons Total Landscaping</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware this is the first time that this God of the Posting Age has been immortalised in official campaign material. I hope this means he&rsquo;s granted a special place in the Library of Congress or something.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Dems repeated the mistake of all those embarrassing Republican campaigns who use some famous music only to be told by the artist concerned that they loathe everything the campaign stand for. Dril was not quite as vocally aggressive perhaps, but honestly, Kamala should give him at least <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dril-kamala-harris-trump-post-1235084267/">the $25 he requested</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think they should be forced to apologize publicly,” writes @dril, “in an unnecessary and embarrassing display of fealty towards me and my posts, as well as compensate me for the full value of the tweet, which I estimate would be about $25.00.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;d even consider withdrawing <a href="https://x.com/dril/status/1821649007208493361">his rather feisty post</a> on the subject of the current government&rsquo;s approach to the Israel/Palestine troubles (but probably not, dril doesn&rsquo;t seem the kind of guy to be so easily bought in this way).</p>
<p>Given he&rsquo;s back in the news, it seems as good a time as ever to commermorate some of dril&rsquo;s finest work. If &ldquo;x.com&rdquo; ever does totally vanish that will be perhaps the only part I&rsquo;d miss. Here is some of that gold dust for posterity.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/22/the-ifss-interactive.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-22 10:53:26 &#43;0100">Aug 22, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> has released a <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/calculators/what-has-been-distributional-impact-tax-and-benefit-reforms-2010">handy interactive tool</a> that lets you analyse how all the tax and benefit changes since 2010 - the year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election">the Conservatives were elected into government</a> under David Cameron - have impacted the disposable incomes households have at their disposal.</p>
<p>You can segment the chart in various ways including by household income, family type, having children and so on.</p>
<p>It may be a fairly harrowing experience for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t been following the impacts to date. Its default setup, showing impact of changes to benefits and direct taxes since 2010 shows that the people with the lowest incomes suffered the most. By far.</p>
<p>The general pattern is people with higher incomes were more rewarded by the changes. The rich get richer, the poor suffer more and more.</p>
<p>The exception is the top decile by income who did lose disposable income - equivalent to £2180 per year since 2010. That might sound a lot, but it&rsquo;s less even in absolute terms that the £2205 that the poorest decile lost out each year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And because people with the highest incomes have&hellip;well&hellip;higher incomes to start off with - higher by an order of magnitude on average - in percentage terms the losses by the poorest folk are far, far more dramatic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Truly sickening. Headlines such as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68625344.amp">Absolute poverty: UK sees biggest rise for 30 years</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://cpag.org.uk/news/official-child-poverty-statistics-350000-more-children-poverty-and-numbers-will-rise">Official child poverty statistics: 350,000 more children in poverty and numbers will rise</a>&rdquo; cannot come as a surprise.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most dramatic, most terrifying, result I found within the chart so far has a relationship to the latter headline above. Whatever cruel untruths the more extreme members of the Conservatives party might like to pretend about adults in poverty, it&rsquo;s hard for anyone to blame the children. But set the chart to look at working age households who have children and you&rsquo;ll see that those who had the lowest 10% of incomes in that group apparently lost an astonishing £6,009 per year on average.</p>
<p>It beggars belief to even imagine how they could even begin to cope. I suppose the headlines show that many of them cannot.</p>

			 <p>I came across another random fix to an annoying computer problem. When using a Windows 11 laptop it started insisting there were no devices capable of playing sound, even though the computer had its standard speaker, I&rsquo;d plugged headphones in and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes the built-in audio trouble-shooter would fix it, but only temporarily.</p>
<p>After some fiddling around I determined it seemed to happen when my webcam was plugged in. It turns out that this isn&rsquo;t a problem unique to me, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/15403ku/whenever_i_plug_in_my_webcam_it_disables_all/">Reddit</a> helped provide an answer.</p>
<p>The solution for me was to open Device Manager. One way to get there is to open the Start menu and, type Device Manager.</p>
<p>Then look for the category of devices in it called &ldquo;Sound, video and game controllers&rdquo;. Assuming you find that your webcam is listed there (in my case it was a Logitech C920), right click it and choose to disable it.</p>
<p>After a reboot I had my sound back! And the webcam still appears to work. At least as a video camera which is what I use it for. I suppose any audio functionality it has built into it may not work, but I didn&rsquo;t test that. Personally I don&rsquo;t need my webcam playing or recording its own audio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve no idea if this is a bug with Windows 11, the specific drivers some part of my audio setup or the webcam itself, or what. But whatever the cause, the above fixed it. You can always repeat the above and choose to re-enable the thing you disabled if it doesn&rsquo;t work out for you.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781394201655">Starting &amp; Running a Business All-in-One For Dummies</a> by Colin Barrow. At least the sections of it that seemed relevant to what I wanted to know.</p>
<p>After years of exclusively working for larger organisations, I recently had reason to learn something about how to set up a new business. Having little experience in the area, and with no obvious lead contender in books to learn this stuff from, I felt like a book &ldquo;for dummies&rdquo; might be appropriate for me.</p>
<p>It claims to be six books in one. That&rsquo;s perhaps a stretch - but does give a clue as to how the volume is laid out. These are the titles of the six &ldquo;books&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Laying the groundwork</li>
<li>Sorting out your finances</li>
<li>Finding and managing staff</li>
<li>Keeping on top of your books</li>
<li>Marketing and advertising your wares</li>
<li>Growing and improving your business</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a little repetition between some of the sections, but not a ton.</p>
<p>Having not a lot to compare it to I don&rsquo;t feel qualified to give a strong verdict on it. My sense it that whilst it doesn&rsquo;t go in-depth enough in many topics to be all you would need to know in order to optimally succeed, it did provide at least a couple of helpful features:</p>
<ol>
<li>It helps those of us who are inexperienced at least know which topics we should be thinking about. For instance, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d have realised that I should look into the insurance implications of working from home, or that there are so many different organisations out there that may be open to supporting or nurturing small businesses. It also helped me to know what the basic suite of financial reports that folk evaluating a business would be interested in are - even if there&rsquo;s likely not enough detail enclosed to, for instance, confidently complete a tax return. But it at least reminds you that you will need to complete one!</li>
<li>It also has plenty of links to further information - mostly websites, and a few phone numbers. Lists of potentially useful organisations, links to free tools and templates, to government resources, to further information from industry bodies and so on. So it&rsquo;s a also nice collection of &ldquo;here are some websites you might want to visit before going too far down any unchangeable path&rdquo;.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/13/the-uk-far.html">The UK far right riots show the days of overt and violent racist behaviour in the UK are far from over</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/13/the-uk-far.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-13 10:02:14 &#43;0100">Aug 13, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The past few days have made it very clear that anyone who thought the days of the British far right as an effectual and meaningful force was a relic of the past were wrong.</p>
<p>The days of overt racism leading to rabid racist-inspired violence at a level that &ldquo;matters&rdquo;  (as if any level wouldn&rsquo;t) have gone nowhere, even whilst people that should know better occasionally try and pretend everything is at least OKish.</p>
<p>Catching up with the news somewhat late, there was a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/clashes-uks-southport-after-killing-three-girls-leaves-many-police-injured-2024-07-31/">horrific and deadly, attack</a> on a group of children and the people who were supervising their dance class. Three children died and a further group of 10 adults and children were stabbed. It was an appalling act. There are no excuses. The perpetrator is in custody and that can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Some bright spark on &ldquo;X&rdquo; decided to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/online-disinformation-sparked-a-wave-of-far-right-violence-in-the-uk.html">invent the fact</a> that the attack was carried out by a Muslim asylum seeker who had just gotten off - of course - a small boat - naming him and everything. In reality the attacker was born in Wales, but hey, social media gonna social media.</p>
<p>Of course even if that story had been true what came next would have been outrageous. But for it all to be based on a lie just makes it even more sickening somehow.</p>
<p>The event kicked off far-right inspired protests, riots, and abject violence all around the country. Screaming hatred at anyone who didn&rsquo;t look like Nick Griffin&rsquo;s idiotic vision of what a &ldquo;true&rdquo; Ingerlandder looks like was just the start. Presenting a truly hostile environment <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/17/theresa-mays-latest.html">beyond even the original vision of the Conservatives</a> was on full display. <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-riots-far-right-protests-latest-southport-police-anti-racism-counter-live-13186819">Petrol bombs</a> were thrown at mosques. Police vans and stations were set alight. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/rioting-thugs-throw-rocks-filipino-33392232">Rocks were hurled at Filipino nurses</a> who were on their way to work in a hospital as emergency cover during these riots. Mobs even descended on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/04/rioters-try-to-torch-rotherham-asylum-seeker-hotel-amid-far-right-violence">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13708115/riots-migrant-hotel-holiday-inn-tamowoth.html">hotels</a> where they believed asylum seekers were being held in order to burn them alive, all whilst shouting &ldquo;England, England, England&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In short, all the things that one might expect to happen in a resentful, racist country which has for years (forever?) been constantly fed inflammatory lies from our mainstream politicians and media, mixed in with the malign influence of present-day <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/11/its-ok-everyone-else-is-doing-it-how-do-we-deal-with-role-violence-on-social-media-played-in-uk-riots">social media</a>, about how some of the most desperate people in the world are &ldquo;invading&rdquo; our country solely in order to ruin your life specifically. We&rsquo;ve been somehow convinced that it&rsquo;s the people with no power, rather than the people that exercise true power over us, that make our lives a struggle. As soon as some perceived - no matter how illogical - &ldquo;excuse&rdquo; for individuals of certain views to let out their simmering, violent, racist intentions pops up, this is what we see; egged on by foreign disinformation spread by such luminaries as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/8/why-is-elon-musk-clashing-with-the-uk-government-over-far-right-riots">Elon Musk</a> amongst many others.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/11/star-trek-strange.html">Star Trek: Strange New Worlds - a newer Star Trek series seemingly modelled on TNG</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/11/star-trek-strange.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-11 12:23:59 &#43;0100">Aug 11, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-strange-new-worlds">Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</a>.</p>
<p>I was a huge fan of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> as a child, and also enjoyed the re-runs of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek">the original series</a>. And with Strange New Worlds they&rsquo;ve finally produced something kind of similar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a refreshing change from some of the other recent reincarnations of Star Trek which are often very enjoyable, but more in the vein of trying to be a gritty 12 hour long film with appropriate thriller-style cliff-hangers you need to remember from one episode to the next, if not binging.</p>
<p>So with this one, we&rsquo;re back to (almost) each episode being its own little story, with a set up, the requisite drama and a resolution all within the hour. What the crew actually gets up to seems also quite similar to the older TNG stuff - exploring, encountering new aliens, facing dilemmas, accidentally travelling through time and dimensions, that kind of thing. There are some storylines that permeate through each series, which was also the case in the old show - but the main drama of the day is a one-and-done thing contained within a single episode for the most part.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s occasionally some real cheesy stuff, kind of like some of the newer Doctor Who episodes have. Those episodes I typically don&rsquo;t love as much, but they make for some variation, and presumably some people do enjoy them. Yes, they even found a way to wedge in a musical episode.</p>
<p>Old-school Trek fans will also recognise at least some of the characters. They are substantially more baby-faced to their previous incarnations due to the series being set in the time period preceding Captain Kirk&rsquo;s captainship of the Enterprise. Instead it&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Pike_(Star_Trek)">Captain Pike</a>, Kirk&rsquo;s immediate predecessor, in charge of the original version of the Federation&rsquo;s flagship, the Starship Enterprise.</p>
<p>Serving alongside him we see a couple of old faves - a communications trainee who happens to have the surname Uhura, and Spock, already a science officer, already struggling with his half-Vulcan half-human identity. Turns out future-Captain Kirk (who we do meet, but not as a captain) has a brother, a xenobiologist type, who works for Pike. I understand that people with better memories than me will also recognise some of the other crew, or at least that they were referred to back in the day.</p>
<p>So all in all, similar characters, similar adventures, similar episode structures to the decades-old incarnation of the Trekkie universe. Hard to objectively say how much I enjoyed it for the nostalgia vs how much I&rsquo;d love it if I was new to the whole thing. But for anyone similarly aged to me who wants something akin to the TNG adventures, definitely go for it.</p>

			 <p>Some conspiracies are real. For all the right-wing concern about some loony left shadowy elites trying to control the world and generally being up to no good, I think it&rsquo;s a few of the mega rich and powerful folk who are clearly on the right - even if they occasionally decide they&rsquo;re godlike being who operate at levels above such pathetic human ideologies - we might worry about in the immediate term.</p>
<p>A few months ago the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In April, Musk co-hosted a secret dinner of around a dozen business leaders in Los Angeles. The guests included Peltz; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, chairman emeritus of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This took place at David Sacks' massive house. Sacks and Musk worked together back in the early days of Paypal. Sacks is now, of course, yet another Silicon Valley venture capitalist.</p>
<p><a href="https://puck.news/elon-musk-david-sacks-host-anti-biden-dinner-party/">Puck adds further names</a> to the guest list- although I&rsquo;m not certain if this refers to the same event or another similar anti-Biden &ldquo;secret billionaire dinner party&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Milken himself was there, in fact, as were billionaires Rupert Murdoch and Peter Thiel. A few government types, including Steven Mnuchin, scored invites. There were also some less politically active titans of industry, such as Uber co-founder and former C.E.O. Travis Kalanick</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are all these distasteful people taking the time to go party at each other&rsquo;s houses? Basically in the service of political corruption via wealth.</p>
<p>Back to the WSJ&rsquo;s reporting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discussion at times centered on how attendees could give money to Trump outside of public view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, how best to funnel huge amounts of money into defeating the Democrats as a whole, given even America has <em>some</em> limits on this kind of thing. Plus, believe it or not, there was a time that giving millionaires to a uniquely unsuitable and unstable presidential candidate out of at best sheer personal greed, was something a few of even this posse might feel some shame about.</p>
<p>Anyway, the gatherings spread. Real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette_Smoking_Man">X-Files smoking man</a> stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peltz and Musk also told Trump of an influence campaign in elite circles that is already under way, in which Musk and his political allies host gatherings of powerful business leaders across the country to try to convince them not to support President Biden’s re-election campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst Puck&rsquo;s reporting suggested that the gathering they wrote about was supposedly more anti-Democrat than pro-Trump as a person, we do now know that some of those folk are very invested in supporting Trump as a person; in fact as the most qualified person in the whole of the US to exercise increasingly absolute power over its citizenry.</p>
<p>In more recent times, particularly since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump">assassination attempt</a> on their preferred leader, Donald Trump, the whole shadowy billionaires having secret meetings about corrupting the political process in favour of Trump with their vast wealth has become less of an amateur secret conspiracy and more a very public stating of preferences and pumping of vast sums of money in order to try and buy the election result that they want, alongside currying favour with the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/donald-trumps-consistent-unreliability-on-covid-and-everything-else">famously unreliable</a> but perfectly able-to-be-bribed potential future president that they believe can make all their unhinged dreams come true.</p>
<p>David Sacks went from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-murdoch-biden-dinner-b2538718.html">saying in 2021</a> that Trump had &ldquo;disqualified himself from being a candidate at the national level again&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/20/business/dealbook/silicon-valley-trump.html">a public endorsement in 2024</a>. Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen are amongst other public supporters and money shovellers.</p>
<p>Musk is one of the larger donors, having recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823">pledged to donate $45 million <em>a month</em></a> to a pro-Trump <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee#Super_PACs">Super PAC</a> (for the non-Americans amongst us, the relevance of a Super PAC here as far as I understand it is that it&rsquo;s a workaround so very rich people can give way more money to political campaigns than they would technically be allowed to directly). The same PAC is receiving hefty donations from Palantir Technologies co-founder Joe Lonsdale and the Winklevoss twins, who it turns out are now heavily into cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So what does one get for $45 million? Well, outside of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/donald-trump-elon-musk-alliance-d1fe43e3">a formal role in Trump&rsquo;s government</a>, it seems that you probably get to choose who the US Vice President is going to be. Unless it was a perfect coincidence that the day after Musk committed that money <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-vice-president-vance-rubio-burgum-rnc-6cc438a8370a21b2631f5a53b06b71d0">Trump announced</a> that his pick was the multi-millionaire JD Vance, who happens to be someone these weird tech billionaires really like.</p>
<p>Despite being famous in the past for having written a book about the travails of being a poor White man in his memoir, which somehow I still haven&rsquo;t read - <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062872258?title=Hillbilly+Elegy&amp;author=J.+D.+Vance&amp;cover_id=172665">Hillbilly Elegy</a> - Vance actually spent many of his earlier years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/15/trumps-vp-candidate-j-d-vance-has-long-ties-to-silicon-valley-and-was-a-vc-himself/?ref=404media.co">working as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist</a> under the afore-mentioned arch-libertarian Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>In fact the illogically wealthy tech bros like JD Vance so much that mere hours after Trump named him as his VP pick we saw some more of those kind of VCs,  Marc Andreessen - someone who has convinced himself that regulating artificial intelligence is <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually-actually-guy">Ackchyually</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.404media.co/marc-andreesen-manifesto-says-ai-regulation-is-a-form-of-murder">a form of murder</a>&rdquo;, - and his company&rsquo;s cofounder Ben Horowitz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNclEgQZQ">publicly express</a> their support for this dangerous fool.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, substantial motivation for this comes from Trumps likelihood of not getting in the way of whatever the latest cryptocurrency scam they want to run is.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://americanprospect.bluelena.io/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=fa2e8c4385712f9a1d24c363a2cbe5b8.2813&amp;s=e2a6bd41e301af690d8980c64caa4683">The American Prospect writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;to Musk and Thiel and a growing number of the Valley’s biggest players, any infringement on capitalists’ sovereignty is anathema</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JD Vance very much sups from the same cup.</p>
<p>And it certainly seems to be buying them the outcome they want. See for example the extremely bizarre section of the <a href="https://prod-static.gop.com/media/RNC2024-Platform.pdf">Republican&rsquo;s 2024 platform</a> whereby they decry any attempts to limit the grift-filled world of cryptocurrency or any attempt to stop AI Hitlers coming to the fore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto
crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency.</p>
<p>We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the
right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from
Government Surveillance and Control.
&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will repeal Joe Biden’s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI
Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this
technology.</p>
<p>Sure. it&rsquo;s written in the style of a particularly unhinged kidnapper sending a ransom note, and maybe the founding fathers didn&rsquo;t <em>technically</em> list the right to <a href="https://kottke.org/21/03/cryptocurrency-explained">solving sudokus whilst the world burns</a> as a fundamental human right as such, but I&rsquo;m sure they would have if they weren&rsquo;t busy with other stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/email/ae79d8cc-a24b-44dc-81d6-f156b12cdbf4">404 Media notes</a> that of course there&rsquo;s not really any shortage of uncontrolled AI bunkum flying around the world under Biden&rsquo;s administration. Rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Vance and Trump are not uniquely qualified to support the development of AI. They are simply the Republican nominees, and people at the head of AI companies and venture capital firms are excited about them because historically Republican administrations make them pay less taxes and do whatever they want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The VP nomination happened even though Vance <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html">didn&rsquo;t really get on well</a> with Trump in the past which would normally disqualify him from taking a seat anywhere near the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/trumps-grudges-are-his-agenda/532395/">famously grudge-bearing</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/02/jimmy-kimmel-roasts-fragile-snowflake-donald-trump-for-allegedly-trying-to-censor-him">snowflake</a> who <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/trump-scams-the-people-who-trust">turns on even the people who truly trust him</a> whenever it suits him.</p>
<p>Choice phrases Vance used to describe Trump in the past include &ldquo;a moral disaster&rdquo;, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Hitler&rdquo;, &ldquo;a total fraud&rdquo; and &ldquo;reprehensible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But by 2020 this never-Trumper was publicly voting for Trump, whilst arguing that he too at least semi-believes some version of the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/19/politics/donald-trump-big-lie-explainer/index.html">Big Lie</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954">wouldn&rsquo;t have certified the 2020 electoral result</a> but rather kept himself busy by firing every single civil servant instead. Very normal. Definitely not <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/30/republicans-weird/">weird</a> (or illegal). And in 2024 he&rsquo;s standing as his best-buddy VP.</p>
<p>The thirst for power at the expense of everything and everyone else is truly a disgusting thing to watch.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593535370">Titanium Noir</a> by Nick Harkaway.</p>
<p>Sci-fi detective noir, what&rsquo;s not to love in this genre? It&rsquo;s set in a world where a very few, very rich, contingent of people have managed to get themselves treated with a new genetic therapy called T7. You know, exactly the kind of thing our current tech billionaires <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-wealthiest-entrepreneurs-ceo-billionaires-tech-searching-hacking-longevity">would hoard and indulge in</a> if they knew how to.</p>
<p>Taking that drug, whilst in the short term being a painful experience, essentially resets your physical system to something like your teenage years. You de-age, become healthier, bigger, stronger and so on. You might be 70 years old in chronological terms, but appear and feel like a giant, even God-like, 40 year old.  The owner of the company that makes this stuff, Ste­fan Tonfamecasca, has had a few doses and grown to almost 4 metres tall with an equivalently boosted all-round stature.</p>
<p>In short, the patients who use this therapy become Titans.</p>
<p>Cal Sounder, on the other hand - a standard human - is an independent detective who specialises in consulting on sensitive cases that the police don&rsquo;t really want to touch. These include cases involving Titans, a subject area that the conventional police are loathe to dig into too deeply not least due to the power structures involved.</p>
<p>Imagine Sounder&rsquo;s surprise then when he shows up to a supposedly mundane murder scene, as far as that sort of thing could exist, where the victim appeared at first to be a fairly poor, beleaguered, very shy professor. Of course it turns out that the professor was in fact a Titan. But how on earth did such an atypical guy become a Titan? And who could possibly have killed such a giant? Titans, with all their privileges and protections, do not typically end up as murder victims.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for Cal, and the reader, to figure out.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781668025703">The Future</a> by Naomi Alderman.</p>
<p>This is by the same author as the rightfully extremely famous book &ldquo;The Power&rdquo;, which is now also a TV series. Most reviews I&rsquo;ve seen seem to regard &ldquo;The Future&rdquo; as a distinct step down from its best-selling award-winning predecessor - not that it is a sequel as such; it stands alone. But I liked it at least as much, and possibly more, than her earlier one. Admittedly a lot of that might be because it plays directly into some of my stronger current prejudices.</p>
<p>It takes place in a world that&rsquo;s basically a slightly ahead-in-time version of our own. There are three big tech firms that have managed to infuse themselves in almost every sphere of public and private life; let&rsquo;s call them Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Well, to be fair, the book is slightly more subtle; Fantail, Anvil and Medlar. It so happens that Fantail basically does everything that Facebook does in our world, Anvil does everything Amazon does, and Medlar does everything Apple does.</p>
<p>Fun fact, a medlar is, in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mespilus_germanica">a small unpleasant looking fruit</a> which has, in its time, had such nicknames as &ldquo;open-arse&rdquo;. When cooked in a certain way it tastes like apple sauce. Clearly someone did their research.</p>
<p>Each is run by some kind of weird selfish billionaire who wields absolute power over their domain and  that of their users who has an insatiable thirst for more profit. Nothing is ever enough. Just in case things go pear shaped (which, being largely in control of, they know it will happen at some point), they all have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-inside-hawaii-compound/">top secret bunkers</a> to go hide out in in the event of some otherwise world-shattering event. I wonder where Alderman gets her ideas from, huh?</p>
<p>The story starts at a point where their fancy-schmancy exclusive AI watch - think ChatGPT but you can trust it and it costs a lot more than $20 a month - tells them that actually today is the day. It&rsquo;s time to go pick up their wives and kids (if they can be bothered to) and hightail out of there like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. Because there may well not be for most of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>The story is vey good, but I particularly revelled in some of the descriptions of the harms these Definitely Fictional characters caused in their profit-seeking ventures.</p>
<p>A couple of examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your data belongs to you, then you ought to decide exactly who uses it and how. You should be able to transfer it from place to place as you want, and access it as you like through any service. The reason they don&rsquo;t let you do these things is not because it&rsquo;s hard; it&rsquo;s because it doesn&rsquo;t make them more money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not only true in the real world but it illustrates how contingent some of these decisions are, how deliberate and unnecessary. What seems inevitable in the world of technology rarely, perhaps never, is inevitable. It&rsquo;s choices made by extraordinarily privileged people.</p>
<p>Another such choice <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/">that plagues our real world</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The type of emotional optimisation Anvil and Medlar and Fantail did as a matter of course every day. Each of their websites, thinscreen interfaces, smart torcs, burst displays and mobile phone applications had specific commands about what to show and what to bury. Certain emotions drove high engagement - people looked for longer at things that made them angry or afraid&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>These sites presented themselves as a clear pane of glass through which you could see the world as it was. But they were really a distorting visor, showing you the version of the world that worked best for the board and stockholders of the companies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Algorithms are not inherently bad and wrong. It&rsquo;s the choice of what to optimise them for that makes them so.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t preordained by mystical forces that the primary goal of all mainstream social media networks, amongst other publishing entities, needed to be to capture the attention of users for longer than the users actually wanted to give it to them and make them click on things they didn&rsquo;t really want to click on. It was preordained by the economic structure &ldquo;we&rdquo; chose to live under and the choice - choice! - of business structure that these organisations all ended up going with.</p>
<p>In another world - not Alderman&rsquo;s one either - the goal could I have been, I don&rsquo;t know, create world peace perhaps. Or at least try and make your users go away happy rather than angry and upset.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t stop myself now. Here&rsquo;s another snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We despise the animals because they don&rsquo;t think just like us, we use them and we hurt them. We invent gods, we invent aliens, now we make a friend out of fucking matchboxes. We want to say it &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; but is not true. We want to give it everything, let it make choices, believe it can care for us. It is image of a man made of paper and beads and we so fucking lonely we call it a friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Umm, have you <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/07/31/an-ai-company.html">visited friend.com</a> recently?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stop before I give too much away, but if you hold any kind of scepticism about big tech, social media, AI, that kind of stuff then there&rsquo;s probably something you&rsquo;ll like here in a philosophical sense. If that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve never thought about all that much, which I assume is the case for most normal sane folk, then you might inadvertently learn something about some of the problems people see with these systems by enjoying this novel. And if you don&rsquo;t care about the topic at all, or virulently disagree with the passages I have to be fair very much handpicked to make a point above, then, well, hopefully you&rsquo;ll still enjoy the story.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/01/once-again-managing.html">Once again, managing a government budget is not like managing a household budget</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/08/01/once-again-managing.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-08-01 11:43:19 &#43;0100">Aug 1, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I always appreciate seeing a reminder as to why, despite what politicians from several parties insist on telling us, managing government spending is nothing at all like managing a household budget. And thus, the logic you use when doing so should be entirely different.</p>
<p>What you need to do to act as a &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; householder under the present framework is different to what you need to do to act as a responsible government minister. Pretending that they&rsquo;re the same thing is irresponsible (and in fact often represents a misunderstanding of how sensible people do manage household budgets).</p>
<p>Aditya Chakrabortty provides a nice quick summary of many of the relevant factors in an article from today&rsquo;s Guardian called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/01/george-osborne-osbornomics-labour-party-public-sector-cuts-rachel-reeves">The cynical spectre of Osbornomics is haunting the Labour party</a>':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;unlike individuals, nation states don&rsquo;t retire or die; that no household hides a government&rsquo;s printing press or tax department in its loft conversion; that most families do borrow to invest (for what else is a mortgage?) and will spend cash to keep kids from going hungry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the only reasons. A couple more that come to mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The choices a household makes tend to impact only themselves to any large extent.  The choices a government makes can impact the whole nation, its whole economy.</li>
<li>If a household doesn&rsquo;t buy a luxury holiday this year then it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily affect other aspects of their budget. It just saves the holiday money. Whereas cuts to public service costs in one area for example often lead to rises in expenses for other area. A classic example of this would be a reduction in GP services tends to lead to an increased demand for (more expensive) hospital services. Sacking 1000 civil servants? That&rsquo;s 1000 more people who may require benefit payments, training, education et al for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean a government in a country with its own currency operates with no constraints of course. Liz Truss&rsquo; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/revealed-the-30bn-cost-of-liz-trusss-disastrous-mini-budget">rapid destruction</a> of our economy proved that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just different, usually lesser, constraints.  And at the end of the day, if it needs money to solve any given emergency, it has that money if it chooses to have that money.</p>

Which makes for a  hilarious FAQ with &ldquo;frequently&rdquo; asked questions including &ldquo;When will I receive my friend?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How much does friend cost?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One percent of me looks at this stuff and thinks maybe, just maybe, there&rsquo;s a temporary use for this stuff in acute situations, if run for reasons other than idle profit. It&rsquo;s possible I am just an old man raging at the wind, misguided in an adherence to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature">appeal-to-nature fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>After all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern">loneliness epidemic</a> seems to be real, and occasionally deadly. Experiences like those we saw when <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/07/the-day-replika.html">Replika lobotomised everyone&rsquo;s girlfriends</a> show that some users do form deep bonds with AI entities. It just doesn&rsquo;t feel like this is the general, long-term, solution we need. Apart from anything else, this instantiation of the idea seems cumbersome, and if you break it, the company decides to stop supporting it or starts charging an extortionate subscription for it then your friend just died.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t always have a loneliness epidemic, and it wasn&rsquo;t because Victorians wandered around town dressed in their top hats and gimmicky plastic necklaces. At the very least, please, please, do and show the actual, rigorous, universally acclaimed research to show that these things do good and do not do harm in the short and long term before foisting them upon an increasingly desperate population. It surely wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to get funding for that.</p>

			 <p>Nine of the last twelve standard supermarket eggs I&rsquo;ve cracked open had double yolks. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever seen even a single egg like this before.</p>
<p>What could this <em>mean</em>? Is it another sign of an impending Armageddon?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Well, tradition-wise, there&rsquo;s a variety of options depending on your affiliations. At least according to <a href="https://www.saudereggs.com/blog/why-do-some-eggs-have-two-yolks/">Sauder&rsquo;s Eggs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norseman thought that double-yolk eggs meant someone in your family is going to die. Oh dear.</li>
<li>Wiccans believed that it&rsquo;s a sign of future good fortune for the egg-cracker. I think I&rsquo;d prefer to go with this one.</li>
<li>In some cultures, it&rsquo;s supposedly a sign that a someone you know (or you yourself) is going to become pregnant.</li>
</ul>
<p>How often do double-yolks occur? Well according to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/greatmomentsinscience/features/what-are-the-odds-of-getting-a-double-yolk-egg/7625330">Dr Karl Kruszelnicki</a>, if you average out the rates from chickens of all ages than 1 in 1000 eggs would have two yolks. So have a experienced a one in many many trillion life event - far rarer than a lottery win?</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily. The way modern egg-farming works means that at a box level double-yolks are not an a <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-31439-6_744">statistically independent</a> phenomenon. Eggs of a certain size, from hens of a certain breed or age, or those having experienced certain patterns of light exposure <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/breakfast-brunch/eggs/your-questions-about-double-yolk-eggs-answered">are more likely</a> to be doubles. And distribution networks tend to box up eggs by size and flock - so if you find one you&rsquo;re much more likely to find another.</p>
<p>This is to the extent that <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2943313/M-S-cracks-formula-boxes-super-eggs-guarantee-double-yolks.html">M&amp;S started offering</a> boxes of 100% guaranteed double yolkers for sale. Admittedly at a cost, because to satisfy the guarantee the eggs needed to be &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candling">candled</a>&rdquo; first.</p>
<p>Besides 9 out of 12 isn&rsquo;t anywhere near the most extreme recorded case. One of my fellow countryfolk apparently once opened a continuous sequence of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/british-woman-cracks-open-29-doubleyolked-eggs-in-a-row-2304092.html">29 out of 29 double-yolked eggs</a> (not, of course, from guaranteed double-yolk boxes, that would be even more irrelevant news than this post). And as for a single egg, well, the current world record appears to be an egg that contained an astonishing <a href="https://people.howstuffworks.com/why-are-people-superstitious-about-double-yolked-eggs.htm">nine yolks</a>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-totally-shameless/">Generative AI Is Totally Shameless. I Want to Be It</a></p>
<p>Paul Ford writes entertainingly about generative AI as being a shameless technology, for better or worse.</p>
<p>But what chance did it ever have when its creators and owners also lack that quality?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hilariously, the makers of ChatGPT—AI people in general—keep trying to teach these systems shame, in the form of special preambles, rules, guidance&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the current crop of AI leadership is absolutely unsuited to this work. They are themselves shameless, grasping at venture capital and talking about how their products will run the world, asking for billions or even trillions in investment. They insist we remake civilization around them and promise it will work out. But how are they going to teach a computer to behave if they can’t?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/07/23/think-about-your.html">Think about your actual rather than idealised office when deciding whether to go into work</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When thinking about the &ldquo;should you force employees to come into the office on the basis that it&rsquo;s a better environment for junior employees to learn and progress in?&rdquo; debate, <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/official-myths">Mandy Brown reminds us</a> to not inadvertently used some idealised version of what an office actually is as our yardstick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mistake from here is assuming that offices are naturally better at building those kinds of social and supportive structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there’s a kind of mythical office that remote culture is being compared to, a place where everyone is welcomed, where collaboration and support is easy-going and automatic, where everyone is always whiteboarding or talking in the hallways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s kind of astonishing to see how much this presumed office utopia has become implicit, given we have literal decades of satire about offices as locales of poorly lit, soul-sucking, isolated work, where you are more likely to be abused by your boss than sponsored by them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It feels to me like a good number of cognitive errors can be avoided by thinking hard about what the appropriate - usually meaning realistic - baseline to compare something to actually is.</p>
<p>An example from our recent past:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t compare any potential harms of &ldquo;getting a Covid vaccination&rdquo; against the potential harms of &ldquo;not getting a Covid vaccination and everything else about your life remains the same&rdquo;. However miniscule the risk of getting a Covid vaccination is - and for the avoidance of doubt it appeared to be <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html">extremely low</a> for the vast majority of people - it&rsquo;ll always come out worse in that comparison.</p>
<p>Instead a much more appropriate comparison is to consider any risks of &ldquo;getting a Covid vaccination and less likely to thus get Covid&rdquo; against the risks of &ldquo;not getting a Covid vaccination and your increased likelihood of then contracting and/or transmitting Covid&rdquo;.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/07/21/disco-elysium-is.html">Disco Elysium is one of the most atmospheric, most unique, games I&#39;ve played</a></h1>

			 <p>🎮 Played <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/disco-elysium-the-final-cut">Disco Elysium - The Final Cut</a>.</p>
<p>This was the first time I&rsquo;d played a game quite like this, if indeed there are all that many games quite like this. It was quite an experience.</p>
<p>Set in Revachol, a somewhat failing post-communist state, you wake up in a hotel room with a debilitating hangover and no memory of, well, very much at all. Some might say it&rsquo;s therefore quite an accurate simulation of parts of some of our real lives.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Please note that all the screenshots I&rsquo;m sharing here are from <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/gallery/disco-elysium-screenshots/">RPGfan.com</a> - I was far too engaged to remember to take my own.)</p>
<p>Slowly, as you point-and-click your way around your new locale, you find ways to piece together what happened the previous night, and indeed some of the previous nights of your life. It transpires that you&rsquo;re a detective who is there to solve a murder. Much of this is done via talking to other people, many of whom are less than friendly - particularly those who are in reality running the town through tactics of intimidation.</p>
<p>There is an incredible amount of reading to be done. There <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-voice-acting-console-release">over a million words</a> worth of text all in all, although in the deluxe version of the game - &ldquo;The Final Cut&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s all voice-acted out as well if you prefer to listen than read. Apparently a million words is like reading The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit twice through. But, don&rsquo;t panic, you won&rsquo;t end up needing to read them all. In fact I doubt you&rsquo;d even have the option to come close to doing so in a single playthrough even if you wanted to.</p>
<p>So the dialogues are lengthy. But they&rsquo;re also meaningful. I&rsquo;ve only played it through once, but your choices of how to respond at least appear to make a real difference to how people treat you later in the game, what opportunities are available to you and, I suspect, the ending.</p>
<p>I soon learned the error of my ways in following that classic RPG-style tactic of mindlessly working my way through every single dialogue option, saying everything the game allowed me to say in the hope the responses would provide clues. That doesn&rsquo;t work well in the world of Revachol any more than it would in real life. So I started taking my choices more seriously, in order to further the in estimation but also to manage my own (character&rsquo;s) brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brain management&rdquo; is a big part of how you develop your character in this game. Firstly, your survival depends on you managing to sustain both your physical and mental health. At first I found my character losing all motivation for life, let alone detective work, which ended up with me living homeless, under a bridge, rarely sober. That&rsquo;s the end of the game if you&rsquo;re not a little careful. Luckily you can save your game pretty much whenever you want so I didn&rsquo;t have to start all the way over.</p>
<p>You can temporarily boost your physical or mental resilience in an emergency via taking recreational drugs, if you have any and don&rsquo;t object to doing so - although if your police partner is there they are not the sort of person who&rsquo;s impressed by such behaviour. And there will be a price to pay in some other aspect of your wellbeing.</p>
<p>For a more permanent form of self-development, you earn points as you progress through the game which you can channel into the development of your brain and body. There are 24 attributes such that fit under 4 categories - intellect, psyche, physique and motorics - that you can elect to improve depending on how you wish to develop your character. Some examples: logic, drama, empathy, pain threshold, reaction speed. Each attribute has various available skill levels.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Your brain state may then influence the choices you can make during dialogue, how other people react to you, how successful you in any actions you choose to make or even what actions or side-quests are available to you - after all you can&rsquo;t dig into a clue if you never noticed it in the first place.</p>
<p>Your starting set of attributes is dependent on which archetype you choose for your character pre-game. You can opt for a physically strong brawny detective, one with high emotional intelligence or a Sherlock Holmes style character with a high IQ sort of setup.</p>
<p>Another way in which your brain is relevant comes via the mechanism of thoughts. Throughout the game you&rsquo;ll pick up semblances of ideas. You can choose to dwell on these thoughts, to research them, to &ldquo;do your own research&rdquo; as it were. But, like reality, you can only focus on a few at any given time, even when you get over the immediate anguish of your hangover.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These thoughts have quite abstract names &ldquo;Anti object task force&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rigorous self-critique&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Jamrock shuffle&rdquo;, so you never quite know for sure how thinking these thoughts is going to affect you. Some will improve your abilities. Some might make you worse at something. Others are neutral. This seems an accurate reflection of the risks of Googling too hard on some topics in the real world.</p>
<p>Reading books can also have an effect. The final main modifier to your abilities come from your decisions around what to wear. Your wardrobe grows over time as you find or otherwise acquire a large range of outfits each of which can influence your abilities a little.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on here, but, at least in my experience, little to panic about. I certainly didn&rsquo;t make the optimum choices but did just fine once I got over my quitting and living under a bridge phase.</p>
<p>The one thing I&rsquo;d note is that at times the game makes clear that if you follow a certain action or go to a certain place then there&rsquo;s no going back. To be fair it&rsquo;s very explicit. But they&rsquo;re warnings you should heed.</p>
<p>You may well end up with a vast collection of sub-missions as you play, some of which are pertinent to the main quest of murder-solving, others of which are merely interesting diversions. You might do yourself out of the ability to work on a few of the latter type if you disregard such warnings. Unfortunately via being a bit careless around this I failed to complete one of the larger side-quests available in at least the deluxe version of the game - to re-instantiate a successful incarnation of communism (other ideologies are available).</p>
<p>All in all, this was a fascinating and absolutely engaging game of a type I&rsquo;ve never played before. It was at times slow, bewildering, or frustrating as probability determined I failed to accomplish something I wanted to - some actions' success are dependent on a classic Dungeons-and-Dragons style roll of a dice with the threshold you need to achieve being modified by your character&rsquo;s personal abilities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s some parts that could be termed tedious or depressing, but I imagine that&rsquo;s deliberate. It conveyed the atmosphere of the location very well. Indeed this was one of the most successfully atmospheric games I&rsquo;ve played.</p>
<p>It was, in short, a real, deep and intense experience and one I&rsquo;m glad I had. A real example of the capability of games to be art. I certainly agree with the many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium#Reception">accolades</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium#Awards">awards</a> the game won back in the day. I&rsquo;d be very keen to see if any more examples of this kind of genre and approach are out there.</p>

			 <p>Large parts of the world are on fire - metaphorically speaking at least, but I&rsquo;d not rule out a literal interpretation entirely - as a bug in some software from <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-gb/">Crowdstrike</a> has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo">inadvertently ruined the operations</a> of various institutions from the worlds of banking, travel, healthcare and beyond. You might not even get paid on time as some payroll processes failed.</p>
<p>What is Crowdstrike? Well, per <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo">the BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crowdstrike is known for producing antivirus software, intended to prevent hackers from causing this very type of disruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>Apparently they fixed whatever is wrong, but each and every affected device needs to be individually, manually, seen to.</p>
<p>One solution that is apparently worth trying is the same one that fixes almost every other computer issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is advising clients to try a classic method to get things working - turning it off and on again - in some cases up to 15 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We just need the whole world to turn their computers of and on again 15 times.</p>
<p>Crowdstrike last reported having only 24,000 customers. World-disrupting incidents like this just highlight how fragile the way we&rsquo;ve arranged our technology to operate in can be.</p>

			 <p>It finally happened. My trusty personal laptop died. To be fair I can&rsquo;t complain; it&rsquo;s had a good innings, surviving around 11 years. It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaio">Sony Vaio</a>, which means it <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/computers/vaio-laptops">long outlasted</a> the part of Sony&rsquo;s business that manufactured it. It was brought back from the dead once already thanks to a local IT shop, but the fix was impermanent and isn&rsquo;t worth repeating.</p>
<p>Technology sure has moved on over the decade-plus since I got it. Whilst it could still cope with the basics, it might have gotten too slow to use without frustration after one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10">Windows 10</a> update or another had I not discovered the virtues of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, having <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/08/27/the-trials-and.html">installed Linux Mint</a> a while ago.</p>
<p>The performance difference was night and day. No more waiting around for hourglasses to spin or 10 minute boot-up times. And also no more <a href="https://ms.codes/en-gb/blogs/windows/how-to-change-app-recommendation-settings-windows-10">sponsored &ldquo;recommendations</a>&rdquo; for apps I&rsquo;d never want. No more extremely low quality unsolicited &ldquo;news&rdquo; in the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/">Start menu</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/269331/how-to-disable-all-of-windows-10s-built-in-advertising/">turn much of that off</a> to be fair. But, come on, even the once-sacred, once-pure pastime of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2006/02/2968/">many an office worker</a> - sol.exe - was <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/225128/you-dont-have-to-pay-20-a-year-for-solitaire-and-minesweeper-on-windows-10/">infused with 30 second long video advertisements</a>. Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, you can still play their solitaire and minesweeper ad-free if you want to. For $20 a year.</p>
<p>For anyone else who has old tech that&rsquo;s too slow for the more mainstream operating systems, yet correctly detests unnecessary e-waste, I strongly advise you give Linux a go. Despite its reputation, these days if things go smoothly it&rsquo;s not an immense technical challenge to install, and it&rsquo;s certainly not hard to use for day-to-day work and play once it is installed. At least if you go for one of the distributions that prioritises ease of use and/or consistency with the computing experiences of other operating systems (<a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> being one of those, many other options exist). So you&rsquo;ve not got a lot to lose if you alternative is throwing the machine away.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s no shortage of high quality Linux software to replace your Windows apps. Much of it is free of charge and it&rsquo;s often extremely easy to install thanks to various pre-installed graphical package managers. And in the case that you do need to run Windows programs, technologies like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> might get you there.</p>
<p>I soon learned to enjoy Linux more than Windows. I&rsquo;d set it up as a dual boot system but found that I never actually booted to Windows. Thus I figured that this time I&rsquo;d go out of my way to buy a laptop designed for and preinstalled with Linux to replace it. I imagined it might even be a cheaper option give there&rsquo;d be no Windows licensing costs for manufacturers to pay. As much as I&rsquo;d enjoy some £5000 power-beast it&rsquo;s just not going to happen right now short of a lottery win.</p>
<p>Turns out I was very wrong, unless I just didn&rsquo;t search well enough.</p>
<p>Not all that many companies seem to sell new machines with Linux pre-installed on. <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> seem to be amongst the most famous dedicated providers of Linux offerings. But all are substantially above $1000, even without considering any shipping costs to the UK.  <a href="https://junocomputers.com/">Juno Computers</a> are another option. Their &ldquo;<a href="https://junocomputers.com/product-category/laptops/entry-level/">entry level</a>&rdquo; laptops appear to start from £970. Although actually if you click around enough you can find some with older processors that <a href="https://junocomputers.com/product/nyx-14-v5/">start from £655</a>. <a href="https://starlabs.systems/">StarLabs</a> are another provider, their laptops start at £969.60.</p>
<p>Of the more mainstream computer providers, <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-uk">Dell</a> also do some. They even <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-uk/000131655/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-on-your-dell-pc">offer instructions</a> as to how to replace the OS their other laptops come with with Linux which is very cool. But their famous XPS range that has the option of coming with Ubuntu Linux are all above £1000 as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Why so expensive when you can go to some high street shop and get a (admittedly not great) Windows laptop for like £300? To be honest I haven&rsquo;t done the research to know the answer to this question, which almost certainly has an an actual answer. But heaven forbid I do my homework. So I&rsquo;m just going to make guesses, that it&rsquo;s one or more of these potential reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux laptops are not at all popular. It&rsquo;s a niche market. It&rsquo;s much more expensive per item to make things fewer people buy.</li>
<li>Maybe they tend to have better hardware? I guess it&rsquo;s probably nerd types that tend to want them. Perhaps they&rsquo;re more likely than average to care about performance.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re intending to support your customer&rsquo;s usage of your machine then there would presumably be ongoing costs for that. It must be harder (more expensive) to find agents who can help people solve Linux problems than Windows.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;d also have to make sure that drivers etc. for all the hardware you include exist in Linux - and write and maintain them if not.</li>
<li>Most Windows PC manufacturers and distributors appear to pre-install a load of truly garbage software that you probably don&rsquo;t want on the system before selling it to you. Clearly this is not for altruistic reasons. Maybe the kickback they get from doing that is so high that it more than makes up for the cost of Windows.</li>
<li>Perhaps the people that want Linux laptops <em>really</em> want Linux laptops so will pay more? And far be it from any company to not exploit every possible £ of revenue opportunity.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m sure OEMs don&rsquo;t pay the same for Windows as us mere people do. Perhaps Windows is very cheap for them, or they even receive benefits from Microsoft for ensuring more folk get into their ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless it seems like a potentially missed opportunity. You can buy (low-performing) Chromebooks for not much more than £100. But I don&rsquo;t think I could live with a Google operating system, and I&rsquo;d assume a lack of software choice from the point of those of us who enjoy tinkering, who love options screens with 100 preferences, who occasionally might want to do our own coding.</p>
<p>So, despite my philosophical and in-practice preferences, I&rsquo;m opting for some sub-£500 Windows machine. In any case, there&rsquo;s always the option to replace Windows with Linux, which I can totally see myself doing in short order. But I guess I will experiment with Windows 11 for a bit first given I&rsquo;ve never used it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>That decision does mean I&rsquo;ll probably want to dedicate some time to reading and acting on a ton of articles like &lsquo;<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-disable-annoying-ads-on-windows-11">How to disable annoying ads on Windows 11</a>&rsquo;  and &ldquo;<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tune-up-utilities/40364/how-to-remove-bloatware-from-your-new-pc">How to remove bloatware from your new PC</a>&rdquo; to try and minimise the semi-spyware and advertising networks that apparently infuse Microsoft&rsquo;s latest creation, an apparently ever more <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">enshittifying</a> iteration.</p>
<p>Ads in the Start menu, in <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/how-to/block-ads-in-windows-11">File Explorer</a>, maybe even in <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1814672/microsoft-ads-show-up-in-start-menu-in-early-microsoft-tests.html">Settings</a> for crying out loud - although perhaps fair to note that most of the latter ads are  likely for Microsoft services that are supposed to improve your experience, such as OneDrive - if you&rsquo;re willing to pay. In any case, I like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2049502/microsofts-incessant-windows-ads-are-getting-out-of-control.html">Alaina Yee&rsquo;s take</a> in PC World:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I’m not in marketing, but if an ad causes a seasoned tech journalist to briefly think his PC got infected with malware, maybe your advertising approach needs improving.</p>

			 <p>The recent UK election, with its Labour landside, brought a new record for Britain&rsquo;s youngest serving MP. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Carling">Sam Carling</a>, a new MP for Labour in North West Cambridgeshire, is 22 years old. This makes him the first MP to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/06/labour-sam-carling-22-first-mp-born-in-21st-century">born in the 21st century</a>. This comes after he scraped victory by just 39 votes against a Conservative MP who had held the seat for nearly 20 years and had a majority of 25,983 in the last general election. Impressive stuff.</p>
<p>As wild as that seems when I think back to my own experience of being 22 - which was definitely not compatible with running any part of anything, let alone the country - I&rsquo;m excited to see how he goes. After all, I usually find that young people make voting decisions I like better.</p>
<p>At the other end of the age spectrum, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Gale">Sir Roger Gale</a>, from the Conservative party in the constituency of Herne Bay and Sandwich, is currently <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-2024-mp-oldest-youngest-sam-carling-b2575211.html">the oldest MP</a>. He was elected in 1983 - 19 years before Carling was born - and is currently 80 years old.</p>

<p>The results in terms of seats, as per <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/crggn4j2lm0t">the BBC</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on under the surface of these numbers, not all of which is reassuring. For one, the &ldquo;landslide&rdquo; is a lot more landslidey in terms of seats than votes. But we can surely take a couple of days to celebrate the chance, however small, that we have a new set of people governing us who maybe, just maybe, can improve the lives of our citizens along with what remains of our country.</p>
<p>Whilst he retained his seat our previous PM, Rishi Sunak,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1xnzlzz99o"> has apologised </a>and is going to stand down as Conservative leader.</p>
<p>Other Tory VIPs were less fortunate, losing their seats entirely. That list includes ex PM Liz Truss, who lost her huge 32,988 majority, as well as Grant Shapps, Penny Mordaunt, Alex Chalk and Jacob-Rees Mogg.</p>
<p>Labour lost one potential seat to the excommunicated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/05/jeremy-corbyn-re-elected-in-islington-north-for-first-time-as-independent-mp">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/23/sunak-announces-that.html">General Election Day today</a> here in the UK. Us UK folk should all leave the house and go and vote, vote vote!</p>
<p>Find your local polling station <a href="https://wheredoivote.co.uk/">here</a>. They&rsquo;re supposed to be open from 7AM through to 10PM. You have to go to the specific one you&rsquo;ve been assigned to.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to take some photo ID, as foolish as introducing that requirement <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/03/tom-hunts-predicament.html">probably was</a>. What counts as legitimate photo ID is detailed <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/voting-and-elections/voter-id/accepted-forms-photo-id">here</a>. It&rsquo;s the sort of requirement you really have to comply with today, even if you want to campaign against it afterwards.</p>
<p>Also you might as well take your polling card if you have it - but no worries if you lost it, they can look you up there and then in the polling station in order to let you exercise your democratic rights.</p>
<p>If anyone who has a postal vote they forgot to post then you can take those to the polling station in person too (but do take it!).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too ill / unexpectedly away / have lost all your photo ID then you still have up to 5pm today to apply for an emergency proxy vote if you have someone you can trust to carry out your vote on your behalf. Do that by contacting the electoral services team at your local council ASAP, definitely before 5PM, the details of which can be found via <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/your-election-information">this website</a>.</p>
<p>Nothing is inevitable. And if you&rsquo;re skeptical that taking action can take a difference, well, not taking an action certainly won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📺 Watched  &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/dispatches/seasons/2024/episodes/8">Can AI Steal Your Vote?</a>&rdquo; documentary.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/can-ai-steal-your-vote-dispatches/on-demand/75935-001">Channel 4 documentary </a> from their <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/dispatches">Dispatches series</a> whereby they found 12 households who had in common the fact that they claimed to be undecided as to who to vote for in the forthcoming <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/23/sunak-announces-that.html">UK general election</a>.</p>
<p>They were then enrolled into an experiment where they were told that they were going to be shown various political content - in the modern style of Facebook posts, Tiktok vids, and the like - on a new social network for an experiment that was designed to test their reactions to political content that might be shown during the election campaign.</p>
<p>Of course the twist, which wasn&rsquo;t revealed to the participants until after the fact, is that some of this content (hopefully) isn&rsquo;t actually going to be shown. Because it was AI-generated deepfakes that the show&rsquo;s creators had come up with.</p>
<p>Typically these deepfakes consisted of video or audio based on real footage or recordings, but altered so that the person concerned - Sunak or Starmer - appeared to be saying something that they never did. Subsequent comments or misleading posts from fake social media users also appeared the timeline.</p>
<p>So for instance we see Sunak apparently claiming that he&rsquo;s going to save the NHS by introducing a £35 fee to see your doctor (not true) and Starmer saying that he&rsquo;s going to ensure immigrants get top priority with regard to welfare and housing (also not true). There were also supposed leaks where the Prime Ministerial candidates seemed to be caught saying things like that they only tell voters what they want to hear or that they&rsquo;re cross some nefarious plan or other got leaked.</p>
<p>6 households were exposed to fake content designed to push them towards voting for the Conservatives, and 6 to content designed to encourage them to vote Labour. At the end of the &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; they then have the participants (fake) vote in the way that they would now feel inclined to in the real election - Labour or Conservative - in order to see whether there&rsquo;s evidence that being exposed to the fake content made a difference to their voting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not much of a spoiler to say that - contrary to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge&rsquo;s Law</a> - this exposure did have a sizeable affect. OK, I don&rsquo;t think it was the necessarily the most rigorous of experiments, but it was nonetheless pretty compelling to watch, and a fair warning to us all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a overly surprising result. So many of us get our information from social media post style output in this form, whose primary intent is usually to influence us. There&rsquo;s no reason that fake-but-seems real content would affect us any less than actually real content if done well.  Particularly when this content has been actively designed by experts to be as influential and manipulative as possible, which is the scenario faced both by the participants here, and potentially us all in the real world. After all it&rsquo;s good, perhaps even our duty, to seek out information about who we&rsquo;re voting for, to learn what they stand for, what they&rsquo;re likely to do to our country. It just doesn&rsquo;t work out so well when the information that&rsquo;s available is lies, indistinguishable at first glance from the truth.</p>
<p>So the participants were in no way behaving oddly, stupidly or in a way deserving mockery. At least a few of them did actually question whether the content was real and true at times. Some looked into a couple of the issues concerned - there was no restriction on what other sources participants could consult -  and found no other evidence that some of what they&rsquo;d seen was true, particularly some of the more outlandish supposed footage. At least one of them works in tech and AI as a job. They were all pretty humble about the experience after the fact. But even with all that taken into account, the claim is that the continued and varied exposure to it had some effect.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting comments after it was revealed to the participants that much of the content they&rsquo;d seen was generative AI fakery was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participant: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m still fuming about charging us £35 for an [doctor&rsquo;s] appointment and it&rsquo;s not even true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presenter: &lsquo;In a way scarily there&rsquo;s a bit of you that might sort of remember that and think maybe it is true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Participant: &lsquo;Exactly that. It wasn&rsquo;t so much now we know it&rsquo;s fake but the anger is real.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presenter: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t unthink that in a way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Participant: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, despite the fact they now knew what they&rsquo;d seen wasn&rsquo;t real, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they at the time they first saw it they felt powerful emotions - anger, disgust, fury - the memory of which perhaps unconsciously sticks with them. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/23727322231195907?journalCode=bbsa">Emotions affect behaviour</a>, and you can&rsquo;t rewrite the past. I suppose there is some risk of course that even showing the deepfake content on this show - which they frequently do, albeit it&rsquo;s systematically watermarked as not being real - could have some effect on the rest of us for a similar reason - let alone if out-of-context clips get circulated or manipulated in exactly the way the show warned about.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a great deal about how to avoid falling prey to this stuff. Perhaps because we don&rsquo;t really know very much about how to defend this potential onslaught. As one of the experts notes, there&rsquo;s rarely even time to debunk any given falsehood, even if it was felt that that would do all that much good. Recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">Brandolini&rsquo;s law</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which will be ever more the case now uncountable reams of bullshit can be automatically generated by anyone via AI.</p>
<p>So really the main advice was the fairly obvious (but sometimes hard to remember to do) idea that if you see something that makes you feel a certain way or believe something new - and especially if you feel compelled to share it with other people - at least try to double check the source. It&rsquo;s awkward to say and none are perfect, but some sources do remain inherently more reputable than others. And if only one or two sources are reporting some clearly world-shattering news then you might be extra sceptical that it ever happened. For example, no British newspaper of record is going to forget to mention a complete revolution in, some would say destruction of, the basic principles of how the NHS works</p>
<p>The whole show seems to be freely available on YouTube - legitimately! - so here we go:</p>

<p>France&rsquo;s far right is in pole position after the first round of parliamentary elections that confirmed their dominance in French politics and brought them to the gates of power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8009e2z4xlo">Macron&rsquo;s absolutely bizarre decision</a> to unnecessarily call an election - seemingly on the basis that his opponents seemed to be doing better than he hoped - appears to be panning out exactly as awfully as most sane people I know predicted. It&rsquo;s a pretty unprecedented situation for France.</p>

			 <p>Several Conservative party candidates and officials are in trouble for, perhaps in a desperate measure to get rich before they <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/14/the-day-has.html">lose their jobs</a> on <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/23/sunak-announces-that.html">July 4th</a>, by betting on the date of the general election using their insider knowledge before the public announcement was made. This is of course <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/475fc6ea-dca2-4c60-ad0c-a12082a6428a">illegal</a>,  potentially something you could even go to prison for.</p>
<p>Right now there are at least <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1915326/rishi-sunak-general-election-betting">6 named Conservative candidates and officials</a> being investigated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Craig Williams, the Prime Minister’s parliamentary aide.</li>
<li>Laura Saunders, Conservative candidate (who is married to the Conservative&rsquo;s directory of campaigning).</li>
<li>Tony Lee, Conservative Party director of campaigning</li>
<li>Nick Mason, the Conservative Party’s chief data officer.</li>
<li>Russell George, the Welsh Conservative member of the Senedd</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1915185/general-election-metropolitan-police-betting">6 police officers</a> are apparently also being looked on for the same matter.</p>
<p>Showing their ability to never totally come out of someone else&rsquo;s scandal unscathed, there&rsquo;s also a Labour candidate, Kevin Craig, who is being investigated for better on the Conservatives to win his constituency. I suppose he might have gotten reasonable odds on that given the landslide in the other direction that&rsquo;s currently expected (at least at a nationwide level, I haven&rsquo;t checked out his area in particular).</p>
<p>So another day, another (mostly) Tory scandal. It&rsquo;s not like it was even for serious money. We&rsquo;re generally talking about bets in the order of £100. Apparently bookies will typically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/world/europe/uk-election-betting-scandal.html">only take fairly small bets</a> on this sort of thing as it&rsquo;s a fairly small market that they&rsquo;re less confident that they have an edge over punters than in the case of sports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible more names might come out soon. Newsnight reported that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clkkyx9rxzzo">up to 15 Conservative candidates and officials</a> are being looked into by the Gambling Commission. George Osborne has said <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/tory-party-election-betting-scandal-what-we-know-155706718.html">that around 40 people</a> in total would have been aware of the election date in advance</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/28/rory-stewarts-book.html">Rory Stewart&#39;s book reveals the total dysfunction behind Britain&#39;s political system</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/28/rory-stewarts-book.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-28 07:13:00 &#43;0100">Jun 28, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787332713">Politics on the Edge</a> by Rory Stewart.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Stewart">Rory Stewart</a>&rsquo;s memoir of his time before, but mostly during, his time serving as a British member of parliament. That episode that commenced in 2010 when he was elected to serve as as part of the Conservative party.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had a privileged upbringing which has turned him into something of a stereotypical British posh boy in presentation. Despite that though, he has somehow apparently remained a lot more sane, a lot more human-seeming, that most of his often-equally-as-privileged contemporaries have managed to do.</p>
<p>He identifies as a centrist, moderate, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-nation_conservatism">one-nation Tory</a> -  who holds some more traditional small-c conservative views, including much respect for British traditions and institutions (political, royal or otherwise) and the notion of public service, in comparison to his <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/the-conservative-leadership.html">culture-war-addled</a> modern <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/23/the-conservative-party.html">very unconservative</a> Conservative contemporaries.</p>
<p>Since then, he&rsquo;s stood for the leadership of the Conservative party - yes, he could have in theory been our prime minister - as well as, as an independent, the mayor of London. Neither of those two attempts worked out for him,  but I do remember his famous strategy of asking his potential voters to let him <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18227376.watch-rory-stewarts-bizarre-campaign-trick-trending-social-media/">come and stay the night at their homes</a>.</p>
<p>Why stand as an independent? Well, in 2019 he was excommunicated from the Conservative party via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_Stewart#Sitting_as_an_independent_and_resignation">withdrawal of the whip for the crime of voting against</a> what he saw as the first step towards a devastating no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>Some of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_suspension_of_rebel_Conservative_MPs">fellow travelers</a> had the whip restored in due time, but Rory in any case felt compelled to quit the party entirely given that the only alternative would mean he&rsquo;d have to serve under Boris Johnson, a politician who ranks amongst the highest on his list of asinine dangerous fools that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be anywhere near the levers of power.</p>
<p>Nonetheless,  his years of experience have allowed him to present to his readership a fascinating, albeit extremely depressing, insider&rsquo;s look at how the wheels of British government turn in practice. This undoubtedly goes some way to explaining the current <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63659936">abject state</a> of the country.</p>
<p>Most of his Parliamentary peers are shallow, tetchy, over-ambitious, confrontational, incompetent and ignorant. To be fair, the system seems designed to keep them that way, with ministers switching roles - he himself held 5 ministerial positions between 2015 and 2019 - and job titles so rapidly at whims of their leadership there&rsquo;s no chance to actually build up any expertise and skill, even if they did care enough to do so. Besides, why bother learning anything when given the power of the leadership and the whips under the current system it&rsquo;s very rare that politicians are even enabled to vote with their conscience? They do what they&rsquo;re told by their leadership. Or they suffer.</p>
<p>He name names, tells personal anecdotes and exposes huge structural flaws within the system in a manner that suggests he&rsquo;ll never be invited back to the Conservative party. Not that he shows no real signs of wanting to be, at least in its current state. Things got so bad at one point during his time serving that he had a moment where he no longer wanted to be alive. At moments he saw himself starting to behave, or thinking he needed to behave, in the same ways as his despised colleagues, leading to feelings of shame and self-loathing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s particularly vicious about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>&rsquo;s immense variety of failings, and not all that much more impressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss">Liz Truss</a>. There&rsquo;s a couple of politicians he seems to have retained some respect for - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May">Theresa May</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauke">David Gauke</a> -  but of course even they have to battle against a system that appears designed to thwart their better-intentioned moves.</p>
<p>He retains a sense of humour. The book is laugh-out-loud funny at times, especially for folk like me who often find absurdity hilarious. But it&rsquo;s one of those situations where it&rsquo;s only funny until you remember it&rsquo;s real. The dysfunctional system it describes is the same one that holds such tremendous power over you and your fellow citizens.</p>
<p>In that sense it&rsquo;s also a very depressing book, infused with the author&rsquo;s own despair and frustration. I don&rsquo;t get the sense that Stewart really tries to give hope that there&rsquo;s much redemption for the system beyond burning it all down and starting from scratch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to stop me voting in the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/23/sunak-announces-that.html">forthcoming general election</a>, and I very much hope it doesn&rsquo;t stop you either - but I certainly understand the people who react to these stories with a sense of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; helplessness. But, as is almost always the case, whilst playing an active role may or may not improve the world, doing nothing is certainly not going to change anything.</p>

Ideal for the inveterate hobbyist tinkerer who wants to play with shiny new nerd toys but isn&rsquo;t in a position to invest a lot of money into the act.</p>
<p>Usually, but not always, the free tier is offered as a potential gateway to a paid tier. That&rsquo;s often worth considering doing, if nothing else then to support the services you like. But the list is constrained such that the free offering must be both long term and useful.</p>
<p>These are all as-a-service offerings rather than self-hosted things. You can easily help out by contributing to the list.</p>
<p>My personal use-case for it this time was finding a way to implement a contact form on a static website. It saved me a lot of time and effort vs Googling and hoping for the best.</p>

			 <p>📧 Reading the <a href="https://benansell.substack.com/">Political Calculus</a> newsletter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/23/sunak-announces-that.html">election season</a> madness here in the UK, so I&rsquo;m rapidly ingesting anything and everything on the topic to a, hopefully, only slightly unhealthy degree.</p>
<p>This (free) newsletter - &ldquo;on the connections between politics and the economy&rdquo; - is written by Ben Ansell. He&rsquo;s a political scientist who wrote the book &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781541702097?title=Why+Politics+Fails&amp;author=Ben+Ansell&amp;cover_id=167461">Why Politics Fails</a>&rdquo;, which has already made it to my near infinite length &ldquo;want to read&rdquo; list, given the state of the country. Well, the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://benansell.substack.com/p/the-saturn-campaign">latest edition I read</a> focuses on the perceived generational war that the Conservatives have seemed to be intent to pursue in recent times. Young people have seemingly declared war on the Conservatives in response, at least in terms of voting preferences for the upcoming general election.

<p>Stolen test data and NHS numbers published by hospital hackers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(From <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9ww90j9dj8o">The BBC</a>)</p>
<p>A group called Qilin has shared 400GB of private NHS data on the Darknet, thought <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/russian-hackers-publish-london-hospitals-blood-test-data/">to include</a> patient identifiers and blood test results. This seems to be the result of an unpaid ransomware demand, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/20/qilin_our_plan_was_to/">allegedly for $50 million</a>. The action also caused potentially dangerous disruption to thousands of medical appointments.</p>
<p>Qilin is a ransomware group <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a54f9c2e-bf5a-464d-94d2-8b08285a148d">that popped up in 2022</a> and is thought by many to work from Russia.</p>
<p>The data was not stolen directly from NHS systems but rather from an organisation called <a href="https://www.synnovis.co.uk/">Synnovis</a> who provides pathology services for the NHS. Again this shows that it&rsquo;s really only the weakest link that matters. Hackers only have to be successful once.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far from the first healthcare organisation to be attacked. Just a couple of years ago the NHS once again saw <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62506039">one of the organisations who provides it with IT services</a> attacked.  Last year saw 70TB worth of sensitive data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/10/uk-hacks-public-sector-nhs-ransomware/">from Barts Health NHS Trust</a> held to ransom as well as details of over 1 million patients threatened by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-patient-data-attack-b2364202.html">an attack </a> against the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this year United Healthcare decided to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/22/unitedhealth-paid-ransom-to-bad-actors-says-patient-data-was-compromised-in-change-healthcare-cyberattack.html">actually pay the ransom</a>, suggested to represent <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/2024/unitedhealth-pays-22-million-to-ransomware-group-behind-change-healthcare-cyber-attack">$22 million worth of Bitcoins</a>, when their subsidiary, Change Healthcare was attacked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all rather terrifying. At least whilst it feels like there&rsquo;s little indication we really know how to stop it happening.</p>

In the interests of balance, whilst he did think Tate was an &ldquo;important voice for the emasculated&rdquo;, he didn&rsquo;t offer <em>unqualified</em> support, deeming him to be at times &ldquo;over the top&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/clarkson-s-farm">Clarkson&rsquo;s Farm</a>.</p>
<p>A show so fantastical that, at times, it makes Jeremy Clarkson look almost like a sympathetic character.</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s bounced back from whatever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson#Controversies">his last offensive comment</a> or terrible political opinion was to grace a large number of screens in the UK as he &ldquo;runs&rdquo; a farm called &ldquo;Diddly Squat&rdquo;. Remember &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-simple-life/seasons/all">The Simple Life</a>&rdquo; show all those years ago where the hook was that Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie would endevour to do whatever was regarded at the time as a nasty, messy or generally subservient job - you know, the kind of jobs many of us routinely do but someone with in their stratum of fame and wealth never had to learn how to do? This is kind of like a version of the farm episode from that, except that the celebrity know-nothing concerned owns the place.</p>
<p>It has less structural sexism or ageism (excluding anything Jeremy might say), but the same ethos of privileged person who doesn&rsquo;t really have a clue about what he&rsquo;s doing bumbling around doing things badly whilst the normies who really know how it&rsquo;s done - because it&rsquo;s what they have had to become proficient at in order to live a hopefully decent life - try to save him from himself. It&rsquo;s usually a light-hearted enough show so stuff turns out OK in the end, with the exception of some upsetting animal deaths.</p>
<p>The surrounding cast, his employees and contractors are, are pretty universally entertaining and seemingly nice, rational, kind of normal people who get openly exasperated having to deal with someone like Jeremy, even though he is their boss. With great accents in some cases.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of charm here, and even some references to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/09/uk-farmers-consider-quitting-after-extreme-wet-weather-and-low-profits">important issues that are currently causing great stress</a> to the type of farmers who are not TV celebrities - weather, costs, income etc. - if you can overlook the host&rsquo;s history and don&rsquo;t mind listening to a few standard rants about political correctness gone mad, government overeach (some of the latter may even be fair, I&rsquo;m no expert) and the like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The many innovations corporations have devised to get you to pay more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only gotten through a couple of the articles (which are freely available) so far, <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-06-11-what-we-owe/">What We Owe</a> and <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-06-10-one-click-economy/">The One-Click Economy</a>, but the rest are on my list.</p>

			 <p>Britain has something of a penchant for novelty candidates in its elections. We&rsquo;re regularly treated to the sight of the 6000 year old Recyclon leader wearing a bucket on his head - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Binface">Count Binface</a> - standing next to some important luminary from a more mainstream political party.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a classic, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YH0FC/">courtesy of Reuters</a>, from one time our disgraced ex-Prime Minister won his seat back in 2019.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fun fact - Count Binface used to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Buckethead">Lord Buckethead</a>, before some earthbound copyright got in the way.</p>
<p>Anyway, entirely unrelated to the Count or Sesame Street, the <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/elections/parl.brighton-pavilion.2024-07-04/brighton-pavilion/">Brighton Pavilion ballot</a> is an interesting one this year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First off there&rsquo;s a classic entry by a candidate for the <a href="https://www.loonyparty.com/">Official Monster Loony Raving Party</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Monster_Raving_Loony_Party">42-year old party</a> founded by Screaming Lord Sutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vote for insanity&rdquo; is their slogan, which admittedly doesn&rsquo;t greatly distinguish them from several of their opponents. In fact some of their policies seem a little more sensible and realistic than what we currently live with on a daily basis: &ldquo;We will send all MPs who misbehave to Rwanda&rdquo;, &ldquo;NHS…We will reduce hospital waiting lists by using a smaller font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, new for 2024 as far as I know, one of the candidates is literally - as opposed to the more typical figuratively - inhuman: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ai-steve.co.uk/">AI Steve</a>&rdquo;. As you might guess from &ldquo;his&rdquo; name, AI Steve is basically an artificial intelligence style chatbot.</p>
<p>Apparently this collection of 1s and 0s is going to be the ultimate &ldquo;by the people, for the people&rdquo; candidate. For starters, you can chat to it 24 hours a day. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-candidate-running-parliament-uk-says-ai-can-humanize-politics-rcna156991">NBC shares a screenshot</a> of the experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After that, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ai-steve.co.uk/about-us/">all inputs are summarised and outputted into HubSpot</a> so that they can be analysed and turned into policies using ChatGPT&rdquo;. Of course ChatGPT had to be involved somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Finally, it asks its potential voters - the &ldquo;Validators&rdquo; -  to score its proposed policies, with anything getting more than 50% marks becoming official policy. Absolutely no way that could ever go wrong of course.</p>
<p>Because, so far, only humans are allowed to physically sit in Parliament, a winning variant of AI Steve would in theory be represented in human form by Steve Endacott. He happens to be the chairman of <a href="https://www.neural-voice.ai/">Neural Voice</a>, a company that sells &quot; Dialogue Driven AI&quot; in the world outside of politics.</p>
<p>Despite now apparently having <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-candidate-running-parliament-uk-says-ai-can-humanize-politics-rcna156991">admirably Green leanings</a>, in 2022 he was a fully human candidate for the Conservatives. That didn&rsquo;t work out well, with him gaining just 487 votes, placing him <a href="https://www.ttgmedia.com/news/former-industry-exec-steve-endacott-becomes-ai-election-candidate-46828">in last place</a> of a 7 candidate race. But, lessons have been learned. This time, aside from having created some of the initial policy ideas, it sees like he&rsquo;s really just a proxy and will vote based on what AI Steve tells him to do. As an independent, which in some way seems unnecessary given Sunak often gives me strong vibes of being an AI deepfake himself. But sure, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be associated with the Conservatives if I was an info-swilling computer full of reassuringly definitive, and sometimes even correct, answers.</p>
<p>Apparently part of the intention was to solve the problem that many politicians have faced over the years, namely how to work effectively when you insist on living extremely far away from the constituency you are claiming to want to represent. Creatively, it turns out you just don&rsquo;t, you just get tell your constituents to talk to a machine and the machine to make all the decisions.</p>
<p>In a way it feels quite incredible that this is legal. Although I suppose it&rsquo;s a grey area. There&rsquo;s a good chance that something half-like this is already happening and the MP in question just hasn&rsquo;t mentioned that they primarily govern via commercial chatbot yet.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m relieved to see that number 1 on the list of what &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ai-steve.co.uk/">AI Steve stands for</a>&rdquo; is &ldquo;Good ideas&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Apparently I was not the only person to rather take advantage of all-you-can-eat deals, at least in my years as a student. Last month the US restaurant chain &ldquo;Red Lobster&rdquo; <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/06/14/all-you-can-eat-unlimited-deals-restaurant-chain-endless-shrimp-economics/">filed for bankruptcy</a>, in part due to losing $11 million in 3 months associated with its &ldquo;eat unlimited shrimp&rdquo; deal. That&rsquo;s 13 years after it made <a href="https://nypost.com/2003/09/26/endless-crab-pigout-is-end-for-red-lobster-boss/">basically the same mistake</a> with regards to unlimited crab. ,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/06/14/all-you-can-eat-unlimited-deals-restaurant-chain-endless-shrimp-economics/">Marketplace reports</a> that it&rsquo;s far from the only restaurant to suffer these kind of all-you-can-eat losses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All-you-can-eat deals have nearly killed a lot of restaurants, Allen said: Olive Garden lost millions on endless breadsticks; Pizza Hut lost big on its endless pizza buffet; Sizzler blamed its 1996 bankruptcy, in part, on people abusing the endless salad bar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seemingly these deals are a good way to short-term get punters into your business, but in the end restaurants don&rsquo;t often have the margins to survive the habits of the people they attract in the longer term.</p>

			 <p>In the same way that being susceptible to obesity is, at least in part, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33899337/">a biological genetic trait</a>, so, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007603">scientists found a few years ago</a>, is thinness. Researchers found several genes, over and above those known to be connected to obesity, that were associated with being thin.</p>
<p>As one of the researchers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46976031">said at the</a> time, with reference to one of society&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-perils-of-obesity-pre_b_7926576">last acceptable prejudices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This research shows for the first time that healthy thin people are generally thin because they have a lower burden of genes that increase a person&rsquo;s chances of being overweight and not because they are morally superior, as some people like to suggest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, again from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46976031">The BBC&rsquo;s reporting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;this supports the idea that, for some people, being thin has more to do with inheriting a &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; set of genes than having a perfect diet or lifestyle.</p>

			 <p>It seems there was a recent point in time where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-and-microsofts-chatbots-refuse-election-questions">neither OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT nor Google Gemini chatbots</a> appeared to be capable of giving an answer as to who won the last US presidential election.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that the robots joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon">QAnon</a>, because they also wouldn&rsquo;t reveal prior results of other countries' elections. But it&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/outreach-initiatives/supporting-the-2024-indian-general-election/">clearly deliberate</a>, further reinforcing the idea that if we&rsquo;re going down the route of a world where people increasingly rely on these robot brains to inform them about what is true about the world then the creators of these products will have a disturbingly high influence on what facts will be considered worthy enough, or &lsquo;safe&rsquo; enough, to reveal.</p>
<p>In the case of LLM chatbots and their continuing tendency to <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">make things up</a>, &lsquo;safe&rsquo; probably has to mean &lsquo;safe even if we give the wrong answer&rsquo;, which I imagine (I hope!) is why the bots were programmed to keep their mouths shut on these matters given the prevalence of now AI-ingested source content available on the internet that is&hellip;misinformed.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a new problem of course. Reference material that claims to answer questions about what&rsquo;s going on in the world has always had more than its fair share of gatekeepers.</p>
<p>In practical terms, what people learn via e.g. Google search is very highly influenced by what results Google designs their engine to return first (and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-search-getting-worse-spam-affiliate-links-duckduckgo-bing-2024-1">increasingly a mess</a>). But at least they present options, of a kind. The sort of one-stop-shop certainty and &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to look elsewhere&rdquo; authoritativeness that the chatbots have been designed to project when answering questions I think potentially might make things worse. That said, of course, even the Encyclopedia Britannica can <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=52723">hardly be said</a> to be free of bias; if nothing else then in the sense of what facts its creators deem as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica#Coverage_of_topics">worthy of inclusion</a> vs not.</p>
<p>In the past few days though it looks like ChatGPT has been altered so that it now will reveal the result - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election">Biden won</a> very definitively, in case you were unsure, even though Trump sure continues pretended he did - all 50 states, would you believe? (no).</p>
<p>Gemini still won&rsquo;t respond to those types of query though, and instead suggests you use Google Search to find the answer - which these days <a href="https://www.disinformationindex.org/research/2022-11-08-ad-funded-elections-integrity-disinformation/">I&rsquo;m not entirely sure is always the most reliable way</a> to find the truth of political matters either.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjmmrwexv4ko">The BBC found</a> a rare example of a <a href="https://reform.uk/">Reform</a> party candidate for the forthcoming UK election who doesn&rsquo;t appear to have unhealthy levels of obsessive love for Winston Churchill. Meet <a href="https://www.reformparty.uk/bexhill-and-battle-constituency">Ian Gribbin</a>.</p>
<p>The only problem is which political figures, past and present, he <em>is</em> infatuated with. As a friend noted, some of the Reform-tending folks seem to have new heroes now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Mr Gribbin posted on the Unherd website: &ldquo;Britain would be in a far better state today had we taken Hitler up on his offer of neutrality…. but oh no Britain’s warped mindset values weird notions of international morality rather than looking after its own people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a more recent point in time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the run up to the invasion of Ukraine, he praised President Putin, writing in January 2022 that he had &ldquo;shown a maturity of which we can only dream of&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whilst he&rsquo;s in love with whatever the vicious authoritarian violent dictator of the day is, he does manage to loathe at least the slight majority of the rest of the world&rsquo;s population</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Men pay 80% of tax – women spend 80% of tax revenue. On aggregate as a group you only take from society&hellip;.Less complaining please from the &lsquo;sponging gender&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>He added that women are &ldquo;subsidised by men to merely breath (sic)&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s seemingly pro-equality in some ways. But of course it&rsquo;s the darkest version of equality imaginable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Square that inequality first by depriving women of healthcare until their life expectancies are the same as men, Fair’s fair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about women who do put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way in order to defend his way of life? Umm, no, not a fan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December 2021 he wrote female soldiers &ldquo;almost made me wretch (sic)&rdquo; and were a &ldquo;total liability&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By many measures, Reform are doing incredibly well in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68079726">the polling</a>. There&rsquo;s no suggestion that most of their supporters share Gribbin&rsquo;s opinion. But it is good to know something about where the folk we&rsquo;re voting for are coming from, no matter who that is. For what it&rsquo;s worth, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the party is considering taking any action against him.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/09/the-gunning-fog.html">The Gunning fog index formula, amongst others, calculates how readable your writing is</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/09/the-gunning-fog.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-09 08:54:55 &#43;0100">Jun 9, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Gunning fog index is an algorithm that aims to indicate how readable your writing is by calculating the (roughly) the number of years of formal education you need to have had in order to understand the text after a single reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite simple, you can calculate it by hand. Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index">Wikipedia&rsquo;s description</a> it works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a continuous passage of the text of around 100 words. Don&rsquo;t include partial sentences.</li>
<li>Calculate the average number of words per sentence.</li>
<li>Count the number of &lsquo;complex&rsquo; words. Complex words are those that:
<ul>
<li>Have at least 3 syllables. Do not count common word endings like -es, -ed or -ing as syllables. For example &ldquo;created&rdquo; counts as 2 syllables.</li>
<li>Are not proper nouns, familiar jargon or compounds of simple words such as &ldquo;sunflower&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add together the average sentence length and the percentage of complex words</li>
<li>Multiply the result by 0.4.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t have to calculate it by hand. You can paste some text into <a href="http://gunning-fog-index.com/">this website</a> amongst others and it&rsquo;ll do the calculation for you.</p>
<p>It must be said that the various website options don&rsquo;t all give you the same answer, which I&rsquo;d guess reflects the slightly subjectivity needed when determining common word endings, compound words and the other exceptions to the general rule. Or of course faulty programming.</p>
<p>In summary, the formula looks like:</p>
<p><code>0.4 * ((count of words / count of sentences) + (100 × count of complex words / count of words))</code></p>
<p>As an example, the first few sentences of this post would thus be calculated as:</p>
<p><code>0.4 * ((113 / 9) + (100 * 11 / 113)) = ~ 8.9</code></p>
<p>The estimate is then that you&rsquo;d likely was 9 years of formal education to easily understand it, making you, in US terms, a high school freshman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of these things that can only ever be a rough approximation, and is presumably targeted only at the English language. But I can see it being of some use in checking whether what you write is vaguely suitable for the audience you intend it for, as well as providing some insight into what makes text readable.</p>
<p>It is only one of very many proposed formulae for calculating readability - it just happens to be the first one I came across. The <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/">Readability Formulas </a>website gives a lot more info on a lot more formulae of that type, including an opinion on <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/how-to-decide-which-readability-formula-to-use/">which to use when</a> and <a href="https://readabilityformulas.com/readability-scoring-system.php">an online calculator</a> that can calculate several at once.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/08/a-calculator-to.html">A calculator to quickly compare the energy costs of using different types of appliances</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/06/08/a-calculator-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-08 08:51:38 &#43;0100">Jun 8, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of years ago, back when British energy prices were skyrocketing to unprecedented and, for many, totally unaffordable consumer prices, I <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/11/saving-money-on.html">took some time</a> to try and understand which appliances I should try to really cut back on if I wanted to save myself from future bankruptcy</p>
<p>Catherine from <a href="https://www.gocompare.com/">gocompare.com</a>, a site that allows you to compare the prices of many types of products and services (although you probably already know that if you live in the UK - they make lots of adverts that feature <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/gocompare-advert-wynne-evans-who-19434261">officially the most irritating character</a> on television: Gio Compario),  recently wrote in to let me know about the <a href="https://www.gocompare.com/gas-and-electricity/guide/energy-calculator/">energy cost calculator</a> that they now have on their site.</p>
<p>The idea is that it lets you easily compare the approximate costs of running different devices for a given amount of time. For example, if you&rsquo;re someone who uses the oven a lot and is considering options when getting a new one, it currently reveals that using an electric oven for 2 hours a day is likely to cost you around £1.04 a day vs £0.24 for a gas oven. Which, to go on a tangent, makes it not all that surprising that some of the ever-increasing numbers of folk that depend on food banks to stand a chance of getting their next meal are having to turn down some of what&rsquo;s in theory freely available to them on the basis that <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/scottish-families-turning-down-foodbank-23401157">they can&rsquo;t afford to cook it</a>.</p>
<p>The calculator&rsquo;s values are only approximations of course. They don&rsquo;t ask you to input any information about the specific appliance models you have or the terms of any specific deal you have with your energy supplier - although they note that most people are anyway on a standard variable tariff that will usually follow the maximum allowed by any fluctuations of the government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-price-cap">energy price cap</a>. The energy consumption per device data is taken from the <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/advice/how-much-electricity-am-i-using/">Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> (which is also worth a read!) and the prices come from a <a href="https://www.britishgas.co.uk/energy/guides/average-bill.html">British Gas article</a>.</p>
<p>So, especially given there&rsquo;s not a tremendous amount of variation between most people&rsquo;s energy costs per unit these days, the calculator is certainly a useful tool to give you a quick and easy  understanding of what using your appliances is likely to cost you and, if you have options within a category, which choice is likely to cost you less.</p>
<p>Those of us concerned with the environment - which if you&rsquo;re a human <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns">you should be</a> - might also be able to use it as an indication of which types of appliances and devices are more energy efficient, and hence less polluting to use, on the basis that higher energy costs within a type of fuel obviously correlate with churning through more energy resources. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a feature that they could add in the future if enough data is available; a more explicit indication of the energy usage in each scenario you try and its typical environmental implications.</p>

He&rsquo;s treating us to the horror-show spectacle of him standing as an MP again in the upcoming general election. Pity the poor voters of Clacton. Even if this will be Farage&rsquo;s 8th attempt to become an MP, the first seven happily ending in <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nigel-farage-mp-elected-general-election-2017_uk_58f885f8e4b070a11750524e">nothing but failure</a>.</p>
<p>Last month he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-69052837">ruled out</a> standing as an MP for the weird <a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2024/01/18/reform-uk-limited-the-political-business-brought-to-you-by-billionaires/">billionaire&rsquo;s favourite</a> party <a href="https://www.reformparty.uk/">Reform</a>. This month of course he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-69082668">is actually going to stand</a> as an MP for Reform.</p>
<p>At least this will provide some rationale for the propensity of the British media insisting on featuring him on an extraordinary, unconscionable, amount of election related programming - about an election that until this announcement in theory he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/world/europe/nigel-farage-donald-trump-uk-election.html">not really involved in</a>.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that the equally fragile Trump must have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-nigel-farage-white-house-us-elections-advisor-job/">turned down</a> the idea of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nigel-farage-gets-donald-trump-job-offer-us-election-campaign/">sharing the spotlight with him</a>. So instead he&rsquo;s staying on our shores, more&rsquo;s the pity.</p>

			 <p>I recently noticed <a href="https://freegalmusic.com">Freegal</a>, a music service that does free streaming and even <a href="https://www.freegalmusic.com/faq">DRM-free downloads</a> for members of various IRL libraries.  All 100% legal.</p>
<p>It is limited to a few hours of streaming a day and a handful of track downloads a week - perhaps library dependent but it&rsquo;s 3 tracks a week for me - but it&rsquo;s hard to complain about much given it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not quite Spotify or Apple Music when it comes to track availability. For example, the only Taylor Swift you&rsquo;ll find is her entries on a few compilation albums. But they do apparently have a good few million songs to work your way through, old and new. There are definitely some reasonably mainstream 2024 albums available.</p>
<p>The couple of downloads I made so far arrived in 256 kbps MP3 format. I&rsquo;m sure the purists wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied by that, but many of us can live with it. It&rsquo;s substantially higher kbps quality than <a href="https://www.spotify.com/ve-en/premium/">Spotify&rsquo;s free plan</a> gives you, which is a mere 160 kbps.</p>
<p>I did struggle to figure out how to extract the downloaded MP3 files themselves from the iOS app without having to link my phone up to a computer. This could well be a me problem. My easy workaround for now was to use their (mobile) <a href="https://freegalmusic.com">website</a> rather than the app.</p>
<p>In general, libraries have a ton of unexpectedly wide-ranging online services for their members that don&rsquo;t require you to ever even walk through their doors beyond what&rsquo;s necessary to sign up for free in the first place. At least in the UK, I&rsquo;d assume the same is true elsewhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been various iterations of digital offerings at my local library. Right now they&rsquo;re offering free digital access to ebooks, audiobooks and magazines via <a href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby</a>. Although that content is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM locked</a> so you do have to use their app to engage with it - unless of course you live somewhere where it&rsquo;s OK to <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html">remove DRM</a> from files.</p>

<p>Apparently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/BRITAIN-EU-PARLIAMENT/0100B2J61TZ/">only one Conservative MP</a> left their party before 1992.

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781785785061">Lost in a Good Game</a> by Pete Etchells.</p>
<p>Since childhood the author, <a href="https://www.peteetchells.com/">Professor Pete Etchells</a>, has deeply enjoyed playing video games. Some now have special meaning to him. And now he&rsquo;s a Professor of Psychology and Science Communication  he&rsquo;s written a book that is an intriguing mix of tales of his personal gaming experience along with a more objective review of what the science so far tells us about the effects of gaming on humans, good or bad.</p>
<p>Gaming certainly seems to have brought him solace throughout some challenging parts of his life, which he goes into in detail. He lovingly writes about certain games; what they&rsquo;re about, how he participated, who he played with and so on. Anyone who has played many of the mega hits over the past few decades may well identify fondly with these parts. Anyone unfamiliar with, or wary of, videogaming in general might probably learn a lot about the hobby - and perhaps be surprised at the wide range and depth of the full gamut of things we call computer games. It&rsquo;s not all gem-laden Match 3 phone apps.</p>
<p>On one hand, as he mentions, there&rsquo;s a school of thought that suggests his love of gaming might make it hard for him to research the topic objectively. But the opposing school of thought, to which he belongs, argues that in fact people who are experienced gamers can do better research because they already have the necessary background to understand the nuances of content and context involved within the activity.</p>
<p>Although not always thought of this way, games are a fairly unique form of art in that we are (often) in control of them rather than passive observers. This can give us a sense of personal investment and immersion that we don&rsquo;t find in other artistic domains. Games might give us a sense of exploration, provide escapism, or connections to other people. It might vary by game, by person, and over time. All in all, they can be a very personal experience that leave us with memories of hopefully good times and on occasion maybe teach us something about ourselves.</p>
<p>We also learn a lot about the history of video games, which is longer than one might expect. The first computer that was capable of playing a game against a human was apparently &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod_(computer)">Nimrod</a>&rdquo;, which was exhibited in 1951. By the 1960-70s games were starting to move from the computer lab into arcades.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>, the first digital arcade game release, came out in 1972.</p>
<p>He then looks into why we play video games. The upshot is 1) that different people play for different reasons at different times, and 2) it&rsquo;s hard to get an unbiased view on those reasons. This uncertainty and unknowingness is a key theme to which we return to a lot when it comes to evaluating the science of gaming.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most commonly used classifications of why an individual plays games are those based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bartle">Richard Bartle&rsquo;s work</a> of 1996. Bartle observed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types">four main groups</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievers: players who aim to score points, collect treasures, level up their characters.</li>
<li>Explorers: players who like to find out more about the virtual world.</li>
<li>Socialisers: Players who aim to communicate with people who they share an interest with.</li>
<li>Killers: players who like to fight or otherwise annoy other players.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Bartle makes never claimed that these are particularly scientific. It&rsquo;s just what he picked up after talking to countless players over the years.</p>
<p>More generally regarding motivations, Etchells touches on <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-determination-theory.html">self-determination theory</a>.  That&rsquo;s an idea from psychology that suggests our behaviours are driven by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The intrinsic side of things is probably why we participate in most forms of play and sports, and hence is likely relevant to video games. Three key components of intrinsic motivation emanate from our human desires for competence, autonomy and relatedness - all of which (some) games can provide.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of confusion we need to concern ourselves about in the literature and beyond. Firstly what is the definition of a video game? Call of Duty? Candy Crush? Both? And if both, do we risk conflating too much when we talk about &ldquo;video gaming&rdquo;. Why should one produce the same effects as another? In which case, it&rsquo;s questionable how useful it is to talk about &ldquo;the effects of videogames&rdquo; as a whole.</p>
<p>Computer games are also a newish form of art. Today&rsquo;s grandparents, and possibly parents, we&rsquo;re unlikely to have grown up playing them. This leads to a very understandable fear of the unknown, exacerbated by media scare stories. I think the author sees this kind of sentiment as the latest in a historical line of &ldquo;these new things are ruining your children&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_panic">moral panics</a>.</p>
<p>We then learn about the bad scientific practices that infuse historical video games research - and indeed psychology in general. Conclusions emanating from bad science are rarely useful. This section is worth reading to learn more about what makes for good or bad science even if you have no interest in video games.</p>
<p>As well as statistical trickery, there&rsquo;s also the fundamental questions of what research questions are asked. The author believes that the vast majority of research has pursued a very limited number of questions, mainly around the harms of video games and in particular their link with violence. A study will never report any positive effects of video gaming if it is not set up to look for them. A habit of critical thinking is to be encouraged.</p>
<p>In addition to any outright fraud, there&rsquo;s a wide range of what have come to be known as <a href="https://ukrio.org/wp-content/uploads/Simon-Kolstoe-Guidance-QRPs-2023.pdf">questionable research practices </a>to consider, some of which historically are extremely prevalent in psychological research. Here we&rsquo;re talking about both individual-researcher controlled behaviours things like <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/p-hacking/">p hacking</a> as well as more structural issues such as the <a href="https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/filedrawer.html">file drawer effect</a> and so on.</p>
<p>So what does Etchells conclude as being the verdict of whether video games harm us, make us violent and so on? What mainly comes across from this book is the sad fact that we just don&rsquo;t know very much. There are certainly studies that claim to show harm. But there are other studies that claim to show no harm, or even some benefit. Many, perhaps almost all, of these studies are suspect, or at least incomplete, in one way or another. It&rsquo;s not even clear that we know how to measure something like aggression in a way that we should actually care about in terms of negative real word outcomes.</p>
<p>His take, which makes sense to me, is that the mixed messages coming out of this body of work mean that it&rsquo;s unlikely that the games studied so far have a huge effect either way on outcomes such as real-world violence. Certainly there is not nearly the ubiquitous evidence for harm you would assume there is if you read only the moral panic driven newspaper headlines on this topic. But this is of course not evidence that games can&rsquo;t cause any harm to anyone in any circumstance. The author finds it likely that some people are more prone to harm from video games than others, and some more prone to benefit - the same as almost any other such activity humans get up to in life.</p>
<p>He is particularly concerned about the more recent &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; in gaming which have, necessarily, been studied less. Examples include the added immersion caused by virtual reality and the all-too-present prevalence of what are essentially addictive gambling mechanisms - or indeed actual gambling - that infuse many of today&rsquo;s most popular games, especially on mobile devices.</p>
<p>In 2018 gaming addiction was classified as a mental health disorder by the WHO, although there is apparently much debate in academia as to whether this is a good thing or not. The author reports that there&rsquo;s certainly no agreement over how prevalent this diagnosis is or where its boundaries should lie, which are problems in themselves when it comes to making sense of or acting on such a potential problem.</p>
<p>Games usually show up on screens, so one chapter in the book deals with the perils and pleasures of screen time. Sadly the same kind of conclusions on the science show up here as we saw in the critique of gaming science. There&rsquo;s no universally accepted 100% definitive science showing that screen time is bad or good, and little in the way of reliably measuring or classifying it in the first place. Once again, perhaps not all screen time is the same or likely to have the same effect, any more than all videogames are the same.</p>
<p>He cautions us to think of screens as merely a tool. As with any tool we should learn to use them properly. We control them, not the other way around.</p>
<p>We later learn about how games can produce data that aids science, leading to more understanding about the human body and brain works. We end a chapter on e-sports, which even 6 years ago was a $900 million industry, and one on loss. That&rsquo;s loss both of the personal type but also in the sense of how we could or should preserve games themselves. This proves to be a much greater challenge than simply putting some 30 year old disk in a safe somewhere and hoping for the best. Apart from any technical issues, there&rsquo;s more to gaming and gaming culture we should want to share and remember than a series of magnetic 0s and 1s.</p>
<p>His final conclusion is not all that satisfying. But it is what we apparently have and hence should drive how we should think about the topic when we&rsquo;re making our own decisions about gaming. <a href="https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/tools/rumsfeld-matrix">Known unknowns</a> are, after all, better than unknown unknowns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are games good or bad for us? The honest answer is that we don’t convincingly know either way, and it’s probably a bit of both&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>As much as they’re a form of entertainment, they’re also a tool: one that must be treated with respect and responsibility, in the full knowledge that if used improperly or without due care and attention, they may cause as much damage as good.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/beyond-paradise">Beyond Paradise</a> season 1 and 2.</p>
<p>This is &lsquo;<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/23/watched-season-of.html">Death in Paradise</a>&rsquo;, fully UK edition. It literally has the one of the same detectives -
2017&rsquo;s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Goodman">Humphrey Goodman</a>.</p>
<p>But by now, he&rsquo;s moved from exotic tropical paradises to Devon in the south west of England in order to settle down with his girlfriend who&rsquo;s in the midst of setting up a wine bar. Of course he also somewhat accidentally manages to retain his responsibilities of bumbling around being an awkward Englishman in charge of a local police branch. Which is again situated in a small town with an incredible crime rate.</p>
<p>The weather and the accents might be different, but there&rsquo;s still a good amount of light hearted murder and other such cozy crimes to go around.</p>
<p>In comparison to the original, perhaps there&rsquo;s a bit more variety of crime going on but also, at least in the first series, a bit too much relationship drama for my taste. For the most part I prefer to watch seemingly impossible crimes get solved by improbable flashes of magical insight over some poor soul&rsquo;s marriage slowly falling apart. Didn&rsquo;t stop me finishing it though.</p>

			 <p>I felt compelled to check. Happily, it turns out that if the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/30/donald-trump-has.html">now-certified-criminal Trump</a> was to become US president once again then he could not pardon himself for the crimes he was found guilty of yesterday.</p>
<p>There seems to be some legal debate on the general topic of &ldquo;can a president pardon themselves?&rdquo;. But for these particular cases it&rsquo;s quite clear that he could not. He was being tried by a state, New York, not the federal government. That means he would need the state to agree to pardon him. Seems unlikely.</p>
<p>From the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions">Office of the Pardon Attorney</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the President have authority to grant clemency for a state conviction?</p>
<p>No. The President’s clemency power is conferred by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States, which provides: “The President . . . shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Thus, the President’s authority to grant clemency is limited to federal offenses and offenses prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia in the name of the United States in the D.C. Superior Court. An offense that violates a state law is not an offense against the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not to say he won&rsquo;t just say he magically pardoned himself anyway. And there&rsquo;s always the risk of untoward support from the worryingly activist Supreme Court justices. And as some of the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/08/17/were-up-to.html">many, many pending charges</a> against him are for federal crimes, those ones might be a lot more at risk. But it&rsquo;s not something he could (legally) do as-is with regards to yesterday&rsquo;s verdict.</p>
<p>The same applies to any US president of course. For example Biden has no power to pardon Trump of yesterday&rsquo;s crimes, even if for some bizarre reason he wanted to.</p>

			 <p>The study behind the trial that <a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=166327">Novo Nordisk stopped early</a> last year for efficacy reasons has <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2403347">been published</a> in the NEJM. And sure enough, it&rsquo;s reporting that semaglutide (aka Wegovy, Ozempic) is helpful, even life-saving, for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>To date, chronic kidney disease <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/well/ozempic-kidney-disease-semaglutide.html">has no cure</a>, whilst affecting more than 1 in 7 Americans.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01564-w">Nature&rsquo;s reporting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;those who received semaglutide injections weekly were 24% less likely to have ‘major kidney disease events’, including kidney failure and dying owing to kidney complications</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Participants who received semaglutide were also 29% less likely to die from heart attacks and other major cardiovascular incidents than were those who got a placebo, and 20% less likely to die from any cause during the trial period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/08/26/treating-obesity-can.html">not the first time</a> that this drug has been shown to save lives.</p>

			 <p>📽 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/civil-war-2024">Civil War</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Set in a presumably near-future time - I suppose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election">2025 </a>would be a reasonable guess - we see that the US has descended into another civil war. Not a figure of speech, but an actual war with armies, militias and the like.</p>
<p>A definitely-not-Trump President sits in the White House broadcasting to everyone about how he&rsquo;s about to have the greatest military victory ever seen, everyone says so. Whilst elsewhere, several well-equipped but uncoordinated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States">secession movements </a>- at least Texas, California and Florida if I remember correctly - fight what&rsquo;s left of the federal military, presumably to gain their independence and remake America into what they think it should be. Which is often a fairly unpleasant vision.</p>
<p>Anyway, we follow a team of war photo-journalists (Reuters and the NYT still exist in this world, at least to some extent) who set off to try and make it to the White House to try to photograph and interview the president for the first time in several months. Washington DC has been made basically impenetrable at this point. And traveling through the rest of a violent, impoverished, suspicious United States isn&rsquo;t an easy journey.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a whole lot of backstory. Of course if you remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">January 6th invasion of the US Capitol building</a> you might not really need one, although personally I was a little disappointed to not get to see the buildup and  transition, political and social.</p>
<p>The film does seem to take some care not to pit an army of obvious goodies against one of cartoon villains; few people come out looking all that good or virtuous. One wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily think a California secession movement would politically have a ton in common with a Texas one as it stands today.</p>
<p>In practice, it actually reminded me quite a bit of a non-zombie version of a show like Walking Dead. Very much an action film, albeit one with emotional resonance given the very well done depiction of a war torn US which, apart from being disturbing in its own right, wasn&rsquo;t a million miles away from scenes one sees from the current horrific IRL wars in Ukraine, Palestine and elsewhere.</p>

</p>
<p>A friend reports that it is indeed very good. Plus it has some personal novelty value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in a big imposing <a href="https://parkhill.estate/">block of flats in Sheffield called Park Hill</a>, which I basically lived opposite to in earlier life. It was an imposing 1960s block of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture">architecturally brutalist</a> nature. Sadly I never witnessed much in the way of singing or dancing emanating from that direction back then.</p>
<p>In fact, the flats were unfortunately a little infamous at the time. Although certainly not as bad as the area apparently was pre-skyscraper-construction in the 1930s, at which point it was spitefully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Hill,_Sheffield">known as &lsquo;Little Chicago&rsquo;</a> due to the excessive rate of violent crime.</p>
<p>Roundabouts the time I left the area the residents had mostly been dispersed. Unfortunately not all that willingly for some I understood back then, so perhaps &lsquo;evicted&rsquo; is a better term in some cases Some fancy developer was busy enacting its vision for a bright new (I assume gentrified) future for the structure, although it being a listed building they couldn&rsquo;t do too much to its overall size and shape.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I don&rsquo;t know what hallucinogens the re-designers had taken when constructing their modern day Park Hill mood board; but I <em>think</em> I remember some artists' impressions of what we were to supposedly look forward to featuring much in the way of rainbow colours and the occasional flamingo roaming throughout the grounds of their modern-day take on utopian streets in the sky.</p>

			 <p>Apple Music tempts fate / goes full engagement growth hack by <a href="https://100best.music.apple.com/us">releasing a list</a> of the top 100 &lsquo;greatest albums ever made&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To save you clicking, the top three are:</p>
<p>3: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1441164426">Abbey Road</a> by The Beatles</p>
<p>2: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/269572838">Thriller</a> by Michael Jackson</p>
<p>1: <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1276760743">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</a> by Lauryn Hill</p>
<p>Predictably, certain sections of the internet explode in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/s/ncHpjoVDlB">indignant rage</a> at the absence of their preferred artists or genres (or at its least pleasant, that the number 1 album wasn&rsquo;t recorded by a White man). Personally, I&rsquo;m finding a few gems amongst them that I haven&rsquo;t previously given a go, so it&rsquo;s certainly not all bad.</p>
<p>I believe the list was voted for by a set of people deemed to have some above average insight into the topic, using <a href="https://uproxx.com/music/how-did-apple-music-make-their-top-100-albums-of-all-time-list/">these criteria</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Albums that represented a cultural moment for the artist or genre.</li>
<li>Albums that were complete thoughts, not just collections of hit songs.</li>
<li>Albums that thoroughly represent culture in production and lyrics.</li>
<li>Albums that inspired a generation to want to create more music.</li>
<li>Albums that represent the BEST in storytelling, musicianship, recording and production.</li>
<li>Albums that are timeless and reached far beyond the genre categorization.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course taste is a personal thing. No one else&rsquo;s top 100 list is going to be yours. Not to mention that your favourites are probably not predicated on whether they &lsquo;reached far beyond the genre categorisation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Apple is far from the only company to attempt such a feat. Rolling Stone has done <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">a top 500</a> which they&rsquo;ve updated on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite fascinating to see how the &lsquo;best ever&rsquo; list changes, or doesn&rsquo;t, over time and over judging panels. The Pudding has made <a href="https://pudding.cool/2024/03/greatest-music/">a fascinating interactive visual essay about this</a>, highly recommended.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering what the background noise is around 2 minutes in, it&rsquo;s anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/22/things-can-only-get-wetter-rishi-sunak-calls-general-election-in-the-rain">masterfully broadcasting</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://song.link/gb/i/1326275073">Things Can Only Get Better</a>&rdquo;, a song which for Britons of a certain age and level of political interest is vividly connected to Labour&rsquo;s massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_United_Kingdom_general_election">1997 General Election victory</a>, as well as, let us hope and pray, being true at a surface level. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I must admit being somewhat surprised at the timing. Was he drunk? Or was it really that there was one whole week of non-catastrophic economic and migration data and, horrifyingly for the rest of us, that&rsquo;s as good as he imagines it&rsquo;s ever going to get.</p>
<p>Apparently I&rsquo;m not the only one. It seems many of his own Members of Parliament, even the big famous important ones, are a bit taken aback. There seems to be rumours, some coming <a href="https://x.com/nicholaswatt/status/1793286414651572467">via Nicholas Watt</a>,  of yet more submissions letters of no confidence about Sunak and/or lots of Tory big beasts deciding they&rsquo;re probably going to stand down rather than face the likely humiliation of trying to get elected when, despite on occasion Labour&rsquo;s best efforts to disappoint even those of us who want to find a reason to vote for them, you&rsquo;re still <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">20+pp down in the polls</a>.</p>
<p>In fact <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/full-list-tory-mps-stepping-29175685">at least 67 Tory MPs</a> have already announced their intentions to do so - mostly well before yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of the election&rsquo;s date to be clear - including Theresa May, Sajid Javid, Ben Wallace and Matt Hancock.</p>

<p>But what was such a serious conviction for such a sickening crime based on? Well, if one takes the New Yorker reporting at face value then&hellip;honestly not very much. The main piece of evidence appears to be statistical in nature - basically she was in the right place at the right time, or at least most of the places at most of the right times - and highly subject to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy">Texas sharp-shooter fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>I have no take on whether she&rsquo;s guilty or not - how could I? - but the evidence seems absurdly lacking if one takes this story at face value.</p>
<p>Although anyone in Britain will struggle to even see the story as that page of the New Yorker website <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/world/europe/new-yorker-story-murder-letby-britain.html">has been blocked</a> from being accessed by any UK users due to a court order.</p>

			 <p>Last week <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, a company who never shies away from inventing something at least adjacent to <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/10/the-torment-nexus.html">the torment nexus</a>, demonstrated their latest generative AI model: <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">GPT-4o</a>. The &ldquo;o&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;omni&rdquo;; whether this may be in the sense of omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence or omnibenevolence (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/ztm24qt/revision/3">or all 4</a>) is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>TLDR: It&rsquo;s faster, cheaper and can respond to text, audio, image, and video inputs with text, audio, and image outputs in a much more &ldquo;human&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is of course amazing and magical, as is much of the stuff that they produce. But I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s entirely wise.</p>
<p>I can see use-cases for models that can infer something about a user&rsquo;s emotions, although I would worry about even that given the emotional state of users is something that mainstream social media networks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/">actively try to exploit</a>.</p>
<p>But is it really necessary to give the model the ability to sound like <em>it</em> has emotions? When giving vocal responses it laughs, it jokes, it acts curious and interested, like it cares. Sometimes it seems excited. It flatters, it teases. But why? To obfuscate its artificialness?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that a primary goal of AI development should be to try and produce products that are increasingly indistinguishable from humans. It&rsquo;s not like the crew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise">the Starship Enterprise</a> ever seemed to complain that the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Computer_voice">ship&rsquo;s computer</a> was too unemotional. <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tomorrow_is_Yesterday_(episode)">The one time</a> it did end up programmed with an emotional-seeming &ldquo;personality&rdquo;, Captain Kirk turned it off as soon as he could.</p>
<p>Once again, perhaps there are legitimate use cases for this - other than to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">run scams</a> on a mass scale. But I suspect they are rare, should be carefully studied in advance, and aren&rsquo;t an essential component of providing most humans with the potential everyday benefits of this technology without introducing an unnecessary layer of confusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the least original observation available I know, but the OpenAI performance seems rather modelled after the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)">Her</a>. This film was in fact created after Spike Jonze read an article about a website that let you chat to an AI program - over a decade a go! Since then we have certainly seen <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/07/the-day-replika.html">people develop strong emotional attachments and possibly even love</a> for some AI models far less &ldquo;omni&rdquo; than GPT 4o.</p>
<p>I dare say that for now the OpenAI verison will have more restrictions than &ldquo;Samantha&rdquo; did - but it seems similar in mode and temperament at least.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll only be a matter of time before someone runs Theodore&rsquo;s lines from the script of Her through GPT-4o. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d be incurious about the results. Hopefully a bit more &ldquo;As an AI model I cannot&hellip;.&rdquo; will be involved.</p>
<p>Here, for the committed, is the full 26 minute announcement of what&rsquo;s new in the world of OpenAI:</p>

			 <p>The large majority of homelessness in Britain doesn&rsquo;t manifest as the stereotypical rough sleepers, but rather an increasing number of people being forced into (frequently dangerous) temporary accommodation of one sort of another - &ldquo;a peripheral and fragile existence&rdquo; to quote <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24117a03-37c2-424a-97ed-6a5292f9e92e">the Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>The FT goes on to reveal that Britain has an horrendously high rate of homelessness - &ldquo;by far the highest rate&hellip;in the developed world&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was not always this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What happened? The FT puts it down to 3 key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely inadequate rates of housebuilding.</li>
<li>An ever-diminishing social housing sector .</li>
<li>An erosion of financial support for folk who can&rsquo;t afford the market rate for rents.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all, whilst much fuss about housing benefits is often made in &ldquo;anti-welfare&rdquo; circles, last year <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/news/housing-benefits-have-been-frozen-while-rents-have-sky-rocketed-only-1-20-private-rental">the IFS determined</a> that local housing allowance has now gotten so low in comparison to rent demands that any recipient of that benefit could not possibly afford 95% of the private rental properties listed on Zoopla.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1736268193">The Tortured Poets Department</a> by Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>As has everyone else, given it has broken <a href="https://www.etonline.com/all-the-records-taylor-swifts-the-tortured-poets-department-has-broken-so-far-223853">a wide arrange of world records</a>, including being the most streamed album in one week ever, the first album to get to 300 million Spotify streams in one day,  the first to occupy the top 14 entries of the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/">Billboard Top 100 Hot Songs</a> chart and also sold the largest number of vinyl copies in a single week in modern times - 859,000.</p>
<p>The reviews seemed to me to go through phases of &ldquo;this is quite good&rdquo; to &ldquo;actually it&rsquo;s too long and repetitive&rdquo; - not helped per the release of an extended <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1742057774">31 track &ldquo;anthology&rdquo; version</a> hours after the original dropped at which point the NYT asked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/arts/music/taylor-swift-album-fatigue.html">whether we&rsquo;ve finally had too much Taylor</a>, apparently not - to &ldquo;actually there are some great moments&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s also roughly my trajectory so far.</p>
<p>It is much more in the style of her last album, <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/10/listening-to-midnights.html">Midnights</a>, than her earlier work, so if you liked that you&rsquo;ll probably like this. Very, very occasionally some of the lyrics felt just a bit like they were made by ChatGPT - but mostly I found it pretty cool and clever. And besides, any bits I didn&rsquo;t understand are probably because I am no true Swiftie; I don&rsquo;t know the lore.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-normal-music-reviews-no-longer-make-sense-for-taylor-swift">New Yorker article</a> provides perhaps the best explanation of what it means to be a Swiftie that I&rsquo;ve seen. Why in one of the tracks does TS appear to be trying to rhyme &ldquo;wife&rdquo; with &ldquo;bike&rdquo; when words that actually rhymed would make at least as much sense? Clearly she didn&rsquo;t make a mistake that no-one noticed. Rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Swift obsessives know to connect “imgonnagetyouback” with “Fallingforyou,” a song by the 1975 that was written by Swift’s ex-boyfriend Matty Healy. In it, Healy sings, “I’m so excited for the night / All we need’s my bike and your enormous house.” Swift’s mention of a bike, in “imgonnagetyouback,” is therefore an intentional creative decision, like the lack of spaces in the song’s title.</p>
<p>Some fans have gone even further, claiming that the lack of spaces not only invites a comparison to “Fallingforyou” but to Swift’s own “Blank Space,” a song on her “1989” album. (1975, 1989—there are a lot of years to keep track of here.) “In Blank Space music video, Taylor Swift is smashing things and sings ‘Cause you know I love the players And you love the game,’ ” a YouTube user called Miranda-ry9tf writes in a comment. “In imgonnagetyouback she says ‘We broke all the pieces, but you still wanna play the game.’ ” Perhaps “Blank Space,” released in 2014, was about Healy, too?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that stuff like this has led to a disconnect between your typical music reviewer and the more intense parts of her fan base.</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-dark-souls-1851439461">Kotaku</a> gives another taster of the parallel Taylorverse, linking to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y9XEJOksaYWMRbW6rox1HQuEzWwbuN3c/view?pli=1">100 page presentation</a> someone made to explain the timeline of her relationship with Matt Healy, all essential to fully interpret the album - at least for some folk. As the Washington Post wrote some time ago, there&rsquo;s a whole <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/10/20/taylor-swift-marvel-universe-eras-tour-movie/">Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe out there</a> for those with the time and inclination to indulge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We read a lot about perceptions of conflicted interests in nutrition and obesity research. Typically the focus is on financial interests.

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/pompeii-the-new-dig">Pompeii: The New Dig</a>.</p>
<p>The BBC shows us some days in the lives of an Italian archeology team as they continue the 100+ year effort to uncover what&rsquo;s under the horrific mess that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79_AD">eruption of the Mount Vesuvius volcano</a> caused to be rained down upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">city of Pompeii</a>. in the the year 79 AD.</p>
<p>Much of the city, its contents and the physical remains of the poor people who were stuck there at the time has been astonishingly well preserved by virtue of it all being covered by huge layers of ash. There&rsquo;s been various efforts to unearth it over the years - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii#Modern_archaeology">Wikipedia</a> gives the modern archaeological effort a start date in the 1920s. But the very start of the process could be a lot earlier depending on when you start counting from.</p>
<p>However, over 100 years later, a surprising-to-me amount of it is still buried under the ash, despite the complex now being a popular tourist site. So this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001yczx">new BBC documentary</a> follows a team of Italian archeologists as they excavate a whole new city block.</p>
<p>Discoveries abound; including potentially the world&rsquo;s first ever known illustration of a pizza no less. Although the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/pompeii-the-new-dig-review-not-exciting-tv-3007544">i newspaper</a> is not entirely wrong to suggest that, whilst the discoveries themselves are exciting, it is hard at times to translate that thrill to a 3 hour documentary series where most of the work involved in getting to the discoveries consists of people meticulously digging into piles of dirt. Nonetheless, the end product certainly seems to make their toil worthwhile.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to include any more find-spoilers here, but for anyone who is interested enough in the topic to want to see what was unearthed, but not interested enough to spend 3 hours watching the process and commentary, the <a href="https://www.historyextra.com/period/roman/pompeii-the-new-dig-what-we-learned/">History Extra website</a> lists some of the brightest and best finds. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001yczx">accompanying BBC site</a> also has some short highlights clips along with links to <a href="https://connect.open.ac.uk/history-and-the-arts/pompeii">a virtual tour of Pompeii</a> put together by the Open University, who were also involved in producing this documentary.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/15/between-death-and.html">Between Death and Life shares interview transcripts from people who claim to know what happens after you die</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780963277657">Between Death and Life</a> by Dolores Cannon.</p>
<p>Ever wanted to learn what happens after you die? Well, this is the book for you. Possibly.</p>
<p>The author is a hypnotherapist, specialising in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_life_regression">past life regression</a>. Past life regression is a method that some claim allows you to access memories of what happened to you in past lives whilst under hypnosis. Of course this means that the idea that we are something like souls that get reincarnated into several different human bodies over time must be taken for granted by adherents.That is of course enough to deter plenty of readers, at least if you&rsquo;re looking for a slightly more conventional, more scientific, exploration of what we know about what happens after you die.</p>
<p>But otherwise, or perhaps if you&rsquo;re just in a sort of sci-fi fantasy mood, then her claim here is that whilst conducting her therapy she started to notice that all her clients were basically telling the same, fairly fantastical at a glance, story. In particular about the nature of the time they claimed to spend between lives.</p>
<p>This observation led her to give credence to the idea that if they&rsquo;re all saying it then it must be true (of course other interpretations would be possible - just because several children reported that their parents were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_panic">involved in elaborate and sickening satanic rituals</a> whilst under hypnosis didn&rsquo;t make it true).</p>
<p>So here Cannon presents what seem to be mainly transcripts of the interviews that she conducted with her clients whilst they were hypnotised. It particularly focuses on their descriptions of the times between lives - after we on Earth would say they had died, but before they were reincarnated into a new body. The claim is that, sure, your body dies, but your spirit lives on in another dimension until such time as its ready to reincarnate into a new, usually human, body.</p>
<p>Her clients report a whole world - &ldquo;world&rdquo; is probably the wrong word - out there in a different &ldquo;higher dimension&rdquo; of temples, libraries, a computer room, a tapestry room and and a kind of soul hospital for those spirits who need to rest and recover from the experiences they had in the physical realm.</p>
<p>Whilst in her telling most animals don&rsquo;t have souls in this sense, other do entities exist; things that in the Earth-bound realm we might call elementals, aliens, demons, sprites - although plenty of times in the book the person supposedly regaling their experiences notes that they can only approximate what&rsquo;s going on in answering Cannon&rsquo;s questions as humans simply don&rsquo;t have an adequate language for it.</p>
<p>Then, when the soul is ready, unless you are one of the few who have risen so far through the hierarchy that this is no longer required, it consents to return to the physical realm as a different person on our planet; a reincarnation in the traditional sense. Typically this would be to reside within a newborn baby, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>Why would the spirit choose to return, given that human life is laborious, difficult and unpleasant at times compared to the pretty utopian experience that&rsquo;s presented as what it means to live in the higher dimensions? It&rsquo;s to learn important lessons. To redeem previous &ldquo;karma&rdquo;, a word which here is used almost entirely in a negative sense.</p>
<p>Perhaps last time you were on Earth you were a rude, abusive person. Now&rsquo;s your chance to adopt a different lifestyle based on what you learned from reviewing your bad behaviour in the spiritual realm. To make up for what you did, to fix the harms you caused.</p>
<p>A key tenet of her world view is that we all agreed to whatever happens to us in this life prior to reincarnation. With the help of advanced soul guides, a school, a library and the use of a computer we figured out what went wrong in our previous life and hence what experiences we need to have this time round in order to overcome or redeem our past ways of physical living and which other beings we&rsquo;d like to meet again in this life to help us do this. Often these will be people infused with souls you met in prior lives.</p>
<p>With all that info the various spiritual guides and extra-dimensional computers recommended our assignment to the (mostly) Earth-bound life that would most meet our needs to lead.</p>
<p>This idea of prior consent has some, to me, unpleasant implications. But it does bring a kind of comfort to some as far as I can tell insomuch as if you&rsquo;re having a tough time then it&rsquo;s something that was planned, agreed to by you beforehand and from which you&rsquo;ll gain substantial (karmic) benefit from in the long term. There&rsquo;s a reason for everything and it&rsquo;ll serve your soul in the long term. The worse the experience the more you&rsquo;ll end up benefiting from it. This got a somewhat harder to stomach for me when topics like Hitler come up.</p>
<p>In a way there&rsquo;s a semblance of some branches of Christianity here, with a kind of &ldquo;suffering is good and necessary for redemption&rdquo; and a kind of original sin type ethos. In fact figures from the major world religions - Jesus, Bhudda et al - are part of the story. These were folk that simply had very &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; souls embedded within.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much here to convince anyone of the reality of these ideas who isn&rsquo;t already a believer or advocate of some of the underlying principles. Her claims are rather wild compared to what passes for mainstream thought - and indeed much non-mainstream thought - on the matter. Those who don&rsquo;t really identify with much that falls under the modern usage of the term &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; might not get much more out of this than some potentially interesting tales. If phrases like &ldquo;astral plane&rdquo; or &ldquo;advanced souls&rdquo; grate on your nerves you&rsquo;ll surely not enjoy it. That said, the book does seem to have its fair share of true believers who find a great deal of solace in what it tells.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m slowly weaning myself away from the use of the mainstream music streaming service - <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a> et al - both due to <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">the problematic effects</a> they increasingly seem to have on the industry and the now-radical idea that I might want to permanently own my music collection.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m not there yet, and perhaps there will always be a role for them when it comes to, for instance, modern-day music discovery. Problematic or not, they do indisputably provide tremendous accessibility to a music library far beyond the ability of most individual humans to cultivate.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I wanted to reduce the fragility of my situation by replicating my library as far as possible between more than one service.</p>
<p>If, for instance, I only have my music libraries in the walled garden of <a href="https://music.apple.com/">Apple Music</a>, there&rsquo;s a (possibly paranoid) feeling that should they ever close my account, I feel compelled to close my account, some bug means they lose the details of my collection or I simply can&rsquo;t afford the subscription any more then not only can I obviously no longer listen to my hand-picked collection, I also entirely lose access to what that collection was in the first place. Which albums I added to my libraries, which tracks I liked, the algorithm that suggests new music to me, all gone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much I can do about the latter, algorithms are virtually never accessible or portable in their current instantiation. But in terms of one&rsquo;s library and playlists, it is possible to try and recreate that in another service, say Spotify.</p>
<p>This will never work perfectly as another issue with the services is they don&rsquo;t necessarily have the same music. If for instance you switch to Spotify from Apple or vice versa you may simply not have the option to listen to some of your preferred tracks, they&rsquo;re just not on the service. Such is the penalty of not owning your collection. However, realistically, if your collection is vaguely mainstream most of it probably exists in most of the big services.</p>
<p>However, these wannabe-prison services do not want you to leave, so offer no universal way to export or import a useful list of what is in your collection that I can see. Data portability is probably the last thing they want - and something I&rsquo;d love regulators to enforce one day. But for now by default it&rsquo;d be a manual effort, laboriously going through everything you care about on one service and trying to search for it on the other service, saving to library, liking, whatever.</p>
<p>This is fairly untenable, or at least very tedious, if you have anything beyond a fairly small collection. But there are third party solutions that attempt to solve this problem by automating the search-and-save operation. You would have to give them access to the accounts you wish to transfer from and to, but if you&rsquo;re comfortable with this then they can attempt to automate copying your libraries and playlists from one service to another.</p>
<p>In my case, I&rsquo;m a big listen-to-albums fan so I was most concerned in copying my library of albums across to a new service. Let&rsquo;s assume Apple Music to Spotify to take a common example. Importantly. I wanted my album library to appear as actual albums in Spotify, not as playlists containing the album&rsquo;s songs. Some people prefer the latter of course or only use playlists in the first place. There&rsquo;s no right way to do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So below is a list of services that promise to do this kind of thing that I compiled from a few searches for apps and services that can automate this transition, including what at-a-glance appeared to me as being their scope and their costs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fairly wide range of pricing and features. Most are subscription based, although if you only want to do this kind of thing once you could just buy one month. You will generally have to pay if you have anything beyond a very small library, although many have a limited free version you could test to see how well it&rsquo;s going to work for you.</p>
<p>A common feature some have is a continual sync of libraries across services. I was mainly interested just in testing a one-time operation at present but I can imagine use-cases for the latter.</p>
<p>Whilst my examples above all about Apple Music and Spotify, many of these products handle a much wider range of services so don&rsquo;t let that put you off.</p>
<p>None of these are recommendations as such as I haven&rsquo;t yet tried them. But as a starter list, here&rsquo;s some options I found, their taglines, pricing and what their homepage indicated to me is their rough feature-set, in no particular order.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787203174">Ghost Hunter</a> by Hans Holzer.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holzer">Hans Holzer</a> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapsychology">parapsychologist</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_hunting">ghost hunter</a>. As well as a prolific author, having written over 120 books on this kind of subject. Perhaps most famously, he was involved in investigating the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amityville_Horror">Amityville Horror</a>&rdquo;, which of course there are more than a few films about now. He also hosted the TV show &ldquo;Ghost Hunter&rdquo; at one point.</p>
<p>This book sees him chronicle a few of his adventures into ghost hunting. The typical set up is that he&rsquo;ll hear of some unexplained ghostly type phenomena; a person living in a home with weird noises or other more disturbing occurrences, that type of thing.  He&rsquo;ll go recruit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship">medium</a>, and off they set to visit the location in order to hold some kind of seance.</p>
<p>The medium invariably falls into a trance whilst he, via the medium, tries to communicate with whatever ghostly presence. The hope is to resolve whatever the problem is that&rsquo;s causing the spirit to feel inclined to annoy or scare the living humans around them. In general he reports being successful at this.</p>
<p>He wants us to believe he&rsquo;s doing this in a scientific way, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holzer#Reception">some of his peers were sceptical</a>. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a book that&rsquo;s going to change anyone&rsquo;s mind about whether ghosts or ghostly experiences are &ldquo;real&rdquo;. But nonetheless it&rsquo;s a fun series of somewhat spooky short stories, along with some commentary on his methods and the tremendous value he puts on mediums during such activities.</p>

<p>Most people are probably fine without specific antivirus software now <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/comprehensive-security?r=1">Windows comes with one built in</a>. But if you do feel you need one, then never a license renew before seeing if buying as a new customer is far better value. With Norton, it absolutely is, and it&rsquo;s far fro alone.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/05/09/hundreds-of-ipcc.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-10 07:35:26 &#43;0100">May 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Nearly 80% of the 380 expert scientists from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature">responded to a Guardian survey</a> reported expecting that, as in the grand scheme of things we&rsquo;ve done so little to combat global warming, temperatures are likely to rise by at least 2.5C by 2100. Which is pretty much in line with <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/12/04/the-world-is.html">last year&rsquo;s pre-Cop28 UN report</a> that had us on track for a 3 degree increase in the same time frame.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;.not good. The claim is that a 2.5 degree increase will cause &ldquo;catastrophic consequences for humanity and the planet,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the scientists envisage a “semi-dystopian” future, with famines, conflicts and mass migration, driven by heatwaves, wildfires, floods and storms of an intensity and frequency far beyond those that have already struck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lawmakers and regulators have not helped as one might have hoped they would.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerous experts said they had been left feeling hopeless, infuriated and scared by the failure of governments to act despite the clear scientific evidence provided.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But most of us, especially those in more privileged positions, likely bear at least some small responsibility for the situation. Or as on unnamed scientist said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world’s response to date is reprehensible – we live in an age of fools.</p>

			 <p>📺 (Re)watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/westworld">Westworld</a>.</p>
<p>Humans invent a theme park populated by supposedly memory-less, insensible androids; mere automatons there solely to allow the (rich) customers to live out their wild-west fantasies . Something other than hilarity ensues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d watched season one several years ago and vaguely remember it being one of the finest and most fascinating pieces of TV in a long while. Season two to be honest I don&rsquo;t remember very much from at all, not sure if that&rsquo;s their fault or mine, we&rsquo;ll see. Season 3 and 4 I haven&rsquo;t yet had the pleasure of.</p>
<p>From the very beginning though, the show does hit a bit differently in a today&rsquo;s world where <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/figure-is-putting.html">artificially intelligent drink-serving robots already exist</a>, albeit typically less clothed in artificial human skin than their Westworld equivalents are.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Out here in our world, real people are already <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/07/the-day-replika.html">falling in love with their virtual AI companions</a>. And there&rsquo;s a non-zero contingent of folk out there who suspect that even today&rsquo;s chatbots <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/06/15/im-still-struggling.html">are already sentient</a> and surely many more who are working, at least tangentially, on the issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">making them so</a>.</p>
<p>Their electronic brains certainly already <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/22/chatgpt-remembers.html">have memories</a>, so perhaps we best treat them more nicely than the show park&rsquo;s visitors treat Delores just in case.</p>
<p>Kind-of spoiler ahead: The whole weird billionaire&rsquo;s big business secretly surveilling everyone&rsquo;s data whilst you feel like you&rsquo;re being entertained is also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/opinion/facebook-privacy.html">not exclusive to the fictional world</a>, nor are the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/14/the-mother-of.html">big potentially catastrophic leaks</a> of the resulting information.</p>

			 <p>Watched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/barbie-movie-republicans-reaction">Barbie</a> (the movie).</p>
<p>Unfortunately this film was a big enough sensation that I&rsquo;d heard many of the best lines before watching it, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/04/barbies-muddled-feminist-fantasy-still-bows-to-the-patriarchy">I don&rsquo;t suppose</a> it&rsquo;s single-handedly going to cause the feminist revolution we all still sadly need. But it was very cool to see <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/barbie-movie-feminism">some of these ideas</a>  brought to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/barbie-biggest-warner-bros-movie-globally-box-office-1235575786/">truly mass market</a>](<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/barbie-biggest-warner-bros-movie-globally-box-office-1235575786/">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/barbie-biggest-warner-bros-movie-globally-box-office-1235575786/</a>) in such an enjoyable way, alongside some nods and winks to folk who already have already started the journey to enlightenment.</p>
<p>Same applies to film buffs - many shoutouts are included to iconic films of years past. The way it starts is an extremely clear parallel to <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/2001-a-space-odyssey-1968">2001: A Space Odyssey&rsquo;s</a> famous intro.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The world design was also delightful, especially (I&rsquo;d assume) if you have a history of playing with the classic doll. And somewhat educational too. I did for instance learn that there used to be a pregnant Barbie, aka Midge, for real. The <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/barbie-movie-discontinued-dolls-true-story-rcna96162">Today website</a> informs us that it came with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a detachable, magnetized pregnant belly that could fit her accompanying plastic infant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No-one wouldn&rsquo;t want to see this, so here we go, from the same Today article.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not to mention an $82 doll actually called &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_dating">Sugar Daddy</a> Ken&rsquo;. But don&rsquo;t worry, that&rsquo;s definitely not wildly inappropriate, he comes with a dog-doll that happens to be called Sugar. He&rsquo;s just <a href="https://wwd.com/pop-culture/culture-news/barbie-sugar-daddy-ken-doll-1235717734/">Sugar&rsquo;s Daddy</a>. Only someone must have forgotten the apostrophe and s when designing the box. Here he is, taken from <a href="https://wwd.com/pop-culture/culture-news/barbie-sugar-daddy-ken-doll-1235717734/">the same article</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And, at the other end of the slightly disturbing spectrum, &lsquo;Growing Up Skipper&rsquo; which was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a technological marvel of a doll that grew taller — and grew breasts — when users twisted her left arm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll need to see a video of that one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, despite being the film&rsquo;s villains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel">Mattel</a> - owners of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie">Barbie brand</a> - are probably not all that upset at the film. They estimated the film will have increased their monetary takings buy <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/heres-how-much-mattel-earn-barbie-in-2023-3496059">at least £100 million</a>  - some directly as coming from the rights to a percentage of box office revenues, other parts more due to a surge of interest in Barbie after the film release.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be all bad though. After all, the movie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/20/barbie-movie-republicans-reaction">drove a certain kind of conservative activist wild </a>when it came out - who can forget hilariously thin-skinned Ben Shapiro  <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/07/24/very-unexpectedly-something.html">burning his Barbie</a> in protest?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the trailer for the few remaining people who haven&rsquo;t seen it.</p>

			 <p>Ukraine&rsquo;s latest government spokesperson <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/05/03/ukraine-foreign-ministry-introduces-ai-generated-spokesperson/">is an AI-generated &ldquo;digital person&rdquo;</a>. A deep-fake, if you will, although it&rsquo;s not a trick - the authorities are being very transparent about what we&rsquo;re seeing. And what the spokesperson actually says is going to be 100% written by humans, as much as anything is these days anyway.</p>
<p>Known by the name &ldquo;Victoria Shi&rdquo;, the idea is that she (it?), rather than a traditional human being, will share any necessary official operational and consular information with us. Whilst not supposed to be reflective of a real person as a whole, her image <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/03/ukraine-ai-foreign-ministry-spokesperso">is (consensually) based on</a> none other than singer and former &lsquo;The Bachelor&rsquo; contestant, Rosalie Nombre.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a digital person that means that the text you hear was not read by a real person it was generated by artificial intelligence I will carry out a number of tasks first and foremost I will inform the public providing timely and verified information from Ukraine&rsquo;s Consular service I will provide journalists with updates about the work of consules in protecting the rights and interests of Ukrainian citizens abroad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supposedly this is all in the service of freeing up time and resources for real humans to do what they need to do in times of war. Something tells me people will come up with a wide range of alternative theories though.</p>
<p>The legitimate videos will each feature a QR code that link to a text version of the speech published on the official website of the <a href="https://mfa.gov.ua/en">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> in order to let you verify their integrity. Whether the inevitable future fake versions will do something similar, or whether the majority of humankind would care enough to actually check each time that each video is legit, seems less certain to me.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of her in action from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BusinessToday">Business Today</a>.</p>

<p>It seems not at all surprising that Britons would mount <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/15/council-ban-apostrophe">incandescent</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/06/council-reverses-ban-on-apostrophes">effective</a> campaigns against the desire of various authorities to remove apostrophes from their street names. An Englishman&rsquo;s home, and hence his address, is his castle and all.</p>
<p>But it did surprise me that here, in techno-AI-infused 2024, the stated rationale for doing so is because computer databases don&rsquo;t handle them well. Even though my professional life leads me to find this very plausible, it&rsquo;s still a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>I suppose grammatical error-riddled street signs would grate on me a little too, if I&rsquo;m being entirely honest.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday the UK saw a swathe of local and other miscellaneous <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2024/england/results">elections taking place</a>. It&rsquo;s one of the first occasions Britons have been to the polls en masse since the <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/no-id-no-vote-voter-id-comes-to-great-britain/">introduction of the law</a> requiring you to bring certain types of photo ID with you to the polling station in order to be allowed to vote.</p>
<p>This policy was introduced via Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Conservative government via the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/37/contents/enacted">Elections Act 2022</a>. So it was rather darkly hilarious to learn that day before the elections were to run, Conservative <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-mp-voter-id-local-elections-b2538329.html?utm_source=press.coop">MP Tom Hunt realised that he had no suitable ID</a> and hence wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to vote.</p>
<p>The reason we know about this is because someone leaked a Whatsapp message (of course!) where he was asking fellow Tory party members to help him out via being his <a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-vote/voting-by-proxy">emergency proxy</a>, a facility designed for people who lose their ID amongst other circumstances, that I&rsquo;m certain the vast majority of the UK populous doesn&rsquo;t know about. If they even know about the photo ID requirement in the first place; for such a big change I at least haven&rsquo;t seen any publicity around it recently.</p>
<p>It later came to light that <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/conservative-mp-tom-hunt-photo-id-elections-dyspraxia-b1155272.html">he suffers from a medical condition called dyspraxia</a> , which is what he attributes his overweight to. Some of the symptoms of that condition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder">include</a> &ldquo;difficulty with organisation and/or problems with attention, working memory and time management&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible and may make the more vicious commentators of a certain type tone down their output, as tempting an opportunity as it is.</p>
<p>But, as a friend noted, another thing Tom&rsquo;s situation perfectly demonstrates is why voter ID requirements tend to be bad laws that cause unjust disenfranchisement in the first place.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://theconversation.com/six-reasons-britains-impending-voter-id-law-is-a-bad-idea-196436">Toby James</a> shared six reasons why introducing the voter ID law to Britain was a bad idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no evidence of voter fraud.</li>
<li>Photographic voter ID could deny legitimate voters</li>
<li>Photo ID discriminates</li>
<li>Voter identification is expensive</li>
<li>The change is happening at too short notice</li>
<li>Other problems need fixing</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these seem more serious than others to me - but points 2 and 3 exactly describe the situation with Mr. Hunt. There&rsquo;s no question he was a legitimate voter. And had he not known about the proxy workaround, or been unable for any reason to use it, he would have been denied his right to vote.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf">research for the government</a> carried out in 2021 put the number of people who say they have no recognisable photo ID they could use was 4%. That might sound low, but as James notes it&rsquo;s equivalent to 1.9 million potential voters. And that&rsquo;s just any recognisable photo ID. The proportion of people reporting that they don&rsquo;t have any recognisable photo ID <em>that hasn&rsquo;t expired</em> is more than twice that, 9%.</p>
<p>In reality, I&rsquo;d wager that the number of people who say that they have usable, in-date, photo ID is somewhat higher than the number of people that can actually locate such a thing and remember to provide it at a polling station.</p>
<p>Furthermore, having some kind of disability puts Hunt in one of the many groups that have a higher risk of being prevented from voting than others as a result of this law.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984918/Photographic_ID_research-_headline_findings_report.pdf">same governmental research</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>12% of respondents with a severely limiting disability and eight per cent of those with a somewhat limiting difficulty said that having to present photo ID at the polling station would make voting difficult, compared with four per cent of those with no disability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of that relates to their concurrent finding that people with a disability are less likely to have appropriate photo ID in the first place. Other groups that also had lesser rates of having ID include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older people, especially those who were 85+ years old.</li>
<li>Unemployed people.</li>
<li>Those with few educational qualifications.</li>
<li>Those who haven&rsquo;t previously voted.</li>
<li>People living in certain regions of the UK, e.g. West Midlands, South West and Yorkshire and the Humber.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, it&rsquo;s perhaps of note that these are different segments of the population that those who typically work in politics or the media.</p>
<p>Younger people aged 18-29 were actually more likely to report having a photo ID than the rest of the population. Although if they were talking about their travelcards then that would be meaningless giving a strange-on-the-surface decision by the government to allow the Oyster travel card issued to 60+ year olds as valid voter ID, but not the Oyster travel card issued to 18+ year old students or the railcards issued to 16-25 year olds. There is an actual reason for this that relates to the <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/oyster-card-voter-id/">differing application processes</a> for the two types of cards which can certainly be discussed - but the survey I&rsquo;m took the above numbers from certainly didn&rsquo;t include that nuance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/campaigns/voter-id/">Electoral Reform Society</a> has similar concerns. As does the <a href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/political-mindsets/the-government-must-not-disenfranchise-low-income-voters-at-the-polls">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a> who, focusing on the economic dimension of privilege, wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there is a very real risk that the Government’s Elections Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will disenfranchise around 1.7 million voters living on a low income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And note that making available an option to get a &ldquo;free&rdquo; photo ID is no panacea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not easy, or necessarily going to be a priority, to apply to your local authority for a free Voter Card if you’re working in an insecure job with irregular, unpredictable and long hours, or juggling multiple jobs to make ends meet while also managing caring responsibilities and health needs. It’s also much harder to apply for a free Voter Card if you don’t have access to technology, or if previous interactions with your local council or job centre have created a feeling of fear and mistrust of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same article notes that other organisations such as Crisis, Operation Black Vote and The Runnymede Trust have similar concerns.</p>
<p>In any case, our voter ID law appears to be targeting a basically non-existent problem. Sure, any motivated media organisation will likely be able to find (or conjure up) a handful of individual stories of people that seemingly got away with defrauding the system. But an analysis of elections held in 2019 showed just how rare electoral fraud of the nature this law sets out to reduce seems to be.</p>
<p>As far as I can see from <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/research-reports-and-data/electoral-fraud-data/2019-electoral-fraud-data">the Electoral Commission&rsquo;s figures</a> there were a whole 2 people convicted or cautioned for using someone else&rsquo;s identity in order to vote in a way that this kind of voter ID law could potentially have perhaps prevented. Out of around <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/campaigns/voter-id/">58 million votes</a>. Which is not surprising when there are already mechanisms in place to ensure that votes are attributed to real individuals, that the same person can&rsquo;t vote twice and, let&rsquo;s face it, you&rsquo;re going to have to fake-vote a whole lot more than twice to make an meaningful impact on the result of almost any election.</p>
<p>Toby James and Alistair Clark <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01442872.2019.1694656">published an analysis</a> of a pilot voter ID initiative that was carried out during some of the 2018-2019 local elections that found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attempted impersonation was exceptionally rare, however, and measures to introduce voter identification requirements therefore had little effect on the security of the electoral process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather, the ID requirements during the pilot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;led to some voters not casting their ballot, either for reasons of convenience and availability of suitable forms of ID, or reasons of principle and protest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These laws thus seem to be setting out to solve a problem that doesn&rsquo;t really exist at meaningful scale, or less charitably, only exists in the minds of a certain type of culture-war-addled populist brain. Instead, in practice it creates a new and real problem that prevents a set of people from exercising their most fundamental fundamental democratic right. Worse yet, the disenfranchisement is likely to be biased particularly against those people who may already be struggling more than the average citizen, have a relative lack of power and privilege, and may thus be particularly affected by the constitution and nature of any elected government.</p>
<p>The real problem the UK has with people&rsquo;s voting behaviour is not that too many imaginary people vote, but rather that too few real people do. According to <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8060/CBP-8060.pdf">research from the House of Commons Library</a>, the turnout at England&rsquo;s local elections in 2021 - even before voter ID was introduced - was a pretty appalling 35.9%. Nearly two thirds of people who could have voted didn&rsquo;t vote. Perhaps we should use any available resources to focus on increasing the number of people who see fit to vote, not making it harder to do so for those who are already motivated to do so. Remove the existing barriers, don&rsquo;t add new entirely unnecessary ones.</p>
<p>Just to finish on a moment of comedy rather than despair, another person who inadvertently (?) turned up to the polling station yesterday without any suitable ID was naturally none other than our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/02/minister-sorry-as-veterans-find-id-card-not-valid-for-english-elections">former Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a>, the very person who presided over the country and the government that put these rules into place in the first place. He is, to be fair, <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/23/the-conservative-party.html">not known for his ability to adhere to rules</a>, even those he himself put in place.</p>

<p>Structured Query Language is an incredibly popular computer language used to query a huge variety of databases today. But it was described by Chamberlin and Boyce in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070926212100/http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/chamberlin/sequel-1974.pdf">a paper published in 1974</a>.</p>
<p>They may have saved us from having to query databases using its predesccor, SQUARE, which had much trickier sounding concepts of bound variables, quantifiers and first order predicate calculus.</p>
<p>TIL: the reason many people pronounce SQL as  &ldquo;sequel&rdquo; perhaps relates to the fact it was actually called SEQUEL - &ldquo;Structured English QUEry Language&rdquo; until they noticed another company had a trademark on SEQUEL. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">Wikipedia claims</a> the modern-day correct pronunciation to be simply its letters: S-Q-L.

			 <p><a href="https://kellnerpolitics.com/2024/04/23/the-brexit-effect-immigration-up-hostility-down/">Peter Kellner notes</a> what seems to be something of a paradox in the British peoples' views around immigration to the UK.</p>
<p>Since Brexit, the number of migrants coming to the UK has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/three-years-after-britain-left-eu-net-migration-never-been-higher-brexit/">rapidly increased</a> - by a lot. Which I&rsquo;m sure is annoying to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-latest-news-leave-eu-immigration-main-reason-european-union-survey-a7811651.html">a certain type of Brexiteer</a>. The media is constantly in a frenzy about the issue, the government makes ever more desperate <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/65647308">promises it won&rsquo;t keep</a> whilst simultaneously attempting <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/06/its-not-been.html">probably illegal</a> and certainly <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/03/asylum-seekers-fleeing.html">immoral strategies</a> to make it all go away.</p>
<p>But yet, even with all that, the British public&rsquo;s hostility to immigration has tended to decline over the last few years, albeit with a slight uptick last year.</p>
<p>Back in the ancient pre-Brexit-referendum era of 2015, an Ipsos poll saw <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-09/unbound-british-future-immigration-tracker-2023-charts.pdf">67% of British public</a> saying that they wanted to see a reduction in immigration. Last year&rsquo;s update showed that figure has dropped to 49%. And the percentage of people that want to see an actual increase in immigration has more than doubled from 10% to 22%.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html">Remove DRM from Amazon Kindle books with Calibre</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/04/27/remove-drm-from.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-27 09:05:22 &#43;0100">Apr 27, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> provides a popular, easy-to-use, and (sometimes) cheap ecosystem of devices and books for anyone who enjoys reading eBooks. Of course they are also not the most ethical of companies which might make the proposition entirely unattractive to you - which is not a topic I&rsquo;ll deal with here. However their monopolistic ways are such that many folk end up with a stash of Kindle ebooks they bought.</p>
<p>One problem though is that Kindle books are (usually) encrypted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a>. This means that whilst they open smoothly on Kindle devices, Kindle apps and the Kindle Reader website they won&rsquo;t work anywhere else. You can&rsquo;t switch to a different ereader device, a different app or read them on an operating system that doesn&rsquo;t have the app (except perhaps via the web).</p>
<p>Furthermore presumably if you lose access to your Amazon account then you&rsquo;ve also lost all your books. That&rsquo;s presumably unlikely to happen most of people, but there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/tpqyap/amazon_blocked_my_account_and_ive_lost_access_to/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/13ee4x5/amazon_closed_account_lost_thousands_of_ebooks/">stories</a> on the internet of people this has apparently happened to.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not absolutely unheard of for Amazon to magically make a book you thought you purchased vanish. Famously, people woke up one day to find that the copy of George Orwell&rsquo;s book &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>&rsquo; of all things - you know, the one about how the government retrospectively rewrites history by changing the digital records of what happened - <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-secretly-removes-1984-from-the-kindle-5317703">had vanished,</a> from the Amazon store and their own Kindles. They&rsquo;re also able to change the content of the books after you purchased them - <a href="https://us.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GBR7PXPE8JEJWM7U">in theory for good</a>, but each individual case might depend on your opinion. So all in all, whether you&rsquo;re switching apps or devices or simply trying to make a safe backup, you&rsquo;re going to end up with a bunch of unusable files if you try to open them in something not officially created by Amazon. I don&rsquo;t love this, to say the least.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the wonderful internet people have figured out how to remove the DRM from Amazon eBooks. Once the DRM is gone you can open it on any device or app that supports the file format, or use a tool such as <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to convert them to other formats that your chosen reading setup can work with.</p>
<p>Obviously if removing DRM is illegal where you live - and to be honest it probably is, but hey, you never know - then you shouldn&rsquo;t do it. But once you moved to a country where it is permitted then the below is - purely in theory of course - one of the simpler ways you might do it.</p>
<p>One method to do this is via the aforementioned <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre ebook management software</a> which is free, open source and available for Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems and one of its plugins. Calibre is actually well worth a look if you&rsquo;re into ebooks even if you aren&rsquo;t stuck with a load of DRM-laden Kindle files.</p>
<p>Below I&rsquo;m going to outline what I believe to have been the most reliable approach over time.</p>
<p>There are two downsides to this approach though:</p>
<p>Firstly you have to have a hardware Kindle eInk device currently registered to your Amazon account. It shouldn&rsquo;t matter which model as long as its one of the eInk ones and not one of their Android ‘Fire’ style tablets. I have heard of people buying an old and cheap ereader from eBay just to connect it up to their Amazon account to enable the below, even if they have no intention of using the device itself.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually matter if your Kindle is later broken or lost; the key is that it must currently be registered to your Amazon account.</p>
<p>Secondly you have to download your books from the Amazon website to your computer one at a time as far as I can tell. This will be painful if you have a lot of books.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s unbearable then I know some people have had success using the Kindle apps for Windows and Macs to download books en masse. But the encryption Amazon uses in that case is different than that used when you are using a Kindle eInk eReader. It seems to change often enough that depending on exactly what and when you try it you might come up against problems with the actual DRM removal.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to try that way you&rsquo;ll still need the plugin mentioned below - but also I&rsquo;d suggest you search for another guide as there&rsquo;s more to it than what I&rsquo;m outlining here. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Calibre/">Calibre subreddit</a> is perhaps one of the best places to find this stuff, but there are plenty of possibilities.</p>
<p>But if you can cope with that, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>First make sure you have <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/help">Calibre installed</a>.</li>
<li>Then download the DeDRM_tools plugin. I think the newest version is from the <a href="https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools">noDRM</a> repo;  <a href="https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/releases/tag/v10.0.9">this one</a>. Download the zip file at the bottom of the page ( DeDRM_tools_10.0.9.zip at the time of writing).</li>
<li>Extract the files from the zip somewhere onto your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then load Calibre and do the following inside it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Load plugin from file.</li>
<li>Choose to load the DeDRM_plugin.zip file you extracted from the zip above.</li>
<li>Reboot Calibre (maybe).</li>
<li>Preferences -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Plugins -&gt; DeDrm -&gt; Customize Plugin -&gt; Kindle eInk ebooks</li>
<li>Add the serial number of your Kindle, which is available either somewhere in your Kindle settings or on the Amazon website if you go to the page called &ldquo;Manage your content and devices&rdquo; and enter the devices section. Now you can see why you need an eInk Kindle to have been connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now back the Amazon website page &ldquo;Manage your content and devices&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Content and then Books and find the book you want.</li>
<li>Under &ldquo;More actions&rdquo; select to download and transfer via USB.</li>
<li>Pick the device that you added the serial number of when it asks you which devices. This will download a file, currently ending in azw3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Inside Calibre, import the azw3 book as usual via Add Books menu. And there we go, the book should hopefully open just fine in Calibre and be freely available for reading, conversion and all the other good stuff Calibre does.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another entry from the &ldquo;sort of surprised they&rsquo;re still going&rdquo; hall of fame.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/27/listening-to-saviors.html">last album I mentioned</a>, 19(!) years after this bunch were famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Predict_a_Riot">Predicting A Riot</a>, their latest album sees them taking a new and rather more calming path. Here they turn their hand to the pop-funk genre, with mere hints of their earlier style now and then.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781399623148">The Physics of Sorrow</a> by Georgi Gospodinov.</p>
<p>This is another wonderful, mind-bending, book from Georgi Gospodinov, who wrote the &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781474623025">Time Shelter</a>&rdquo;, a book <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/21/the-world-yearns.html">I greatly enjoyed</a> earlier in the year. This is somewhat peculiar story, but written in a way that feels very suited to my brain; somehow calming even in its melancholy.</p>
<p>Presumably it&rsquo;s not only my brain that it&rsquo;s suited to - it became an instant best-seller in its country of publication, Bulgaria, when it was released around 2011. So it was written much before Time Shelter, but has only been released in the UK relatively recently.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://archive.is/fBtxU">the FT notes</a>, The Economist<a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2010/12/16/the-rich-the-poor-and-bulgaria"> once referred to</a> Gospodinov&rsquo;s homeland Bulgaria as a particularly sad place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although richer countries are clearly happier, the correlation is not perfect, which suggests that other, presumably cultural, factors are at work&hellip;the saddest place in the world, relative to its income per person, is Bulgaria.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat an autobiography - the main character has the author&rsquo;s name and grows up in the country of the author. The progression through his life is clear. But it&rsquo;s also fantastical, whimsically and seriously so, as we follow his life - and those of the other minds he inhabits - over time. See, as a child, the book tells us that this Georgi suffers from &ldquo;obsessive empathetic-somatic syndrome&rdquo; which essentially allows him to get trapped in and compelled to live out other people&rsquo;s memories. When in one of these episodes, &ldquo;I&rdquo; in this case would not refer to Georgi, but rather his host, for want of a better word.</p>
<p>The story is fragmented, moving from one scene to another and back again, from his point of view to someone else&rsquo;s, obsessing for a while of some old list he found and then ruminating on what it feels like to be something else, or retelling a snippet of someone&rsquo;s life story. Time fast-forwards, time rewinds. It&rsquo;s labyrthinic, and deliberately so.  Very much like the human mind, of course.</p>
<p>Gaustine, of Time Shelter fame, gets a shoutout. References to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">Borges</a>, the author of some of my favourite short stories and similarly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinths_(short_story_collection)">a fan of narrative labyrinths</a> are made.</p>
<p>As time passes, story-book Georgi grows out of the afore-mentioned childhood syndrome, and no longer inadvertently leaps into other people&rsquo;s minds. Instead he becomes a collector of everything; every note, ticket, picture, menus, whatever - boxes of the stuff. But primarily a collector of stories. He&rsquo;ll pay for a good one.</p>
<p>One of the themes he constantly returns to is that of abandonment, and those oft-related emotions of isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>Interwoven through the experiences of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people he comes back again and again to Greek mythology, specifically the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur">the Minotaur</a>. But in this retelling the minotaur is no vicious beast. He&rsquo;s just a sad, lonely child who through no fault of his own got born with an alien face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is sorrow in him which no animal possesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor Minotaur&rsquo;s father hated him. His mother abandoned him to a dark, depressing, lonely labyrinth. At least in this novel you do get to hear the Minotaur have his day in court at one point.</p>
<p>This is the lens which much of the presumably more autobiographical elements and aspects of social commentary are shown through. The claim is made that the &ldquo;history of the world&rdquo; can be described through a series of children being abandoned.</p>

			 <p>The results aren&rsquo;t published yet, but it looks like we&rsquo;re going to see that the anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs such as Zepbound are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eli-lillys-weight-loss-drug-zepbound-found-reduce-sleep-apnea-company-rcna148113">potentially useful for treating sleep apnea</a> too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious how much of that comes from the associated weight loss - there is a known relationship between e.g. sleep apnea and obesity, albeit potentially <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/70/3/205">a fairly complicated one</a> -  vs if there&rsquo;s a more direct pathway in addition.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781119741763">Becoming a Data Head</a> by Alex J Gutman and Jordan Goldmeier.</p>
<p>This book is a nice mix of layperson and a certain amount of technical content, all on the subject of using data. It&rsquo;s primarily focused on the uses of data in the workplace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to teach you the intricacies of statistics - although it does introduce some useful concepts it&rsquo;d be helpful to understand just to navigate one&rsquo;s way through everyday life - nor how to construct cutting-edge AI models. But you probably will come away understanding more about how those things work and their limitations. As well as, probably more importantly for the  target audience of this book - business people, executives, engineers or novice/wannabe data scientists -  when and why you should consider using these kind of techniques, or, if you&rsquo;re managing people or processes, when to permit someone use them on your behalf.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thus frequently more about the mindset of data work than the technical details of it. When should you use data? What makes a project worth embarking on? When should you abandon it? And how should you react when folk present the results of their data projects to you?</p>
<p>The book is organised in to 4 sections, which give an idea of the trajectory readers will be following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking like a Data Head</li>
<li>Speaking like a Data Head</li>
<li>Understanding the Data Scientist&rsquo;s toolbox</li>
<li>Ensuring success</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one there is mostly referring to success of the data projects you or your colleagues may embark on.</p>
<p>So what then is a &ldquo;Data Head&rdquo;, that thing they want you to become?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;these are data skeptics, although the skepticism is based on employing their data critical-thinking skills rather than just to be annoying. They advocate for data where it&rsquo;s useful, but question what ought to be questioned. Their skepticism comes from having technical knowledge and domain expertise. It&rsquo;s delivered with empathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their very reasonable claim is that using data for the sake of using data is not a great use of anyone&rsquo;s resources, no matter what the hype says. Rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be an effective Data Head you must use data to drive change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And some things simply aren&rsquo;t possible no matter how much you want them to be. Let&rsquo;s never forget the famous phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Garbage in, garbage out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, according to the book, is especially the case with some of the fancier data techniques - if you are not a company with the unbelievable amounts of data, skilled personnel and other resources that say Google has, be more than a little cautious about believing that you can produce what they produce.</p>
<p>But almost certainly there are ways you and your organisation can productively use data. After all, the book proclaims that data may be the most important part of your job, whether or not you want it to be. You just need to distinguish productive avenues of inquiry from red herrings.</p>
<p>The book is impressively concise, and a pretty easy read if you have any familiarity with the topic. Along the way there are plenty of checklists and lists of good questions to ask at all phases of any data project, from conception to conclusion.</p>
<p>I can see these being useful for more knowledgeable data workers in addition to the target audience - the sort of people who already know their field well in terms of technical details, but also in some cases may risk getting carried away with their urge to spend time and money having fun with the latest and greatest algorithms on a project that never really stood a chance of working in the first place.</p>
<p>As an example, before starting on a data project the authors implore you to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this problem important? If your answer focuses on the methodology or the deliverables involved them you&rsquo;re probably missing the point of the question.</li>
<li>Who does this problem affect? Can they actually use the results you&rsquo;ll get? How will their job change?</li>
<li>What if we don&rsquo;t have the right data?</li>
<li>When is the project over?</li>
<li>What if we don&rsquo;t like the results? Meaning that the project went well, but produced an answer the stakeholders didn&rsquo;t want.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is one I have often wished more folk consider than apparently do</p>
<p>Overall, the book helps you ask better questions, both of yourself and of others. There&rsquo;s also a handy list of pitfalls later on in the book that are a good reference for checking your own work and (politely) challenging that of others.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m two years later to the party, but I believe <a href="https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Extinction_from_human_failure_to_control_AI">this</a> is the source of the famous &ldquo;AI experts believe there&rsquo;s a 10% chance that it will destroy humanity&rdquo; statistic that was the subject of a certain amount of understandable-on-the-surface media frenzy a while back (e.g. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23447596/artificial-intelligence-agi-openai-gpt3-existential-risk-human-extinction">here</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/opinion/yuval-harari-ai-chatgpt.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>The exact question asked was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What probability do you put on human inability to control future advanced AI systems causing human extinction or similarly permanent and severe disempowerment of the human species?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the median answer was 10%.</p>
<p>The responses are from some subset of 738 questionnaire responses that came from a group consisting of researchers that published something at a couple machine learning related conferences. This represents a 17% response rate from the 4271 people solicited. It sounds like this particular question was given to a smaller subset of the 738 because recipients could get  different questionnaires depending on whether they&rsquo;d already completed another assessment in the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps not unrelated, 69% of respondents think that AI safety research should be given a higher priority than it was at the time.</p>
<p>I wonder what goes through the head of someone doing work that they think stands a substantial chance of destroying everyone and everything that they love. Particularly if they&rsquo;re in a group which mostly thinks that insufficient attention is being given to safety. I&rsquo;m curious to see if there&rsquo;s any clues in the detailed data.</p>
<p>Some ideas that come to mind before actually bothering to take a look include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maybe those with high estimates actually work in AI safety, or organisations concerned with mitigating the impact of AI. Doing AI research doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re promoting AI. After all, virology researchers don&rsquo;t usually want to infect everyone with a virus. But I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s enough (prestigious) AI safety jobs to go around for that to be the case every time.</li>
<li>Perhaps they believe that the upsides of AI are so great that a 10% risk of total destruction is worth the risk.</li>
<li>Perhaps they think that they&rsquo;re more moral, careful and sensible than everyone else working in the field, and thus, given that <em>someone</em> is going to produce these systems, it&rsquo;s best that it&rsquo;s them. After all, we (nearly) all think <a href="https://80000hours.org/2012/11/do-you-think-you-re-better-than-average/">we&rsquo;re above average drivers</a>.</li>
<li>In some part similar to the above, maybe it&rsquo;s more that yes, some day there&rsquo;ll be an AI that destroys everything, but it&rsquo;s not going to be my silly little model. Maybe it&rsquo;ll be 1000 years in the future and come from an entirely different line of research. We&rsquo;re not surprised that people who build space rockets do what they do just because nuclear missiles look and work vaguely similarly.</li>
<li>Or perhaps the respondents who place high probabilities on absolute destruction don&rsquo;t actually viscerally believe that number and its implications, or at least not all the time. Maybe they never thought about the possibility until they were asked. It is possible for a person to hold two different and incompatible thoughts in one&rsquo;s head at different times or even simultaneously, particularly when one concerns your livelihood here and now and the other is a potentially distant future theoretical risk. We&rsquo;re not constantly shocked at how people from oil companies don&rsquo;t quit even though there&rsquo;s a lot more evidence that their work is directly contributing to the destruction of the planet.</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s never forget the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman&rsquo;s constant</a>. There&rsquo;s a certain amount of respondents who will say they agree with almost anything, no matter how outlandish, on any survey. Even when they either don&rsquo;t actually agree or never really thought about whether they do or not.</li>
<li>And then there&rsquo;s the fact that most humans are not really very good forecasters, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/upshot/donald-trump-leicester-city-and-why-predicting-the-future-is-so-hard.html">rare or unprecedented events</a>. Being good at making AI is a different skillset to being good at making forecasts about it. In particular we tend to be &ldquo;disproportionately swayed by improbable but extreme eventualities, such as terrorism, that come to mind easily&rdquo;, to quote <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5773401/">Lieder et al</a>, which the total destruction of everything would probably count as.</li>
<li>Because of the fact that some researchers were given different questionnaires to others it is also possible that the 69% who feel like insufficient attention is being given to AI safety are not representative of the sample who provided answers to the question resulting in that 10% chance of total destruction.</li>
<li>There is of course, as ever, the possibility that there are other methodological issues with the survey which a detailed reading might reveal.</li>

<p>One of the increasingly rare Conservative MPs with a good opinion! Wokeness runs amok!</p>
<p>Sometimes one can tell a lot about the legitimacy of a policy by the ludicrousness of the headlines it generates. This one is in reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/01/ministers-face-tory-revolt-over-plans-to-criminalise-rough-sleeping">legislation the Conservative government</a> is trying to get through that had the galaxy-brained idea of fining any rough-sleeping people - who of course famously have an excess of wealth to spare - up to £2500 for causing a nuisance. Prison sentences also available. Nuisance is defined widely enough that being &ldquo;excessively&rdquo; smelly or simply looking a bit like you might intend to sleep rough would be eligible for punishment.</p>
<p>The existing legislation - which is naturally a law from exactly 200 years ago: the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83">1824 Vagrancy Act</a> - already makes rough sleeping and begging a criminal offence. Thousands of people without homes have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/02/thousands-of-homeless-people-arrested-under-archaic-vagrancy-act">arrested for such crimes as &ldquo;vagrant being found in or upon enclosed premises&rdquo; or &ldquo;begging and wandering around&rdquo;</a> in recent years. And there&rsquo;s a concern that these changes would lead to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-tory-mps-revolt-homelessness-criminalisation-w07rwhzm6">a even greater criminalisation</a> in practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a policy so stupid and cruel that even <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-homelessness-criminalisation-b2521481.html">several of today&rsquo;s Conservative party are likely to rebel</a> if the government pushes this forward.

			 <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/04/05/ozempic-babies-weight-loss-fertility/">Anecdotal evidence is coming to light</a> that suggests that folk on the revolutionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist">GLP-1</a> anti-obesity medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy et al. are more likely to get pregnant. Sometimes this is joyfully welcomed. Other times - especially in cases where  the person concerned is taking birth control pills - it&rsquo;s more of a problematic surprise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a number of theories in play as to why this might be.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.jezebel.com/people-taking-weight-loss-drugs-are-accidentally-getting-pregnant-prescriptions-are-booming-in-states-with-abortion-bans">Jezebel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experts say it’s possible that people are getting pregnant on these drugs because weight loss can help treat insulin resistance, which can lead to more regulated ovulation and menstrual cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the medications work by slowing stomach emptying, and that can affect the absorption of oral medications when they’re taken at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drugs can also cause vomiting and diarrhea, which could mean people aren’t absorbing enough of their birth control pill to prevent pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early days yet as to how much this is a big and real phenomenon. But for it seems as because not a great deal is yet known about any effects of these drugs on pregnant humans and their offspring, if you do get pregnant whilst on these meds your doctor is likely to advise you to stop taking them. And if you don&rsquo;t want to get pregnant, you might want to avoid relying on oral contraceptives alone - something which providers should hopefully already have informed you of.</p>

			 <p>Spotify has changed its payment structure such that playing most tracks they host will result in a $0 payout to the artist. That&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ll now require a song to have at least 1000 streams a year in order to be paid out on.</p>
<p>To be clear, the claim is not that Spotify will keep the money themselves (<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">not that they&rsquo;re against that concept in general</a>), but rather it&rsquo;ll just get redistributed into payments for more popular tracks. Nonetheless, whether you think this is a good or bad move it&rsquo;s interesting to learn a bit most about the makeup of the Spotify catalogue.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/spotify-has-now-officially-demonetised-all-songs-with-less-than-1000-streams-3614010">NME</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Spotify data, there are around 100 million songs on the service, yet only around 
37.5million meet the new requirements to generate revenue.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Spotify said that 99.5 per cent of all streams on the platform “are of tracks that have above 1,000 streams.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; situation. And darkly amusing to learn that one of the non-malicious reasons they&rsquo;re doing this is that, because they anyway pay so badly, artists with those kinds of listening numbers were in practical terms not receiving any payment even under the former regime.</p>
<p>On average a song that got under 1000 streams over the past year earned a <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/modernizing-our-royalty-system">whopping $0.03 per month</a>. And not even that 3 cents made it to the place you probably thought it did given the minimum withdrawals and transaction fees that the non-Spotify institutions like to apply. And that&rsquo;s even before we consider the fact that, as <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">we covered before</a>, most money that does eventually get out of the system goes to somewhere other than the artist&rsquo;s bank account for reasons of varying legitimacy.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/10/pfas-forever-chemicals-limits-drinking-water">US imposes first-ever limits on levels of toxic PFAS in drinking water</a></p>
<p>(From The Guardian)</p>
<p>PFAS are a set of chemical compounds that have been traditionally used for making things like water, stain or heat resistant products.</p>
<p>The problem is that they have been repeatedly shown to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/20/pfas-us-drinking-water-tap">risk factors for many illnesses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chemicals are linked to cancer, birth defects, liver disease, thyroid problems, decreased immunity, hormone disruption and a range of other serious health issues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also don&rsquo;t break down naturally, so end up being dissipated all through our environment, including into our drinking water. Hundreds of millions of Americans are likely being exposed in this way.  Along with people from the rest of the world - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01402-8">a recent study</a> found places all over the world where the groundwater exceeded the recommended thresholds, even when we know the levels are likely underestimated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;this study suggests that a large fraction of surface and groundwaters globally exceed PFAS international advisories and regulations and that future PFAS environmental burden is likely underestimated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These laws don&rsquo;t cover every type of PFAS and certainly aren&rsquo;t a ban. And only a minority of the average person&rsquo;s PFAS exposure comes from water - probably <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/health/pfas-groundwater-global-contamination-scn-wellness/index.html">around 20%</a>. Other sources include the food we consume and the dust we breathe in. But, limitations acknowledged, they should improve the safety of drinking water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EPA scientists calculated that the new limits will result in thousands of fewer birth-weight related infant deaths, kidney cancer deaths, bladder cancer deaths and deaths from cardiovascular disease</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming there are least acceptable alternatives for any critical use-cases, perhaps we can also hope to see more companies <a href="https://news.3m.com/2022-12-20-3M-to-Exit-PFAS-Manufacturing-by-the-End-of-2025">following 3Ms example</a> and no longer seeing it as desirable to bother producing PFAS in the first place. Their decision to stop was at least partially due to the trend in regulations like these.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The dataset is extremely dangerous as threat actors could leverage the aggregated data for a wide range of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>Rather than newly hacked data, it seems to at least mostly be a collection of historical data breaches all handily available in one download. Which makes sense when one realises who the leaker was, outlined below.</p>
<p><a href="https://cybernews.com/security/billions-passwords-credentials-leaked-mother-of-all-breaches/">Cybernews reports</a> on some of the sites whose data was in the haul - site name and number of records:</p>

<p>They <a href="https://cybernews.com/personal-data-leak-check/">set up a site</a> where you can see if your data has been leaked which includes the above collection.</p>
<p>It seems like it was actually a site that offers the service of checking whether your personal data got leaked that was the inadvertent offender in this case. Whoops.</p>

			 <p>Started learning how to be a &lsquo;Full-Stack Developer&rsquo; with <a href="https://dev.getmimo.com/">Mimo</a>.</p>
<p>Being a <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> streak addict, as well as a not-entirely-proud owner of such fine web properties as this one (along with a heady mix of being desperate to learn things in a world where a 2 minute break is too much to ask for) it was hard to resist when a friend tipped me off that there&rsquo;s Duo equivalents but for coding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying <a href="https://mimo.org/">Mimo</a>. It&rsquo;s got basically identical types of gamification as Duo - streams, leagues, gems (well, coins) and similar 2 minute fill in the blanks and/or finish the line type exercises. The path I&rsquo;m on promises to tech me everything web from html through to backend databases. Some of which I kind of know at least substantially outdated versions of already But I learned, as many of us did back in the day, more from the View Source menu option of a browser than actual education. A further variety of languages are available to learn if this isn&rsquo;t your cup of tea - Python, SQL, Swift, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/">Sololearn</a> is a similar looking competitor if Mimo doesn&rsquo;t do it for you. They have a few extra languages on top of the above including C, C++ and Java as well as some more general fundamentals courses like &lsquo;Tech for everyone&rsquo; and a new offering on using generative AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to tell so far whether 3 minutes a day is going to make me the world&rsquo;s best web programmer or not. Mimo&rsquo;s site does proudly suggest one can &lsquo;get hired&rsquo; after working through their offerings. But given I still don&rsquo;t think I could hold a conversation in Spanish <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/08/big-duolingo-milestone.html">even after literally 1000 days</a>. I guess I&rsquo;ll see what it feels like if and when I get into topics I&rsquo;m not already sort of familiar with.</p>

			 <p>TIL that an astonishing (to me) 1 in every 21 adults in the UK is a landlord.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/19/end-of-landlords-surprisingly-simple-solution-to-uk-housing-crisis">The article I learned that from</a> has made me question my thinking a bit. Previously I&rsquo;d assumed that the broken UK housing market is essentially a problem of supply and that we should basically get over our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYism</a> and build, build, build. That still feels like it would be a good idea, and actually attracts mainstream <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61407508">political</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/08/labour-keir-starmer-new-homes-target-green-belt">support</a> these days, at least <a href="https://theweek.com/news/politics/960776/rise-of-the-nimby-party-the-tory-house-building-dilemma">to some extent</a>.</p>
<p>But apparently the statistical evidence isn&rsquo;t tremendously in favour of this being the only, or perhaps even primary, problem. The ratio homes to households has actually grown over the past 25 years. And it&rsquo;s not an especially bad ratio compared to other countries, the UK having about the average homes per capita for an OECD country, 468 per 1000 people in 2019.</p>
<p>So perhaps a large part of it is also a problem of legislation. Houses are simply getting into the hands of the wrong people. If so, then the argument goes that what we really need is some far less friendly policies when it comes to (private) landlordism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me that people&rsquo;s homes should really ever be investment vehicles. They should be high quality, decent and healthful to live in. That may not be compatible with unbridled capitalism in a country of <a href="https://equalitytrust.org.uk/scale-economic-inequality-uk">great economic inequality</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a recent paper &ldquo;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4678265">Beware of Botshit: How to manage the epistemic risks of generative chatbots</a>&rdquo; , Hannigan et al. introduce (I think) the concept of &lsquo;botshit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It relates to a particular style of use of output from one of the currently-fashionable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative AI</a> models - ChatGPT, Bard et al - and is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chatbot generated content that is not grounded in truth and is then uncritically used by a human for communication and decision-making tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And &ldquo;not grounded in truth&rdquo; is a common feature of today&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">large language models</a>, as at the end of the day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;generative chatbots are not concerned with intelligent knowing but with prediction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An obvious example of botshit in practice might be the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/16/newsguard-identifies-entire.html">hundreds of websites</a> that NewsGuard identified as having been created by generative AI and then published without care or concern by humans</p>
<p>Botshit can be distinguished from &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo;, which necessitates the same style of applying potential nonsense to a task, but in this case the content is specified as having a human origin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human-generated content that has no regard for the truth which a human then applies for communication and decision-making tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s distinguishable again from &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; which is what occurs when chatbots produce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;coherent sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because botshit requires not only that a hallucination may have occurred, but that a human actively used the results for a given task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once LLM content potentially containing a hallucination is used by a human, this application transforms it into botshit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To date I&rsquo;ve quite liked the &ldquo;<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a>&rdquo; formulation for describing generative AI nonsense output, although botshit is both catchier and makes is easy to distinguish the specific act of using AI generated ramblings for a specific task from other adjacent concepts.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/dragons-den-2005/seasons/21">season 21 of of Dragon&rsquo;s Den</a>.</p>
<p>BBC &lsquo;Business Thursday&rsquo; hit our household again this year with the Thursday back-to-back showing of both this den and the (<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/14/watching-the-apprentice.html">aforementioned</a>) Apprentice.</p>
<p>Again it&rsquo;s a program where little changes over the years. They shook things up a little with the Dragons with a couple of &lsquo;special guest&rsquo; celebrity-style judges popping in to throw some money around. And there was an episode where <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68119301">they had to overlay a health warning</a> having failed to call out that there was little medical evidence that &lsquo;ear seeds&rsquo; cured myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).</p>
<p>This was possibly less of a faux pas than the Apprentice of course, one of whose candidates<a href="https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/bbc-removes-tonights-losing-the-apprentice-contestant-from-spin-off-show-youre-fired/"> mysteriously vanished</a> from the after-show gatherings having been found to be spouting &lsquo;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13043289/Fury-vile-Apprentice-star-Dr-Asif-Munafs-foreign-bride-service.html">vile and sexist</a>&rsquo; stuff about feminism, Judaism and Hinduism.  He&rsquo;d previously set up the &ldquo;University of Masculinity&rdquo; to find Moroccan wives with the ideals he prefers for divorced Muslim men,</p>
<p>But overall, the den provided oddly reassuring old familiar stuff from an earlier era. Sure, we could lecture sternly about the ever-increasing inappropriate valorisation of business, money and personal status above the social good. But at least that&rsquo;s an old, pre <a href="https://theconversation.com/permacrisis-what-it-means-and-why-its-word-of-the-year-for-2022-194306">perma-crisis</a> problem.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-power">The Power</a>.</p>
<p>This is the TV adaptation of Naomi Alderman&rsquo;s justly-famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_(Alderman_novel)">book of the same name</a>. Or at least part of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d been so long since I read the book that I&rsquo;d forgotten everything about it except the main premise - that women everywhere start to develop the weird ability to create and transmit electricity from their bodies at a level far more than what&rsquo;s necessary to fatally electrocute people - and that I enjoyed it a great deal.</p>
<p>The key point being made here is around the implications for a world in which the average woman is no longer fundamentally threatened without recourse by physically stronger males; a world in which women by default have the upper hand when it comes to power. What would such a world look like? And, always of interest to me in this type of story, how would the transition phase go, how would those who today hope the power react to their potential dethronement?</p>
<p>Which made the start of the show a little disappointing, it being less captivating than I remembered the book as being. But as time went on either it got better or I subconsciously learned to like it. By the end I was into it enough that it&rsquo;s very obviously not-really-the-end made me hanker for a second series.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1711049681">Saviors</a> by Green Day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly amazed that bands that were big when I was young are still in one piece all these years later when some of us normies barely seem to have made it. How this bunch preserved enough energy to keep expressing their distaste for modern day America in what sounds like such physically demanding ways I&rsquo;m not sure, but they did.</p>
<p>Their distaste is indeed real. Harking back non-too-subtly to their outstanding 2004 album &ldquo;<a href="https://album.link/i/1161539183">American Idiot</a>&rdquo; - remember that was the time of George Bush, 9/11, the Iraq war and so on - they seem no more enamoured with the American lifestyle now, with first track on this album being &ldquo;The American Dream is Killing Me&rdquo;. The earlier song&rsquo;s critique of mass-media brain-numbing television culture with Bush-era &ldquo;redneck&rdquo; vibes and a kind of paranoid alienation has been updated to reflect today&rsquo;s landscape, with shoutouts to today&rsquo;s conspiracy culture, virulent homelessness, obsolescence and the continuing privatisation of everything all embedded within track 1.</p>
<p>Later on in the album we learn that &ldquo;Strange days are here to stay&rdquo;; days that include fentanyl addicted grandmothers, ubiquitous racism and a late-running Uber.</p>
<p>A real product of its time.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s rather alien to mainstream British culture, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reptile meat is not unlike chicken: high in protein, low in saturated fats, and with widespread aesthetic and culinary appeal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54874-4">new paper</a> suggests that farming snakes - pythons to be specific - is better for the environment and a more efficient use of food, water and other resources than the typical meat fare of pigs, cows  et al.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also easier to farm, especially in a world prone to climate-change related uncertainties.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to interpret the line &ldquo;They display few of the complex animal welfare issues commonly seen in caged birds and mammals&rdquo; - but perhaps they&rsquo;re also better in terms of coping with the capitalism-driven cruelty that most of our lifeforms-destined-to-be-meat undergo? They&rsquo;re also less likely to transmit zoonotic viruses along the lines of  the various bird or swine flus or, of course, Covid-19.</p>
<p>So there we go: if you are not yet willing or able to move to a plant based diet, but yet have similar concerns to many folk that have taken that step, then perhaps you could consider moving to a snake-based one as an intermediate step on that route. After all, it only feels weird to certain cultures - snake soup is for instance a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_soup">popular Cantonese delicacy</a>&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781804547793">The Bezzle</a> by Cory Doctorow.</p>
<p>This is the sequel to a book I read last year <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/07/04/finished-reading-red.html">Red Team Blues</a>. Or perhaps in part a prequal insomuch as we learn more about the life of Martin Hench, forensic accountant extraordinaire, before the crypto-infused adventures detailed in the earlier book.</p>
<p>This time he&rsquo;s up against a different variety of business-related con artists. He inadvertently gets exposed to a fairly pernicious but fixable scam whilst trying to have a good time on a rich-person&rsquo;s vacation - no surprise there - the impact of which comes back to haunt him years later. Along the way we encounter a bunch of the scams which we have all, in real life, suffered from over the past few decades.</p>
<p>As ever with Doctorow&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s highly influenced by his point of view on various political issues. Readers of <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">his excellent blog, Pluralistic</a>, will find a lot familiar here. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s meant at least somewhat as a tool to educate people outside of his blog readership of some of the issues we see with modern-day technology, high finance, out of control capitalism, weird tech-bro billionaires, all that good / terrifying stuff. You will for instance become very familiar with the dynamics of pyramid schemes. But in a good and gripping way.</p>
<p>Whilst fiction, I&rsquo;m certain much of what is described is very closely based on reality actually happened. Certainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon,_California">town of Avalon on the island of Catalina</a> is real, as is its association with Wrigley of chewing gum fame. The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/12/the-prison-industrial-complex/304669/">Prison Industrial Complex</a> is a real thing in California and beyond. The capitalists insatiable drove to profit from prisoners is real.</p>
<p>Presiding as a monopoly over prison phone calls has made big business lots of private money for years. The &ldquo;free&rdquo; tablets given to prisoners <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2019/03/07/free-tablets/">are real</a>, and equally problematic, even down to the charges made to prisoners to purchase a &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; when they send an email - although there does appear to be an in-jail <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/12/prison-tablet-jailbreaking-incarceration-connectivity.html">jailbreaking movement</a>.</p>
<p>And even though for-profit prisons (only) in California were supposedly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-us-news-gavin-newsom-ca-state-wire-prisons-11b24290ebd24798b9dc7bbf60d047c8">phased out</a> around 2020  - years after the events of the book - private prison firms have still found <a href="https://capitolweekly.net/private-prison-firms-make-big-money-in-california/">ways to make big money</a> by exploiting folk for whom in reality we have a duty of care for, not a duty to profit from at any cost.</p>
<p>The title &ldquo;Bezzle&rdquo; comes from a contraction of &ldquo;embezzlement&rdquo; and is used here as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_bezzle">John Kenneth Galbraith&rsquo;s conception</a> of the term as referring to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>A few exhibits below that caught my eye from a recent trip to the <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/">Wellcome Collection</a>&rsquo;s current exhibition &ldquo;<a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/ZJ1zCxAAACMAczPA">The Cult of Beauty</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our major new exhibition explores notions of beauty across time and cultures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the world, beauty is constantly seen as an ideal worthy of going to great lengths to achieve. But what are the driving forces that lead us to believe in a myth of universal beauty, despite its evolving nature?</p>
<p>First up, a &ldquo;Vanitas&rdquo; head. This one is a wax carving, <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/erkyjt4h/items">representing life and death</a>. In general, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/vanitas-art">Vanitas as an art genre</a> refers to artworks that are designed to symbolise &ldquo;the inevitability of death and the transience and vanity of earthly achievements and pleasures&rdquo;</p>

</a>

</p>
<p>This creepy looking thing is a &ldquo;beauty mask&rdquo;. A century ago, women might wear these to supposedly <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/mp6fhgjn/items">remove wrinkles and blemishes</a> from their face. Modern-day versions of something similar exist today, see for example the £2000 &ldquo;Cellreturn Platinum LED Mask&rdquo;. This is definitely not a personal recommendation.</p>

<p>A 2 metre+ high collage created by Eszter Magyar who runs the Instagram account &ldquo;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/makeupbrutalism/">makeupbrutalism</a>&rdquo;, called &ldquo;It makes no sense to be beautiful if no one is ugly&rdquo;. The photos are closeups of herself, covered with various types of makeup.</p>

<p>Finally for now, &ldquo;The Black Morphew&rdquo;. This is actually two photos I pasted together. The left one is what the sculpture looks like to the human eye. But if you take a photo with your flash enabled, the result is something very different; the right hand version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s named after a skin lotion made of Pelican gall bladders and wine (yum?) that was supposed to make dark scars turn silver.</p>

			 <p>Once more disregarding the warnings from future-documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, I noticed that OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt">gave ChatGPT a memory</a>. It&rsquo;ll start self-electing to remember things as you chat, so perhaps it&rsquo;s time to start acting politely and respectfully when making your demands. You can explicitly tell it to &ldquo;Remember that I love robots&rdquo; or whatever.</p>
<p>The intent is that it&rsquo;ll remember facts that will help inform what or how it communicates to you in the future. Its examples include a parent who without the help of ChatGPT would apparently have forgotten that their child likes jellyfish when designing a birthday card for her.</p>
<p>You can manage the memory to make it forget anything or everything. And there&rsquo;s a kind of incognito-mode <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq">&ldquo;temporary chat&rdquo; feature</a> where no history or memories are kept, nor is data used for future training.</p>
<p>Otherwise though, memories are used to train their future models unless you&rsquo;ve a paid teams or enterprise account -  so don&rsquo;t let it remember anything too confidential. And of course, like all internet connected services, no doubt one day it&rsquo;ll be hacked or otherwise leak, so there&rsquo;s another reason you might not want to overindulge in the feature.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/6">Black Mirror season 6</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I&rsquo;m not sure my nerves need shattering any further now we live in a world of <a href="https://theconversation.com/permacrisis-what-it-means-and-why-its-word-of-the-year-for-2022-194306">perma-crisis</a>, I risked watching the latest season of Black Mirror, which was first released in 2023.</p>
<p>Overall, good (bleak) times, although inevitably not quite as magnificent as some of the earlier seasons.</p>
<p>My favourite was <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/6/episodes/1">episode 1, &ldquo;Joan Is Awful&rdquo;</a>, probably because it&rsquo;s the one that seems most plausible, most contemporary, most Black-Mirror-classic &ldquo;<a href="https://the-toast.net/2015/01/20/next-black-mirror/">what if phones, but too much</a>&rdquo; with its themes of AI, deep fakes, the everyday surveillence technology we willingly carry around with us each day. privacy, unreadable terms of service, algorithmic-engagement-optimised streaming services and the like.</p>
<p>A couple of the others were a bit less phone involved, more classic horror at points. One thing I really feel like I&rsquo;ve learnt from various recent-ish day media is that if you ever discover a mysterious old VHS tape lying around then for pity&rsquo;s sake please do not try and watch it. Come on, it&rsquo;s been at least two decades since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(2002_film)">The Ring</a> taught us the perils of that path.</p>

			 <p>Here comes yet another example of <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/23/the-conservative-party.html">conservatives hating law and order</a>, at least those laws that seek to do anything other than <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html">protect their in-group</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gbnews.com/">GB News</a> - a horror show of a TV channel that was Britain&rsquo;s thankfully lackluster <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-opinion-gb-news-is-brexit-britain-ready-fox-news/">take on Fox News</a> which an unholy number of our serving government are nonetheless much too fond of - continues to get in trouble with the regulators.</p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re curious about what kind of shows you&rsquo;re almost certainly missing given that at times it&rsquo;s been so unpopular with viewers that some of its broadcasts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/15/gb-news-shows-attracted-zero-viewers-after-boycott-over-taking-the-knee">attracted literally zero viewers</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Johnson, who was<a href="https://www.cityam.com/boris-johnson-excited-to-join-ranks-of-nigel-farage-on-gb-news/"> tapped to join</a> GB News radio in December, is a presenter, programme maker and commentator. Farage presents a daily primetime show on the channel, while Rees Mogg hosts a State of the Nation programme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several advertisers also <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/gb-news-advertisers/">dropped out of the channel</a> as soon as two days after the channel launched and they saw what kind of dross their products were being shoved in between. In a fit of pique, thin-skinned chairman-at-the-time Andrew Neil threw his toys out of the pram and decided he&rsquo;s going to ban the brands who withdrew their adverts from advertising. I&rsquo;m sure they were devastated at this classic &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t quit, I&rsquo;m firing you!&rdquo; tantrum.</p>
<p>So the channel does little but <a href="https://www.cityam.com/gb-news-losses-widen-to-42m-amid-farage-rees-mogg-johnson-wages-and-ofcom-probes/">lose vast amounts</a> of its investors' money, which is probably its main contribution towards a fair and just society. Although a fair whack of said cash unfortunately goes towards six-figure salaries for the likes of Lee Anderson, the ex-Conservative deputy Chairman who managed to say so many stupid and offensive things during his £100k side-job that even today&rsquo;s Conservative party saw fit to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68392621">withdraw the whip</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the big names mentioned above provide a clue as to their latest infraction of regulations. The regulator <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/">Ofcom</a> recently censured the channel <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2024/politicians-acting-as-news-presenters-on-gb-news-broke-broadcasting-rules">for breaking British rules on news impartiality</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv-radio-and-on-demand/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code">Broadcasting Code</a>, news, in whatever form, must be presented with due impartiality. Additionally, a politician cannot be a newsreader, news interviewer or news reporter unless, exceptionally, there is editorial justification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dodgy biased news from people that should know better (not to mention be focusing on their primary jobs) is only one way in which GB News fails to respect GB rules.  Just a couple of weeks ago Ofcom ruled that the channel had <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2024/misogynistic-comments-on-dan-wootton-tonight-broke-offence-rules">broadcast misogynistic comments</a> made by the inane presenter(?) Lawrence Fox unchallenged and uncontextualised. The comments had generated almost 9000 complaints.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that Mr Fox’s comments constituted a highly personal attack on Ms Evans and were potentially highly offensive to viewers. They reduced her contribution to a broadcast discussion on mental health - in her professional capacity as a political journalist - to a judgment on whether she, or women like her who publicly expressed their political opinions, were sexually desirable to men.</p>
<p>As such, we considered that Mr Fox’s comments were degrading and demeaning both to Ms Evans and women generally and were clearly and unambiguously misogynistic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of 2023 it was noted that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67396474">Ofcom had 14 open investigations</a> into the channel. So to be honest you could just scroll through <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre?">Ofcom&rsquo;s news page</a> to get a good idea of how often this particular channel likes to break the rules so overtly that the regulators get involved.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781035409891">The Abuse of Power</a> by Theresa May.</p>
<p>It may, astonishingly, be four Prime Ministers ago,  but British folk might still vaguely remember the tenure of PM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May">Theresa May</a>. If not, maybe such trigger-words as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_invocation_of_Article_50_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union">Article 50</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_hostile_environment_policy">Hostile Environment</a>&rdquo; will bring her back to memory. RIP her tenure which somehow only ended 5 years ago despite the number of, umm, &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;, we&rsquo;ve had since then.</p>
<p>Anyway, she wrote a book. Not an autobiography, or at least not a conventional one. It&rsquo;s a book about some of the various abuses of power she encountered in her political career; the events concerned, a theory of why they happened and how we can stop them happening.</p>
<p>How should we define an abuse of power? She goes with the definition of any occasion when the abusers concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;chose not to use their power in the interests of the powerless, but rather to serve themselves or to protect the institution to which they belonged</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stakes are not low. As she rightly claimed, by those in charge doing otherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;lives have been damaged and sometimes destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She provides plenty of important examples of exactly that. Seeing the chapter titles might convey some idea of what kind of abuses of power we&rsquo;re discussing, so I&rsquo;ll list them below.</p>
<p>She divides the bulk of the case studies up into three sections.</p>
<p>The first concerns inappropriate exertions within the British political sphere - &ldquo;Power and politics&rdquo;.  The chapters in this section are as follows. The ramblings after the hyphens are my additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parliamentary abuse - abuse of procedure, people, trust and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a> - no, not its existence or circumstances in which the vote took place, of course not. She&rsquo;s very much &ldquo;will of the people&rdquo; and all that bunkum. Rather the chapter more focussed on any efforts to alter its implementation from her personal vision of what would work well as being abuses, whether from the Remainer or Extreme Brexiteer side. Somewhat remarkably, her take basically seems to boil down to that anyone that disagreed with her must be putting their own interests over the national interest.</li>
<li>Social media - really as an enabler. Not doing more to remove offensive posts and vicious commentators an example of an abuse of power in her view. I can imagine many people who would find that open to debate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second batch of power abuses are considered to be topics of &ldquo;Social injustice&rdquo;. These seem more straightforwardly defined and, I hope, less debatable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster">Hillsborough</a> - the 1989 football stadium disaster where people died as a result of being crushed in a crowd.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primodos">Primodos</a> - a hormone based pregnancy test from the 1960s-70s that turned out to be associated with later severe birth defects.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire">Grenfell</a> - the 2017 fire that broke out a block of flats that led substantially more than 100 deaths and injuries.</li>
<li>Child sexual abuse</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal">Rotherham</a> - by which she means more of the previous topic, but this time the specific cases that took place at the hands of &ldquo;grooming gangs&rdquo; in  Rotherham from the 1980s up to the 2010s</li>
<li>Stop and Search - as carried out by the British police.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Daniel_Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> - the investigation into the murder of a private investigator of that name.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windrush_scandal">Windrush</a> - the starting-2018 scandal whereby immigrant British citizens from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_African-Caribbean_people#The_.22Windrush_generation.22">Windrush generation</a>, many of whom had come from Britain&rsquo;s at-the-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony">colonies</a> to mainland Britain at the invitation of the government in order to help rebuild the country after the second world war, were wrongly punished, including in some cases even being deported from the UK, supposedly because they could not provide evidence that they should be in Britain.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_21st_century">Modern Slavery</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we move back to more explicit politics - although politics are of course pervasive in all the mentioned abuses so the division might be a little artificial. But this time the geographic scope is wider - &ldquo;The International Scene&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Power on the World Stage</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal">The Salisbury Poisonings</a> - in which UK residents Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok (almost certainly?) at the hands of Russian state assassins.</li>
<li>Afghanistan - a lot of this is about the admittedly pretty catastrophic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_U.S._troop_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan">US withdrawal</a> in 2020-2021. Again though, I imagine some people would argue with the framing of it in this.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">Ukraine and Putin</a> - Putin&rsquo;s ongoing illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,  primarily the effort that started in 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all important stories that we everyone should know about. Some of them continue to dip in and out of the new cycle today. Others are far more often forgotten, but shouldn&rsquo;t be. &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana">Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it</a>&rdquo;, and so on. Although her takes on what exactly the abuse in each situation is can at times may seem a bit inconsistent. I&rsquo;m not sure that Putin invading Ukraine is really. the same type of thing as Speaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bercow">John Bercow</a> - who she appears to loathe, terming him a bully and a liar, uncharacteristically strong words - interpreting certain parliamentary polices a bit differently to how she would.</p>
<p>Ignoring that the the somewhat blatant grudge-bearing for one moment, her diagnosis very reasonably seems to be that what abuses of power have in common are that they tend to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A powerful person, group or institution who prioritises protecting themselves, defending their own existence and good reputation over the needs of those who become victims of abuse correctly and fairly. They do this &ldquo;because they can&rdquo;, an oft-repeated phrase in the book.</li>
<li>And victims who are typically  ignored, looked down upon, patronised and just generally not treated at all humanely. This of course means that poorer folk, people of colour, immigrants, and so on are over-represented on the victim side. These people with little power, resources or oftentimes respect from the nation are ripe for sacrifice on the alter of protecting the reputation and position of <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/great-and-the-good">the supposed Great and and the Good</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are good, reliable, and all-to-prevalent rules of thumb. It&rsquo;s just that, to borrow another phrase that is repeatedly used in the book, &ldquo;all too often&rdquo; I think one could say she has been in a position of responsibility for the commission of abuses herself.</p>
<p>The book goes out of its way to explicitly say something to the effect of &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t about me making excuses for what I did or trying to avoid responsibility, definitely not&rdquo; several times - I think it&rsquo;s even the first line of the back cover. But to be honest it does in part really does come across that way to me, particularly in the abuses of the political domain. Sure, there are nods at apologies for her own misdeeds or bad thought processes, but they read to me as rather lackluster or of a downplaying nature. Perhaps even the sort of thing one says when asked what their weaknesses are in a job interview: &ldquo;&hellip;I have been seen as being too careful&hellip;&rdquo; et al.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she rarely passes up an opportunity to drag Labour and other non-Conservative parties into the fray. She seems to feel a particular enmity for John Bercow. To be fair she isn&rsquo;t entirely factional; her views of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> are clearly not favourable, nor for the No-Deal Brexiteers on the right. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cummings">Dominic Cummings</a> is also correctly on the naughty list, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a> (who these days certain factions of the Conservative party <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/13/the-conservative-leadership.html">appear to be big fans of</a>).</p>
<p>But rarely does she appear to accept all that much responsibility for her own inevitable part in some of either these ad other abuses. The Windrush scandal, for instance, which most certainly <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hostile-environment-policy-theresa-may-migrants-windrush-a8315806.html">came to fore during her time in high politics</a>, she&rsquo;s at pains to point out that it could have, should have, been solved by all the other governments that came before her. Especially the Labour ones. After all there have been 27 different home secretaries from 1948 until she took the position. Sure, any one of them <em>could</em> have put measures in place to pre-solve the potential problem, but it wasn&rsquo;t really until her &ldquo;hostile environment&rdquo; administration that it became such a life-destroying issue. I&rsquo;m not all that amazed Clement Atlee overlooked that possible future 75+ years ago - not of course that <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/the-unwanted-the-secret-windrush-files-winston-churchill-generation-scandal-racism-296205">his contribution</a> to the absolute lack of welcome and racism some of that generation received should be overlooked.</p>
<p>I felt there was rather scant mention of the time she carefully timed an unnecessary general election - three years before the 2020 expected date - just a year after saying that she would certainly not do such a thing. Why? Well, seemingly her decision was driven by the impression that the polls showed that her party would at that moment in time win unfettered power over all government opposition - and hence <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40210957">let her get her personal vision of Brexit through</a>. That decision <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-why-not-win-majority-conservatives-hung-parliament-jeremy-corbyn-labour-ashcroft-poll-tory-party-tories-a7783101.html">backfired, badly</a>). And no mention of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-suspended-over-sex-allegations-reinstated-for-confidence-vote">her restoring the Conservative whip</a> to a couple of MPs that were under investigation for sexually inappropriate conduct essentially in order to boost the population of MPs that were guaranteed to vote in favour of her in a no-confidence vote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/review-theresa-may-abuse-power-fraser-nelson/">One review</a> notes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May’s book is not, really, about her. It’s a reflection on the failings of others and what led them to make the mistakes they did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to her solution to the abuse of power. It&rsquo;s mainly that we should recruit politicians and other people that are to be put in positions of power who are simply more dedicated to serving the public rather than reigning down megalomaniac power on them. To &ldquo;consign the abuse of power to the past&rdquo; we need to elect politicians who put &ldquo;the common good above personal interest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The solution chapter is itself called &ldquo;The Answer is Service&rdquo;. We need leaders who are motivated by serving others, not their own interests For politicians it might mean, for instance, emphasising the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2">Nolan Principles</a> - the first of which specifically refers to serving the interest of the public - during recruitment and throughout their careers. This is all good - who could disagree? - but I feel like we could do with a plan a little more specific, a little more practical,  than simply &ldquo;replace the Bad People with Good People&rdquo;. After all, the party of Boris Johnson - one of the Bad People - was elected to run country by virtue of a public vote; one with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-leads-tories-historic-general-election-win">a far more convincing result</a> than the one she takes as reflecting the wholesome, good and true &ldquo;will of the people&rdquo; (ugh) when it came to Brexit.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://archive.ph/n2nhs">less charitable commentators</a> have pointed out a slightly different take of her conclusion would be more like &ldquo;replace all the people I don&rsquo;t like with copies of me&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naturally, we must learn why the abuse of power is so rife in this country. Her diagnosis is simple. Our institutions do not have enough Theresa Mays staffing them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s fair or not, whether she&rsquo;s right or not, without some kind of undescribed systemic change I don&rsquo;t really see this as being a pragmatic or actionable solution.</p>

You can see when branches were last edited via</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some of the top British Conservatives seem to be ever more happy to embrace a low-key version of the same kind of conspiracy theories that the Trumpian QAnoners are into.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sunak seems to believe that the reason they didn&rsquo;t win <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5c0b4fdb-c93d-4182-9b6a-3d4ce930ae41">a recent byelection in Rochdale</a> was not simply because the performance of him and his party have been terrible enough in recent years that even a bunch of former Conservative voters won&rsquo;t vote for them, but rather:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rishi Sunak has said democracy is under attack from far-right and Islamist extremists as he urged the country to unite to beat the “poison”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, uniting is good, and I&rsquo;m not at all excited by the result in Rochdale. But it is possible to imagine that &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people just don&rsquo;t like the Conservatives. And it was literally impossible to vote for Labour after they had their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/world/europe/rochdale-by-election-george-galloway.html">own candidate-removing scandal</a>. Sigh.</p>
<p>This fresh after his claim that Britain is descending into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/28/sunak-demands-ban-on-protests-at-mps-homes-and-crackdown-on-mob-rule">mob rule</a>, with the implication that the mob he&rsquo;s talking about isn&rsquo;t in fact his own favoured ne&rsquo;er-do-well political colleagues.</p>
<p>Even less respectably, we have our previous Prime Minister, Liz Truss, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/21/liz-truss-deep-state-cpac-far-right">sitting down at the US CPAC conference</a> to complain that her plans were thwarted by none other than the &ldquo;deep state&rdquo;. And that the civil service is naturally being infiltrated by trans activists and environmental extremists (as if that&rsquo;d be a bad thing).</p>
<p>She apparently even likes the same kind of media as they typically do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an opinion piece published on the Fox News website, the former prime minister said agents of “the left” are active in the administrative state and “the deep state”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nigel Farage was also at CPAC of course.</p>

			 <p>I finally remembered the meme I should have used to describe the concept I was after when recently <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/07/the-day-replika.html">writing about Replika </a> of &ldquo;the tech-bro-o-sphere misunderstanding that dystopian sci-fi novels should be taken as a warning, not a product roadmap&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBlechman/status/1457842724128833538">Torment Nexus tweet</a> of course!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBlechman/">Alex Blechman</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sci-Fi Author: In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale</p>
<p>Tech Company: At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don&rsquo;t Create The Torment Nexus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now there are countless mentions of &ldquo;Torment Nexus&rdquo; across the web: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/modern-tech-is-treading-some-serious-torment-nexus-territory/">Modern tech is treading some serious Torment Nexus territory</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2022/02/18/torment_nexus">Metaverse got torment-nexused just as robot did a century before</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-author-of-ready-player-one-has-launched-his-own-tor-1851140457">The Author of Ready Player One Has Launched His Own Torment Nexus</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/squid-game-the-challenge-gameshow">And so we come to our latest Torment Nexus, the newly announced Squid Game gameshow</a>&rdquo; to pick a few high-ranking search results at random.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-torment-nexus-the-man-made-horrors-trope-explained">Know Your Meme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Torment Nexus is used as a metaphor for a thing that was once described as something that, for the benefit of humanity, should not be created, but was then actually created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original tweet was likely inspired by Meta&rsquo;s presentation of their (very grim) metaverse vision back in 2021. But there are so many other examples of the trope available to pick from. One particularly rich source is the ability to pick any episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror">Black Mirror</a> involving technology accidentally ruining lives and you&rsquo;ll likely find someone in Silicon Valley who&rsquo;s very happy and excited to be working on something similar.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year, <a href="https://blog.giovanh.com/blog/2023/03/17/replika-your-money-or-your-wife/">Gio wrote movingly</a> about the day that <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika</a> turned its AI virtual girl and boyfriends off, and what a cruelty that turned out to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an article I find myself returning to whenever I encounter folk who believe there are no real problems to be foreseen with today&rsquo;s tranche of chatbots. And also when I want an easy example of the tech-bro-o-sphere misunderstanding that dystopian sci-fi novels should be taken as a warning, not a product roadmap.</p>
<p>Firstly, I learned a new acronym. ERP is not Enterprise Resource Planning in this world, it&rsquo;s Erotic Roleplay - so intimate conversations, sexting, NSFW images, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>The kind of thing in fact that Replika explicitly advertised itself as offering via its AI chatbots. I don&rsquo;t have a Replika account to confirm with but apparently there were explicit wife and girlfriend modes, as well as friend modes. They advertised role-play, flirting, NSFW pictures from your &ldquo;AI Girlfriend&rdquo;. You could even (virtually) marry your AI companion.</p>
<p>Replika advertised itself as being a service for this. They encouraged users to chat regularly, to emotionally and psychologically invest in this digital friend who, unlike ChatGPT et al, was specifically designed give the impression of caring about you.</p>
<p>From one of their adverts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you feel like you have no one to talk to - meet the world&rsquo;s first AI friend. Replika is here to chat about anything, anytime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So whatever your feelings are about whether these services are healthy, useful, and should exist or not, the point is that it did exist. It was allowed. It was promoted. It was promised. They tried to convince you.</p>
<p>Back to Gio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having this emotional investment wasn’t off-label use, it was literally the core service offering. You invested your time and money, and the app would meet your emotional needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  turns out that ERP modes, sexual or otherwise, appealed to a lot of its customers. It&rsquo;s perhaps not surprising that in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern">the current epidemic of loneliness</a> people turned to them, for better or worse.  And then one day Replika just turned off those abilities, or as Gio terms it, lobotomised them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a potential financial bait and switch in this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very, very clearly the case that people were sold this ERP functionality and paid for a year in January only to have the core offering gutted in February.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But also a psychological and emotional one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People just had their girlfriends killed off by policy. Things got real bad. The Replika community exploded in rage and disappointment, and for weeks the pinned post on the Replika subreddit was a collection of mental health resources including a suicide hotline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suddenly your AI wife simply couldn&rsquo;t express love for you. Some of the testimonials from users that Gio features are quite heart-breaking, even if you don&rsquo;t think this service should ever have existed in the first place.</p>
<p>For anyone that thinks that having an AI partner is icky, is funny, is to be laughed at, remember that whether or not this service is ethical or should exist - I tend to think it should not, although I don&rsquo;t know the research on this topic -  it did exist. It was promoted, it told vulnerable, lonely people (but not only vulnerable and lonely people) that it would help them lead a happier life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to mock the customers who were hurt here. What kind of loser develops an emotional dependency on an erotic chatbot? First, having read accounts, it turns out the answer to that question is everyone. But this is a product that’s targeted at and specifically addresses the needs of people who are lonely and thus specifically emotionally vulnerable, which should make it worse to inflict suffering on them and endanger their mental health, not somehow funny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not all that surprised that in the current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern">epidemic of loneliness</a> some folk believed the marketing, signed up, and developed an emotional attachment, just like they were supposed to do. That was the entire selling point of the product according to some of its adverts. In any case, what matters is the negative impact that suddenly withdrawing the service without offering customers any sort of support had. An action that makes people feel upset, even suicidal, taken with apparently no care for those most vulnerable, is at least in part bad.</p>
<p>As Gio notes, probably the real user  &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; here was to trust a company would deliver what it promised. At the end of the day it was a commercial company that was providing a product. The lack of regulation that exists in this new world so far meant they were entirely free to alter or remove the product as they wished without care to its customers, subject to any existing legislation around misleading advertising and the like at least. For all the talk of safety as a rationale for this decision, the end of the day the average company only cares about its users' well-being to the extent that they it&rsquo;s a route to getting investors excited. It&rsquo;s another instantiation of Ezra Klein&rsquo;s real AI alignment problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The corporate double-speak is about how these filters are needed for safety, but they actually prove the exact opposite: you can never have a safe emotional interaction with a thing or a person that is controlled by someone else, who isn’t accountable to you and who can destroy parts of your life by simply choosing to stop providing what it’s intentionally made you dependent on.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The simple reality is nobody was “unsafe”, the company was just uncomfortable. Would “chatbot girlfriend” get them in trouble online? With regulators? Ultimately, was there money to be made by killing off the feature?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;d be quite so confident saying that nobody was made unsafe through using this product. It&rsquo;s an open question to me. I&rsquo;m aware though that some of my reticence here might be a kind of old man &ldquo;ick&rdquo; factor. Maybe these things are in fact a useful salve for people&rsquo;s lonely lives, although I&rsquo;d hate to see this kind of sticking plaster intervention take the place of a real effort to improve what made us lonely in the first place.</p>
<p>Not of course that Replika is a on a public health mission, nor would we expect it to be. I&rsquo;d like to see a lot more research into these novel technologies before the capitalists were granted unfettered access to people&rsquo;s hearts, brains and wallets. Maybe they&rsquo;re a good thing, maybe they&rsquo;re a bad thing, maybe they&rsquo;re good for some people and bad for others. But in this case certainly some users appear to have felt far worse and less safe the day after the decisions was made in comparison to the day before.</p>
<p>What Gio couldn&rsquo;t have noted in that article, because it happened more recently, was that despite <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3py9j/ai-companion-replika-erotic-roleplay-updates">statements from the founder</a> saying &ldquo;ERP is not returning&rdquo;, about a year ago naturally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-chatbot-company-replika-restores-erotic-roleplay-some-users-2023-03-25/">ERP did return to Replika</a>. At least for the users who had previously been able to access them having signed up before February 2023.  There are plenty of <a href="https://metanews.com/problems-with-replika-continue-after-erotic-roleplay-restoration/">complaints online</a> and particularly in various forums (e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/replika/">Reddit</a>) though that things aren&rsquo;t quite the same, the characters are still diminished, forgetful, and filtered from their prior state.</p>
<p>And as far as I can tell, it&rsquo;s now actually once again open to everyone who can afford the subscription. Certainly the current description in the iOS app store makes out that there are no limits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would heavily urge everyone to not count on the latter statement being even remotely true. The <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> are a far better bet for that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly against well-thought out tax plans or tax increases for those who can afford them, particularly in times of crisis. Taxes are an essential component of any public service or social safety net.</p>
<p>But the Conservatives must not be allowed to get away with pretending they&rsquo;re some kind of low tax government just because they promote any tax decreasing components of their plans whilst obfuscating the increases.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/02/the-pk-cookbook.html">The PK Cookbook argues for the benefits of a high fat, high fibre, low carb diet</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/03/02/the-pk-cookbook.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-03-02 12:43:00 &#43;0100">Mar 2, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781781611296">The PK Cookbook</a> by Sarah Myhill.</p>
<p>Yes, I actually read a cookbook. To be fair this isn&rsquo;t the sort of book you would think you were getting if you bought a cookbook. There&rsquo;s not all that many recipes in it. It&rsquo;s mainly a description of the how, what and why of Dr Myhill&rsquo;s favoured diet, the Paleo-Keto (or PK) diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Paleo, in the sense of a diet that &quot; consists of natural, unprocessed foods and rejects grains and dairy&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keto, as in a diet &ldquo;that results in the metabolic state whereby the majority of the body&rsquo;s energy is derived from ketone bodies in the blood - the state of ketosis.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s basically a high-fat, high-fibre, low-carb diet. You can get a good idea of what the book is about from her website&rsquo;s wiki, starting <a href="https://drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/The_Paleo_Ketogenic_Diet_-_this_is_a_diet_which_we_all_should_follow">here</a>.</p>
<p>An example menu for a day&rsquo;s food provided includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A breakfast of Coyo natural yoghurt, chia seeds, PK bread and some macadamia nut butter.</li>
<li>Lunch is mackerel in basil and tomato sauce, avocados and frozen berries as dessert.</li>
<li>Dinner might be tuna with tomato, cucumber, lettuce, mayonnaise and pine nuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Her claims are that, whether you&rsquo;re suffering from a chronic medical condition or are of good  health, then following this diet will benefit your health and longevity. She&rsquo;s one of those folk appears to believe a change from the typical (western) diet to her favoured one is helpful for almost any malady.</p>
<p>But in particular she claims it to be particularly helpful for people who suffer from conditions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgic_encephalomyelitis/chronic_fatigue_syndrome">ME, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</a> or aspects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID">Long Covid</a>. This includes a lot of people these days. To the best of my knowledge there are as yet few if any generally accepted, proven and effective treatments for these conditions so one can see why people would want to try even rather experimental ideas.</p>
<p>One hellish side-effect of these conditions can be that the person concerned has far too little energy to contemplate cooking up a big pot of stock and baking &ldquo;<a href="https://drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/The_Paleo_Ketogenic_Diet_-_PK_Bread">PK bread</a>&rdquo; each day which is really the platonic ideal of this diet. The author reports regularly collecting water from her local spring, harvesting her crops and slaughtering her livestock; surely opportunities not available to the majority of readers. So, to suit the rest of us and especially those suffering with extreme fatigue, the book includes handy shortcuts and an optional pre-written meal plan that&rsquo;s designed to get one through the first few weeks if you&rsquo;re in this situation.</p>
<p>This sort of low-effort onboarding is appealing to me. But what&rsquo;s less appealing to my preferences is that it&rsquo;s quite hard to fit it into a vegetarian or vegan framework, although reportedly not impossible. I don&rsquo;t think she thinks those preferences are particularly healthy for a human though.</p>
<p>She warns of an onboarding challenge though - the first few days or weeks are likely to be fairly difficult or painful as your body changes to adapt to its new conditions. As with all restrictive diets, it&rsquo;s a difficult intervention to stick to, which she acknowledges, but basically says you&rsquo;ve got to try if you want the benefits.</p>
<p>It must be noted that Dr Myhill is a controversial character. The UK&rsquo;s General Medical Council <a href="https://www.countytimes.co.uk/news/23289783.powys-doctor-suspended-promoting-unproven-covid-treatment/">banned her from practicing</a> for a while  - the most serious reasons for which <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-64457153">seem to be around the promotion of &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; treatments for Covid-19</a>, and seemingly a general skepticism regarding vaccine effectiveness and safety. These are opinions I struggle to get over. I think they are dangerous. But I suppose even if she&rsquo;s very wrong about that, it&rsquo;s possible she might be right about other stuff.</p>
<p>In any case, on the diet front, I&rsquo;m never going to be someone to tell someone who suffered from an illness that they are wrong if they believe that some intervention helped them even in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence. After all, even interventions that have been designed to have absolutely no biochemical basis for efficacy <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect">can help some people with some conditions</a>.  There are multiple people who testify to success on this diet. Absence of evidence isn&rsquo;t always the same as the evidence of absence, although the two can of course coincide.</p>
<p>Of course a different level of evidence should be required - or at least the limitations made transparent - if you&rsquo;re proselytising an intervention as a panacea for other people. That&rsquo;s a case which I&rsquo;m not convinced has been made in this book, even if there are the occasional scientific references given. This diet is counter-intuitive and prescriptive enough that I wouldn&rsquo;t feel all that comfortable embracing it whole-heartedly without the advice or monitoring from a medic, nutritionist or other knowledgeable person. It&rsquo;s also not one that everyone will find themselves able to stick with long term; a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8863186/">known issue</a> with the more traditional Keto diet.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s also a known and uncontroversial fact that dietary changes in general can greatly <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/healthy-diet">improve one&rsquo;s heath in general</a> or act as treatment for specific maladies. The Keto diet for instance has a long history of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361831/">success in the treatment of epilepsy</a> for those that find it possible to stick to. I&rsquo;m not so sure about the Paleo diet - there seems to be less conclusive research (<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/paleo-diet/">but certainly not none</a> - still, as ever, &ldquo;more research is needed&rdquo;) and occasionally a dependency on a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature">appeal to nature</a> in how people speak about it. But some of its traditional recommendations are certainly in line with the mainstream thinking around healthy diets.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008605780">Out of the Blue</a> by Harry Cole.</p>
<p>Cue the obvious jokes about that it must be the world&rsquo;s shortest book - I suppose it actually is on the shortish side for a biography of a Prime Minister to be fair. It seems that the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/blue-review-first-liz-truss-biography-reveals-warnings-ignored/">Telegraph&rsquo;s suggestion</a> that first draft of the book was submitted with the original subtitle &ldquo;The inside story of the unexpected rise of Liz Truss&rdquo; before a matter of days later it became critical <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/20/liz-truss-biographers-scrambling-to-update-book-17608143/">to add</a> &ldquo;and rapid fall&rdquo; is real. Indeed, you can still find images of the book with both titles out there.</p>
<p>It seems thorough and well-researched enough but I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a tremendous number of revelations held within it that anyone who kept somewhat on top of British political news in recent years wouldn&rsquo;t already know. Oddly, it misses out one or two bits and pieces that even very casual observers might have come across; the lack of explicit reference to <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/15/a-friend-informs.html">the Daily Star livestream of a decaying lettuce</a> being one that caught my attention (although it&rsquo;s very gently hinted at in the intro - that her &ldquo;seven days in control&rdquo; is &ldquo;&hellip;.the shelf-life of a lettuce&rdquo;).</p>
<p>But if you too want to relive the highs and lows of Britain&rsquo;s record-breaking shortest tenure Prime Minister from childhood through to political demise, then this book might satisfy you.</p>
<p>Famously she was an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in her youth. Here&rsquo;s the famous vid of her youth politicking.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Her premiership ended up being disrupted by the sad <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-ii.html">death of the Queen</a>, leading to one of the finer lines in the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within a week of the last leadership hustings at Wembley, the one-time teenage republican was kissing the hand of Queen Elizabeth II. Two days later, the beloved Monarch was dead;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let the correlation vs causation debate break forth!</p>
<p>Truss' upbringing was decidedly left-wing. Her mother even moved to try out the communist lifestyle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In spite of her upbringing as the privately educated granddaughter of a capitalist mill boss, Priscilla was clearly sympathetic to the Marxist cause. After spending time in Prague in the early 1960s, and with a babe in arms, she upped sticks to ‘try out life under the communists’ in 1977.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life under the communists didn&rsquo;t last long though, for either mother or daughter.</p>
<p>Whilst her mother retains many of her leftist ideals, Liz Truss comes across as have being as obsessionally wedded to the idea that free markets will solve all of life&rsquo;s ills from the very start, whilst taxes are the devil&rsquo;s work in all their forms. I think she&rsquo;s a true believer, to give her credit, unlike many of her purely-populist libertarian-when-it-suits peers.</p>
<p>When Truss started campaigning in the early 200s it did put her mother in a tricky situation though, a battle between the personal and the political.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it wasn’t an easy decision for Priscilla Truss, according to a former neighbour, after Liz stood again in 2005. ‘She said she was quite torn. She’d agonised over whether to support her because she was her daughter, or not to support her because she was a Tory. In the end, she decided that family ties should win out.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her father did not campaign with her.</p>
<p>Liz seemingly showed great ambition, a tireless fervor and the ability to remain committed to a cause no mater what obstacle or person gets in her way. That, for both the pursuit of her political and personal career goals. No setback was too much for her to come back from. I recall the vibes of even her resignation speech and associated interviews as somehow exuding some  &ldquo;I was right, everyone else is just too stupid to understand&rdquo; energy. Certainly her <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/09/15/liz-truss-is.html">book-promo interview</a> in <a href="https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-12499369/Liz-Truss-reveal-inside-story-49-day-premiership-new-book-including-meeting-Queen-just-hours-monarch-died.html">the Mail on Sunday</a> claimed that &ldquo;the fundamental problem was there wasn’t enough support for Conservative ideas&rdquo; - but of course it&rsquo;s the support that&rsquo;s the problem, not the ideas. Hmm.</p>
<p>This sheer amount of determination, resilience and energy to move forward is surely extremely useful for the successful pursuit of goals - it&rsquo;s just a shame her goals weren&rsquo;t something more bearable.</p>
<p>There were nonetheless some aspects of Truss that I hadn&rsquo;t fully appreciated. But those were more on her personal life and her style rather than her well-documented political accomplishments and failures. I hadn&rsquo;t understood how obsessed she was with social media, especially Instagram. Call me old but I don&rsquo;t tend to follow politicians on Insta. But she apparently put some real influencer effort in, continuously focusing on getting the perfect shot even at the expense of tremendous amounts of her team&rsquo;s time, and in some cases her actual job of attending meetings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next stop in Sydney would become a defining image of Truss’s boosterist style of promoting both Brexit Britain and herself. With the rain still pouring, it took many, many goes to get the final snap of Truss on a British-made Brompton bike with a Union flag umbrella in a car park under Sydney Harbour bridge, with the opera house looming large. Freedom of Information requests would later reveal a £1,483 freelance photographer was hired for the trip – but the picture went around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re dying to see the results, so:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>She also seems to have been something of a party animal, fueling her days with espresso and her nights with alcohol. Unlike some of her retinue she somehow appeared to be frequently able to pull off something vaguely day&rsquo;s work after a night at the clubs though. Not always though, which caused its own problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drinking began at the airport and continued on the plane … her main advisers drank two bottles of champagne on a four-hour flight. On the ground the FS [Foreign Secretary] would drink well past midnight … and be incapable of working the next day. On several trips, Truss would cancel/attempt to cancel important parts of her programme, alienating foreign representatives, due to her hangover or to restart the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly it does sound like a pretty fun lifestyle, I&rsquo;m kind of jealous. If only she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be doing something fairly important.</p>
<p>At one point during her tenure as foreign secretary, she, celebrity-like, apparently insisted on in another environment would surely be termed a rider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;orders were sent ahead to embassies around the world with details of what the Foreign Secretary would expect on a visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double espressos served in a flat white-sized takeaway cup.</li>
<li>No big-brand coffee, independent producers only, except Pret if in the UK.</li>
<li>No pre-made or plastic-packed sandwiches – nothing to be served that has not been freshly prepared.</li>
<li>Bagels or sushi for lunch – absolutely no mayonnaise on anything, ever.</li>
<li>A bottle of Sauvignon Blanc provided in the fridge of any overnight accommodation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then it all went wrong. Her focus on only the freest of free markets, libertarianism (one of her children is, of course, called Liberty) and her predilection for ignoring everything anyone else would suggest that didn&rsquo;t perfectly align with her world view led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/revealed-the-30bn-cost-of-liz-trusss-disastrous-mini-budget">a catastrophic time for Britain&rsquo;s economy</a> and a final ousting of its architect, who became <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/20/liz-truss-finally.html">Britain&rsquo;s shortest serving Prime Minister ever</a> after just 45 days in office.</p>
<p>It also introduced (to me) the harshly named economic concept of the moron premium. Per <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7bad4783-e6d1-4776-8fa7-4188bbb9d86f">the FT</a> who later went on to try and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/08908266-cc47-4cda-b8d4-97a8ac433a6d">quantify it a bit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the height of the Trussonomics experiment, the additional yield that investors were demanding on government bonds became known in financial markets as the “moron premium”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, from what we&rsquo;ve learned of her character in this book and elsewhere, it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that she&rsquo;ll retire quietly into the night.</p>

			 <p>🎙 Listening to <a href="https://pca.st/eh4j4fpr">Cyber: The End of Vice</a> podcast.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Media">Vice Media,</a> owners of such famous media properties as Vice magazine, Motherboard, Vice Sports, i-D and Refinery29 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Media#Other_business_operations">amongst others</a>, announced that it&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68377742">laying off hundreds of employees</a> last week.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/business/vice-media-layoffs.html">NYT reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cuts will be the latest in a series of severe cutbacks that the company has endured in recent years, winnowing the globe-spanning digital colossus to a husk of its former self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some folk <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/vice-media-mass-layoffs">aren&rsquo;t too happy about it</a>, with a general sense that combination of mercenary private equity investors and overly-well paid incompetant top management are, unsurprisingly, happier to cut costs at everyone else&rsquo;s expense rather than investing in the still well-regarded by many folk company. This to the extent of apparently making the bizarre decision that famed web publishing company Vice <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/vice-cease-publishing-layoff-hundreds-ceo-1235919843/">will not have a website</a> in the future - no more <a href="https://www.vice.com/">vice.com</a>, rather a pivot to what feels like a spectacularly ill-timed &ldquo;emphasis on social channels&rdquo; .</p>
<p>So a bunch of Vice reporters woke up to discover they no longer had access to Vice&rsquo;s article publishing system. But someone forgot to take away their access to the podcast distribution feed  and so <a href="https://pca.st/eh4j4fpr">here we are</a>, with what will presumably be the last ever episode of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber">Cyber podcast</a>, in which the now ex-employees Matthew, Emily, Anna Merlan, Tim Marchman and Mack Lamoureux going rogue and dropping an episode that promises to be full of behind the scenes truth. You won&rsquo;t find the episode listed on Vice&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber">Cyber website</a> for obvious reasons, but it should be there in the podcast RSS feed, for now at least.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The Internet&rdquo; is just too big and too important to think about as being one thing these days, even if we constrain ourselves to the bits of it that are most popularly used in 2024 (RIP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> et al for most people, although I suppose hello <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)">Gemini</a>?). In considering the impact of things like generative AI, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/02/01/the-end-of-the-social-network">demise of the original vision</a> of social networks et al I&rsquo;ve found it far more manageable think of the internet as being layered.</p>
<p>This is a very unoriginal and frosty take. But thinking about what those layers are fixated my attention for a while.</p>
<p>Probably my favourite viewpoint on it, and certainly the most beautifully illustrated one, is <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest">Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s image</a> of &ldquo;our current social internet situation&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>At the top we have the Dark Forest of the &ldquo;clear web&rdquo;. These are your classic websites. The places you usually end up on if you click on the top Google search result, or indeed a lot of Google-owned properties themselves. They&rsquo;re open to almost anyone with a usable internet connection. In fact they&rsquo;re often desperately vying for your attention. For the most part they&rsquo;d in theory be representative of an older, more utopian, vision of the internet - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free">information wants to be free</a>, everyone <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2020/07/09/does-the-internet-still-give-us-a-voice/">deserves an equal voice</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;now that most citizens have the tools to engage in mass communication, do more of them have a voice in public debate? Has the web made the public sphere more accessible to a greater diversity of voices?</p>
<p>Many of the web’s early boosters were confident that the answer was yes. Mass media conglomerates would soon dissolve and the net would give rise to an army of Davids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only problem is that we&rsquo;ve ruined it.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest">Appleton&rsquo;s writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By choosing advertising as the currency that underpins the internet, and then creating algorithms optimised to focus your attention on a particular page within the sprawling morass available in an environment where quantity is more predictably lucrative than quality, we&rsquo;ve ended up in a digital world with where of weirdly worded near-identical sites infused with surveillance trackers between a vomitorium of lurid adverts compete with each other to tell you which mail-order mattress you should buy, invisibly ranked by referral commission, when all you wanted to do was learn how to sleep better. Whilst <a href="https://foxprinteditorial.com/2023/05/11/will-ai-replace-writers-it-already-is/">human writers being replaced</a> by <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/30/cory-doctorow-reminds.html">very mid AI text generators</a> is a real and important issue, let&rsquo;s not forget that there are an indeterminate number of dissatified human writers who are currently paid to write <em>for</em> the AI algorithms in the first place.</p>
<p>I think most of the popular social networks, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter et al. largely fit into this bucket. Oftentimes they require you to sign up in order to access what lies beneath. But they&rsquo;re generally open to all. At least all who are happy to sign away a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/20/what-you-really-sign-up-for-when-you-use-social-media.html">vast and unreadable set of rights</a> - the infamous yet ubiquitous &ldquo;terms and conditions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sometimes their content is indexed and algorithmically hoovered up by search engines and, increasingly, faceless AI bots, in the same way that any other website is. Other times their data is a preciously guarded hoard, unavailable to &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo;. But as soon as you sign your various rights away, up until the point where they decide they don&rsquo;t want you there any more,  it&rsquo;s all there, searchable, exploitable, demanding your attention irrespective of whether you had actually planned to spend the evening watching people scream at each other about whether a school really did provide litter trays for their students who identified as cats (spoiler: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/urban-myth-litter-boxes-schools-became-gop-talking-point-rcna51439">they did not</a>) or sing <a href="https://time.com/5929245/sea-shanty-tiktok-2021/">sea shanties</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little incentive to present your whole, honest, self in these places. Your genuine interest in, say, providing a financially secure life for your family will translate to 6 months of every website you visit featuring adverts for the next <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp">shitcoin</a> destined to <a href="https://unu.edu/press-release/un-study-reveals-hidden-environmental-impacts-bitcoin-carbon-not-only-harmful-product">pollute the planet</a> until being rug-pulled away from anyone unlucky enough to have been suckered into the promise of a lifetime of financial freedom.</p>
<p>And if the algorithmised ads don&rsquo;t get you, the polarised populace of the place may. No-one wants to be the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character">Main Character</a>. Everyone has said something in their lives that if taken entirely out of context and presented in the worst possible light is likely enough for a few million people to hate-scream at you about. And the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/facebook-weighs-your-reactions-more-than-your-likes_n_58b7044ce4b019d36d0fe13c">&ldquo;here&rsquo;s something that will annoy you&rdquo; algorithms</a> will ensure that they are provided the chance to do so.</p>
<p>Why &ldquo;Dark Forest&rdquo;? It <a href="https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1">comes from</a> a parallel <a href="https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1">Yancey Strickler makes</a> to the amazing sci-fi trilogy (well, I&rsquo;ve only read book 1, but <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/27/everyone-was-right.html">it was great</a>) &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">The Three-Body Problem</a>&rdquo;. In pondering on why humanity hasn&rsquo;t yet seen all that convincing proof of alien life, Liu Cixin writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why no alien visitors to our planet? Perhaps there are no aliens, or perhaps the inhabitants of the rest of the galaxy just know that to speak out, to make contact, invites only risk, only predation. Why is the open web seemingly populated mostly by adtech infused &lsquo;brands&rsquo; and extremely partial views of the most theoretically enviable parts of every influencer&rsquo;s lifestyle? Not because all the real people actually vanished. We didn&rsquo;t actually turn into one-dimensional caricatures of ourselves.  We&rsquo;re just keeping much of our lives out of the reach of our perceived predators.</p>
<p>So many netizens have slunk away to the cozy web for some respite. The idea that large &ldquo;open&rdquo; - well, open only in the sense of letting everyone sign up - social networks are there to connect us with the people we know and love for the betterment of all our relationships has <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/social-media-divides-us/">obviously failed</a>. Many of those not still publicly arguing about whether ivermectin cures 5G or how bad their neighbour&rsquo;s kids are have substantially shifted their focus to places that are less visible, more hidden, less able to have whatever gems of wisdom they contain brutally scraped by Google for it&rsquo;s publisher-damaging, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-featured-answers-aim-to-distill-truthbut-often-get-it-wrong-1510847867">often inaccurate</a>, &ldquo;answer box&rdquo;, or, in more recent times, by hungry <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/generative-ai-models-are-sucking-data-up-from-all-over-the-internet-yours-included/">AI bots looking for massive training data</a>.</p>
<p>In this category we&rsquo;re largely talking about chat services; think WhatsApp groups, Discord, or Slack. Often invite only, rarely searchable from the outer world, and - as yet - less infused by bots, humans acting like bots or optimised advertising. It feels easier and safer to build real relationships here; to say what&rsquo;s on your mind, to talk to people who share your interests.</p>
<p>The downside of course is that they&rsquo;re generally ephemeral. The wisdom you espouse, the photos of your friends, the stuff you find meaning in there is probably going to have gone, at least in a practical sense, by the time you want to revisit it in the more distant future. Random person X who would have enjoyed hearing what you had to say, but doesn&rsquo;t happen to be signed up to same same channel of the same service at the same time, is probably not going to be able to. People who never knew others like them existed may never find out that they do if their dialogue is restricted to these spaces.</p>
<p>Information from these spaces is also hard to link to, hard to share with others. Want your friend to see part of a Whatsapp chat or a Discord conversation from a specific channel? Oftentimes sending screenshots, with the commensurate limitations of doing so, is the only practical way. Of course, those same screenshots will themselves become lost over time.</p>
<p>And if the service becomes unfashionable, too expensive or otherwise annoying for the company who runs it - it&rsquo;s hardly impossible to imagine even the behemoth WhatsApp being shuttered one day by its owner who already had a similar-seeming product <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/19/facebook-buys-whatsapp-16bn-deal">when they purchased it</a> if they felt like they could get away with it - there&rsquo;s a good chance that everything is lost. This stuff doesn&rsquo;t appear on the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.  But it&rsquo;s a safer place to be yourself, to reveal your inner workings, to open yourself up in.</p>
<p>From Yancey Strickler&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://ystrickler.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1">Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Maggie&rsquo;s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We create tiny underground burrows of Slack channels, Whatsapp groups, Discord chats, and Telegram streams that offer shelter and respite from the aggressively public nature of Facebook, Twitter, and every recruiter looking to connect on LinkedIn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does it work? From <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">Venkatesh Rao&rsquo;s formative article</a>, it&rsquo;s all about very human interactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the Dark Forest and Cozy Web exists a hybrid category - information available in entirely open formats to anyone who actively requests it, but largely hidden from those who haven&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s often unindexed by the web search engines and fairly inaccessible to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know that it exists. Think subscriber-only email newsletters, RSS feeds, that kind of thing. The rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> and its competitors have brought email newsletters to the modern consciousness - although Substack  isn&rsquo;t actually the best example here, as its free newsletters are typically archived as openly accessible webpages too. But the general idea of email newsletters has probably been around for a good four decades or so.</p>
<p>Finally, deep below the Cozy Web, we see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web">Dark Web</a>. That&rsquo;s somewhere beyond the typical reach of most humans and their bot counterparts. Its content doesn&rsquo;t appear on search engines. Clicking on a link in your basic default home web-browser will not get you there. Rather you&rsquo;d need to get special software and/or authorisation to see it, even if you had a way of knowing it existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s encrypted. Anonymity is a key value - unlike visiting a surface web, a clear web, website, a darknet site does not know where in the world you&rsquo;re tuning in from if everything is working well. <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is probably the most famous of these systems. If you ever see what appear to be weblinks that end in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion">.onion</a> then that&rsquo;s a Tor site you&rsquo;ll need a (freely available, one option <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">here</a> - and these days easy enough to use) special browser to access.</p>
<p>This technology clearly has the side effect of making users very hard to police. Thus, unfortunately, much of its content is ethically or legally dubious.</p>
<p>Moore and Rid&rsquo;s 2016 article <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2016.1142085">Cryptopolitik and the Darknet</a> included an attempt to analyse the content of thousands of .onion addresses and found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results suggest that the most common uses for websites on Tor hidden services are criminal, including drugs, illicit finance and pornography involving violence, children and animals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common commodity they found on sale was pharmaceutical or recreational drugs. The bulk of the finance sites were around Bitcoin-based money laundering, selling stolen credit card details, bank accounts and counterfeit currency. Let&rsquo;s not spell out what&rsquo;s encompassed in the third category above.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/09/guide-dark-webs-lighter-side/">don&rsquo;t get the idea that it&rsquo;s all terrible</a> - Tor and its ilk provides a way to access information from countries that cruelly block its citizens from being able access much of the conventional internet, including from the likes of <a href="https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2023/12/amnesty-international-website-launches-on-tor-network-to-help-universal-access/">Amnesty International</a> . Big news sites like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50150981">BBC</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2022/may/30/guardian-launches-tor-onion-service">The Guardian</a> have a presence. Whistleblowers can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop">share their information</a> with the organisations who can leverage it to make the world a better place, with a higher level of impunity. And, sad to say, some people reputedly find sourcing the drugs they need for their medical conditions easier via these unofficial channels than the methods that in-the-light society has made available to them.</p>
<p>Maggie Appleton <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web">credits</a> Venkatesh Rao for the cozy web terminology. Venkatesh himself illustrated his view of the &ldquo;complexity of the extended internet universe&rdquo; in what I think is his <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">original post on the matter</a>.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This version, whilst less aesthetically pleasing than Appleton&rsquo;s beautiful illustration - but still nicer than anything I myself could accomplish - holds two dimensions within it. Imagining it as a two dimensional graph, the horizontal axis moves left to right from sites entirely hidden in the dark through to the &ldquo;well-lit&rdquo; conventional web on the right. The vertical axis deals with the level of security the content is held under, from entirely open at the top through to information that&rsquo;s  locked behind complex security technologies and procedures at the bottom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The x-axis itself is the private-to-public boundary, marked by email for most of us. The y-axis is the high-risk to low-risk boundary, marked by security stronger/weaker than simple passwords for most of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of stuff in the very-private very-visible top left quadrant for obvious reasons - beyond things like accidental data leaks.</p>
<p>Bottom left is the Dark Web, as described above. Full of private information, of secret activity, of often illicit transactions. It&rsquo;s high risk stuff where privacy is essential for users to complete their goals, but stuffed behind both technological and human security systems far beyond what you&rsquo;d need to provide in order to log onto Facebook.</p>
<p>Top right is the Dark Forest - the modern-day web, infused with business doing their best to make you see their adverts, to persuade you to buy their wares, to penetrate into your mind, into your email inbox. No security is needed to venture into this content. Everything is in dazzling light, actively pushed onto your eyeballs by search engines, advertising networks, and so on. So much is advertising funded. The more you see it, willingly or otherwise, the more they get paid.</p>
<p>That leaves the Cozy Web, which within this schema is situated in the bottom right. There is a certain amount of security to navigate. You need a special app (e.g. WhatsApp), an account, maybe even an invite. The content isn&rsquo;t indexed by Google or forced into the faces of unsuspecting &lsquo;X&rsquo; users (or for that matter trivially searchable by malicious X users). But when you&rsquo;re in there, the chat is frequently low risk, stuff that doesn&rsquo;t feel private in the same sense that your medical records do. It might be your friends' groupchat, which is mostly just all that stuff you&rsquo;d banter about IRL if you saw each other a bit more, or your colleagues' thoughtstreams - the digital post-pandemic alternative to the watercooler, sanitised in the same sort of way. All in all, there&rsquo;s no need or active desire to hide this area of the internet from the FBI in the heads of most of its users, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;boringly private&rdquo; to use Rao&rsquo;s description with both the benefits and drawbacks such an environment brings.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780802163462">In Ascension</a> by Martin MacInnes.</p>
<p>We start by learning about the childhood of our heroine, Leigh. She grew up in Rotterdam, a city surrounded by and threatened by, water - a portent of the future ravages of climate change. Her family life was not at all what one would hope for.</p>
<p>Years later though, she&rsquo;s gotten out of it all. Life amongst water surely influenced her though. She studied as marine biologist, and later gets involved in a ship-bound expedition to investigate what appears to be an unprecedented anomaly discovered in the ocean.</p>
<p>One thing leads to another, and she&rsquo;ll eventually get involved in a mission to investigate another anomaly, one much further away. Nonetheless, no far how far away you go,  it&rsquo;s impossible to entirely evade the more conventional trials and tribulations of day-to-day life as a human.</p>
<p>The book <a href="https://thefantasyreviews.com/2023/03/20/book-review-of-in-ascension-by-martin-macinnes/">has been described</a> as genre-defying. In part it&rsquo;s pretty sciencey science-fiction, something that based on some reviews I&rsquo;ve seen not everyone gets on well with.  But it never strays far from much more human topics; psychology, connection, relationships functional or otherwise. There&rsquo;s ever present mysteries, meditations on Big Questions, and just enough ambiguity to be memorable and engaging rather than frustrating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautifully written, conveying well a real and detailed sense of the wonder and majesty of the natural world, the wider ecology, and humanity&rsquo;s place within it. Profound, philosophical and truly fascinating; justly longlisted for the <a href="https://thebookerprizes.com/">Booker Prize</a>. I now want to read all the author&rsquo;s other books.</p>

			 <p>Apparently even more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/19/ministers-confirm-plan-to-ban-use-of-mobile-phones-in-schools-in-england">British children have smartphones</a> than I&rsquo;d have guessed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ofcom data says 97% of children have one by the age of 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of introducing some official guidance on a &ldquo;ban&rdquo; (severity left up to discretion) on kids using them in schools seems like a reasonable idea to me, even whilst already many schools do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a life-lesson on &ldquo;how to use your phone in a way that doesn&rsquo;t negatively impact your life&rdquo; introduced too. If anyone actually knows how to do that.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/18/air-canada-instructed.html">Air Canada instructed to honour a refund that their chatbot inadvertently promised</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/18/air-canada-instructed.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-02-18 11:46:23 &#43;0100">Feb 18, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/air-canada-must-honor-refund-policy-invented-by-airlines-chatbot/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After months of resisting, Air Canada was forced to give a partial refund to a grieving passenger who was misled by an airline chatbot inaccurately explaining the airline&rsquo;s bereavement travel policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feels like a good, important, decision. Would Air Canada have fought so hard if it was a human customer service agent that misled the company? There is no practical difference to the customer. Although to be fair, <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html">the ruling</a> suggests that maybe they would have, with the remarkable line that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air Canada argues it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants, or representatives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In which case why even have a customer services department? Are you supposed to be able to guess whether or not an agent is telling the truth every time you call them up?</p>
<p>In this case it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re talking about something that threatens the existence of the company. Air Canada, a company that measures its <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-earnings-1.6933613">quarterly revenue</a> in billions of dollars, isn&rsquo;t going to go bankrupt if they give the customer the $880 refund he was expecting.</p>
<p>In any case, if a company is going to replace its human customer service agents with chatbot customer service agents then they should surely be equally as liable for any misinformation.</p>
<p>As the judge <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In effect, Air Canada suggests the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions. This is a remarkable submission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to regard chatbots as being &ldquo;responsible for their own actions&rdquo;, well, some kind of radical legal shift would presumably be needed. It&rsquo;s also kind of insane. If chatbots have responsibilities then do they also have rights? Do we put them in chatbot jail if they say something wrong?</p>
<p>If what they actually mean is that whoever sold them the chatbot should be held responsible, well, there are surely already legal routes that can be used by Air Canada to claim damages against another company if they believe they&rsquo;ve been mis-sold something.</p>
<p>In no circumstance should it matter than the actual bereavement policy was somewhere else on their website. It&rsquo;s not the customer&rsquo;s responsibility to research the same question several times and try and guess which version the company actually meant to provide.</p>
<p>More from <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html">the ruling</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While a chatbot has an interactive component, it is still just a part of Air Canada’s website. It should be obvious to Air Canada that it is responsible for all the information on its website. It makes no difference whether the information comes from a static page or a chatbot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Air Canada argues Mr. Moffatt could find the correct information on another part of its website, it does not explain why the webpage titled “Bereavement travel” was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot. It also does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its website on another part of its website.</p>

			 <p>This multi-year miscarriage of justice is embarrassingly new to me, but then again so was an event that it has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/11/english-test-scandal-students-renew-fight-to-clear-names-after-10-years">recently been compared to</a> - the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/13/mr-bates-vs.html">Post Office Horizon scandal</a>.</p>
<p>A decade ago, one condition for foreign students who applied for a visa to come study in the UK was that they first had to pass a specific English test called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOEIC">Test of English for international communication</a> or Toeic. Although I haven&rsquo;t seen the questions, it sounds like it&rsquo;s quite basic, something that anyone reasonably fluent in English would do OK at. It&rsquo;s intent is merely to &ldquo;measure the everyday English skills of people working in an international environment&rdquo; rather than check whether you&rsquo;re PhD-level familiar with the literature of the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>The Home Office authorised 4 approved test providers that students could use to do this. One of these was US-based company, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_Testing_Service">Education Testing Service</a>&rdquo; aka ETS.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, TV show Panorama found <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26024375">that there was cheating going on in a couple of their centres</a>. As far as I can tell everyone agrees that this part is true: cheating definitely went on in 2 of around 90 centres ETS ran.</p>
<p>But rather more controversial was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/11/what-is-the-home-office-english-test-scandal">follow-up investigation that claimed</a> that of the ~58,000 students who sat that test in their centres over a 5 year period, over half &ldquo;had used deception&rdquo; and another 39% were questionable, entirely on the basis of some unspecified voice recognition technology analysis. Yes, the claim was that 97% of entrants cheated.</p>
<p>Consequently, these students had their visas revoked. This made it illegal for them to remain in the UK. At best they could hope to be simply thrown out of their (expensive) university courses. At worst some were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/11/it-destroyed-my-life-the-students-accused-of-cheating-in-english-tests">locked up in detention centres</a> and eventually deported, only to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/international-students-accused-cheating-english-toeic-windrush">live a life in disgrace</a> as their nearest and dearest were led to believe they were nothing but a foolish cheat.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.politics.co.uk/">politics.co.uk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then people started being rounded up. Families were woken in dawn raids, the husband separated from the wife and sent to detention centres ahead of deportation. It would have been a profoundly harrowing experience. These were students, not criminals. Their only crime had been to do a test recommended by the Home Office. But the full sadistic force of the state was brought down upon them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not even a entitlement right of appeal was given at first, at least without having first left the country.</p>
<p>All in all, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/11/english-test-scandal-students-renew-fight-to-clear-names-after-10-years">2500 were forcibly deported and another 7.2k have left the country after being threatened with arrest</a>. Others have ended up destitute and homeless, depressed or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/21/international-students-accused-cheating-english-toeic-windrush">suicidal</a>.</p>
<p>Since then at least 3600 of those students have won immigration appeals, although
the public records don&rsquo;t specify whether that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve been found to be innocent of cheating or for some other reason. But it was certainly the supposed cheating that put them in the position of needing an appeal in the first place.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many of the students have claimed they are entirely innocent and that any supposed evidence against them is extremely weak. The Home Office hadn&rsquo;t previously acknowledged let alone taken action based on that. But they were certainly aware of the issue.</p>
<p>In 2019, the National Audit Office found that the Home Office didn&rsquo;t have the expertise to validate the evidence provided by ETS, and that it had simply taken it at face value. They&rsquo;d made no real effort at all to investigate whether or not the accused had been incorrectly classified as cheats</p>
<p>Even earlier, <a href="https://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/03/23/disaster-for-theresa-may-as-legal-ruling-brings-student-deportations-to-a-halt/">in a 2016 tribunal case</a> that challenged the actions of the Home Office on these matters, the presiding judge found that none of the people representing the Home Office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>had &ldquo;any qualifications or expertise, vocational or otherwise, in the scientific subject matter of these appeals&rdquo;. At no time, in fact, had the Home Office had advice or input from a suitable expert. The criticisms of their witness statements &ldquo;were not addressed, much less answered, in their evidence&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Home Office&rsquo;s case that these students had committed fraud was &ldquo;entirely dependent&rdquo; on ETS. The tribunal found the Home Office accepted uncritically everything reported by the firm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the complainants in that case, a Mr Qadir who had been accused of cheating the test, of course spoke &ldquo;excellent English&rdquo; when testifying.</p>
<p>Thousands of the other accused people were waiting on the results of this case to use as evidence in their own appeals. Some of their cases had specifically been put on hold until this tribunal&rsquo;s verdict was out. However, at the time the committee <a href="https://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/04/21/secretive-legal-committee-buries-ruling-against-theresa-may/">refused to report on their findings</a>, as important and universal as they were, making it very difficult to cite elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decision means that the case cannot be cited, except under very strict and laborious conditions, in other appeals. It means many thousands of people who have been unjustly deported will not even know of its existence. The decision makes the ruling against Theresa May legally useless. It’s as if it never happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lawyers went on to accuse the committee of &ldquo;an abuse of power&rdquo;, with their decision to not publish what went on as being &ldquo;plainly hostile to common sense&rdquo;. <a href="https://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/04/21/secretive-legal-committee-buries-ruling-against-theresa-may/">Accusations flew</a> that the decision whether to publish or hide the proceedings of the cases seen by this committee were very much dependent on whether the case showed the Home Office in a positive light.</p>
<p>The years this was all happening in were well into the still-ongoing inhumane period where the at-the-time British Home Secretary Theresa May was explicitly trying to create a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office_hostile_environment_policy">hostile environment</a>&rdquo; in theory for illegal immigrants, but in practice for anyone that in any sense didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;look British&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Being able to tout ever bigger numbers of punishments against and deportations of immigrants who were in Britain illegally - the situation these poor students found themselves in when stripped of their visas due to having been accused of cheating on a test -  was exactly what the government, particularly the Home Office, would have wanted. Clearly there was little incentive - outside of, you know, the basic tenets of justice and humanity - for May&rsquo;s department to look into it.</p>
<p>May now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/31/theresa-may-says-she-regrets-using-term-hostile-environment">regrets</a> the phase &ldquo;hostile environment&rdquo;, but so far that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have helped many of the folk who unjustly suffered, <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/02/03/asylum-seekers-fleeing.html">nor lessened the hostility</a> of the environment itself.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;97% of people are cheats&rdquo; figure just seems prima facie implausible to me. Surely it&rsquo;s well beyond the threshold that basic common sense should have caused an immediate halt to the punitive proceedings and further investigations to have urgently been done a decade ago.</p>
<p>In the unlikely case that cheating was really that endemic, there have also been scenarios suggested whereby it may have been the centres, rather than the students, that were cheating. And if it had turned out that 97% of individual students had cheated, well that surely points to a systemic problem with the structure of the testing regime than something individually defective about almost every single person who took the test.</p>
<p>But, in any case, that&rsquo;s all a meaningless thought experiment when it seems like there&rsquo;s no real evidence that cheating on anything like this scale ever happened in the first place.</p>
<p>Also to add to the mix: the inconvenient fact that several of the students entangled in this mess were provably perfectly fluent in English well before they took the test. To the extent it&rsquo;s basically inconceivable that they could have failed what is a fairly basic test. Hence there would be absolutely no incentive for them to have paid someone else to take it for them, which is generally the allegation being made, or engage in any other such nefarious scheme.</p>
<p>One such example of this is poor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/24/facing-destitution-the-student-accused-by-uk-of-cheating-at-english">Kishor</a>. He successfully completed a degree in English literature, worked as an English teacher, and worked with NATO troops in Afghanistan, which required passing an English test, before coming to the UK to pursue a business degree which is the point at which he took the Toiec test. He probably speaks better English than I do. Nonetheless he was amongst the crowd that were accused of cheating.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watching <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-apprentice-uk/seasons/18">The Apprentice - season 18</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes reassuring when things stay the same - and here once more we have a bunch of buzzword-laden people, with apparent levels of self-confidence most of us could only dream of, doing whatever it takes to impress the master of awkwardly delivering badly-scripted jokes and pointing at people, Lord Sugar, all in the name of getting an investment.</p>
<p>I was just looking up the iconic 2010 contestant Stuart &ldquo;The Brand&rdquo; Baggs to be sure of getting his justifiably famous quote right - &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a one-trick pony. I&rsquo;m a whole field of ponies&rsquo; - only to discover that sadly <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3205751/Apprentice-star-Stuart-Baggs-Brand-buried-today.html">he died in 2015</a>, aged just 27. Lord Sugar left a floral tribute.</p>
<p>Another thing I recently learned is that in order to keep who wins a total secret until broadcast, the show apparently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/apprentice-films-two-endings-show-26549152">films two different endings</a>, one where each of the two finalists win and the other one loses. Even the two candidates concerned don&rsquo;t learn who won until much later - the day before the final show is broadcast. Same for the production team.</p>
<p>Sometimes even the same ending has to be filmed more than once. Harpreet Kaur, the winner of the 2022 season, had to have her &ldquo;winning&rdquo; ending filmed twice because she didn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/03/25/the-apprentices-harpreet-kaur-reveals-her-winning-moment-was-filmed-twice-16345813/">the right level of excitement</a>&rdquo; the first time through. I suppose it is probably hard to muster the TV-level appropriate extremes of performative excitement when there&rsquo;s a good chance what you&rsquo;re celebrating never happened. I&rsquo;m not sure how she reconciles that with her quote in the same article that &ldquo;there’s no acting&rdquo; in the Apprentice, but there we go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch with interest when it&rsquo;s time for the 2024 final to see if this cohort&rsquo;s acting-like-a-winner skills are better than one might imagine.</p>

<p>Eberhard ended up <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/06/eberhard/">suing Musk</a> for all manner of things: libel, defamation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, and failure to pay his wages, The only reason Musk is even allowed to call himself the founder of Tesla is because he effectively purchased the right to do so <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/tesla-ceo-settles-for-founder-title/2088887/">as part of the legal settlement</a>.</p>

			 <p>Elon Musk has implanted a microchip in someone else&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>No, this isn&rsquo;t some weird conspiracy theory, it actually happened.</p>
<p>Well, it probably wasn&rsquo;t him, but rather someone a bit more qualified to do so from a company he founded, <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> whose stated mission goal is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a generalized brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs today and unlock human potential tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/19/elon-musk-neuralink-human-trials-brain-implant">FDA approved operation</a>. The end goal is to let folk use their computers just by thinking, developing a &ldquo;Brain Computer Interface&rdquo;. This has obvious applications for people who can&rsquo;t use the limbs for instance. In the future the same technology might be used to restore vision to the blind.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all exciting and potentially &ldquo;good-for-the-world&rdquo; stuff. If only the show wasn&rsquo;t being run by Mr Musk I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d be slightly less worried about it. It seems like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/29/elon-musk-neuralink-first-human-brain-chip-implant">The Guardian</a> couldn&rsquo;t resist a bit of a commentary on the guy and what he chooses to spend his time on in-between whatever running his businesses involves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In follow-up tweets sent in between arguing about video games and bantering with far-right influencers, the businessman said the first Neuralink product was called Telepathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Telepathy of course, despite its potential for revolutionary good, also sounds like something <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/01/30/elon-musks-brain-chips-brilliant-a-black-mirror-nightmare-20194917/">straight out of Black Mirror</a>. Musk might have a vision for it beyond the medical it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking in 2017, Mr Musk said the ‘merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence’ would be necessary if humans were to stay economically valuable.</p>

			 <p>I feel like a bare minimum criteria for the criminal abrogation of the UK&rsquo;s international responsibilities and sense of humanity that is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-61782866">the plan to send our asylum seekers to Rwanda</a> should be that people from Rwanda are not currently finding the need to seek asylum <em>from</em> Rwanda in the UK.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/27/revealed-uk-granted-asylum-to-rwandan-refugees-while-arguing-country-was-safe">the Observer:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four Rwandans were granted refugee status in the UK over “well-founded” fears of persecution at the same time as the government was arguing in court and parliament that the east African country was a safe place to send asylum seekers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, are we just going to put those who were compelled to flee Rwanda on a flight to&hellip;Rwanda?</p>
<p>Even if Rwanda was the paradise-for-all that the Government attempted to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bill-to-make-clear-rwanda-is-a-safe-country-and-stop-the-boats">legislatively wishcast</a> into being the case recently,  the idea is entirely unworkable, unethical and <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/23/the-conservative-party.html">illegal</a> anyway. But come on, surely even some people who would otherwise support this dreadful culture-war nonsense might concur that the idea that is is OK to send asylum seekers <em>to</em> a country that legitimate asylum seekers come <em>from</em> is a non-starter.</p>
<p>One person fleeing from Rwanda saw a successful asylum claim here literally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/27/revealed-uk-granted-asylum-to-rwandan-refugees-while-arguing-country-was-safe">the day after</a> the Government finished arguing that it was safe in the Supreme Court.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched season 6 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-crown/seasons/6">The Crown</a>.</p>
<p>This is the final season of this &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/12/crown-netflix-fact-fiction/617278/">is it fact or fiction?</a>&rdquo; drama documentary, which nonetheless will also probably become the primary reference material for royal life in the minds of some of its viewers.</p>
<p>It mainly focuses on the years from somewhere around 1997 to maybe around 2006, although with shoutouts here and there to times longer ago - we are all a product of our past to some extent, even, or perhaps especially, the royals - and perhaps as recently as 2022 in the slightly strange finale.</p>
<p>1997 is of course the year that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales">Princess Diana died</a>, an event that the series focuses on plenty, before and after. These are also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair#Prime_Minister_(1997%E2%80%932007)">Blair years</a>, her rivalry in terms of public opinion depicted as giving the Queen some very strange dreams.</p>
<p>Focus then moves to teen drama as Prince William tries to win the heart of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales">Kate Middleton</a>, which her mother is pretty enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>Prince Harry is in the midst of his initial Bad Boy phase, dressing up as a Nazi, drugs, partying, all that kind of classic Prince Gone Wild stuff. Although it has to be said that the very idea that he, his brother, and a load of other posh people routinely go to fancy dress <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/14/monarchy.sandralaville">&ldquo;colonials and natives&rdquo; parties</a> in the first place isn&rsquo;t wildly reassuring.</p>
<p>The Queen Mother dies, and the final episode then dwells on the preparation of of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_London_Bridge">Operation London Bridge</a> - the planning for the death of the monarch, an operation that had actually existed since the 1960s in one way or another.</p>
<p>Not everyone loved this season. The reviews were bad enough that it made Dominic West, the actor who played Prince Charles in it, <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/dominic-west-crown-finally-ending-200000615.html">stay in bed</a> for two days. TV critic Nick Hilton <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/crown-season-6-part-2-netflix-quality-b2463834.html">sees it</a> as a symbol of the Netflix&rsquo;s &lsquo;decline in popularity and quality&rsquo;. Even its creator, Peter Morgan, is <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-crown-creator-admits-not-sad-final-season_uk_6555dc85e4b0e4767012f09a">relieved to see it end</a>. But when you&rsquo;ve watched the first five series and actually remember some of the events of the sixth actually taking place, it&rsquo;s hard not to give it a go.</p>

<p>Exactly the same setup as in <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/09/watched-season-of.html">the first season</a>, but with a new bunch of people for me to worry about their future sanity.</p>
<p>Doing tasks by day and trying to figure out who&rsquo;s leading a double life by night, it remains extremely compulsive even if it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m not sure is overly healthy. The last episode is quite something. I got far too invested in that emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the true cost of all the automation-driven unemployment criti-hype: while we&rsquo;re nowhere near a place where bots can steal your job, we&rsquo;re certainly at the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1695740600">Sweet Justice</a> by Tkay Maidza.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkay_Maidza">Tkay</a> is a Zimbabwean-Australian rapper who recently(ish) released her second full album, 7 years after <a href="https://album.link/i/1219489514">the first</a>.</p>
<p>This was the first album for a long while that I learned about by virtue of hearing it on the radio, just like it&rsquo;s the 1990s. Sweet Justice itself is a multi-genre extravaganza, <a href="http://www.womeninpop.com/news-home/interview-tkay-maidza-on-her-new-album-sweet-justice">apparently themed</a> on the idea of breaking up with one&rsquo;s own past, leaving the negative influences behind.</p>

<p>This (taken from some random Discord if I remember correctly) might be a little simplistic in some cases. And perhaps it even plays into the more ludicrous conspiracy theories around the WEF. Nonetheless it remains a constant source of astonishment to me how many big and important problems humanity at least has a good idea of how to solve but seemingly chooses not to.</p>
<p>For the most part I suspect that comes more from us having inadvertently created structures such that we are disincentivised from doing so - especially at the individual level. Rather than, for instance, pure malice.</p>

			 <p>Just when I imagined I couldn&rsquo;t learn anything new about the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/care-workers-pay-sleepin-shifts-b1866861.html">often</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/28/foreign-care-workers-invited-to-uk-exploited-on-grand-scale-says-union">dreadful</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/29/exploitation-and-low-pay-causing-poverty-among-care-workers-tuc-finds">conditions</a> that many of the people doing some of the most important and oftentimes challenging work imaginable - caring for other people and their needs - are subject to in the UK, I learn that the sector may be increasingly infused with actual slavery.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/19/modern-slavery-care-sector-england-brexit">The Guardian</a> at the end of last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Post-Brexit restrictions on the free movement of workers from the EU have contributed to modern slavery becoming “a feature” of the care sector in England the Care Quality Commission has told MPs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Care Quality Commission made 4 referrals about modern slavery in the period of 2021-22, vs a predicted 50 by the end of the most recent year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unseenuk.org/">Unseen UK</a>, an organisation that runs a modern slavery and exploitation hotline, reported that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67151672">over 700 care workers</a> called in 2022.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unseen&rsquo;s chief executive, Andrew Wallis, says the current approach has led to a rise in &ldquo;labour abuse and exploitation&rdquo; and is &ldquo;a disaster&rdquo; for many workers.
&ldquo;Very vulnerable people are being cared for by very vulnerable people,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Nottingham Rights Lab <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Research/Beacons-of-Excellence/Rights-Lab/resources/reports-and-briefings/2022/July/The-vulnerability-of-paid-migrant-live-in-care-workers-in-London-to-modern-slavery.pdf">produced a report in 2022</a> that detailed what makes the conditions especially of migrant &ldquo;live-in&rdquo; care workers - those who stay in their client&rsquo;s home around-the-clock - particularly vulnerable to these conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Employment status, business models, and the role of intermediaries</li>
<li>Information asymmetry between care workers and intermediaries</li>
<li>The emotionally and physically intensive nature of live-in care work, blurring of boundaries between work and private life</li>
<li>Barriers to exercising rights at work: sick leave, time off, redundancy/notice, health and safety at work</li>
<li>Individual risk and resilience factors</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only driver by a long margin, but I can&rsquo;t help but think that any scheme that makes your right to live in a country dependent on you doing whatever your employer demands of you is ripe for abuse. This of course isn&rsquo;t limited to the care sector.</p>

<p>Once a year, ever since 1947, a priest works their way through the airport giving the planes a &ldquo;festive blessing from God&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781474623025">Time Shelter</a> by Georgi Gospodinov.</p>
<p>This was a fascinating and, at times, darkly hilarious read. The narrator tells the story of his life after meeting Gaustine, a mysterious intermittently-present therapist who develops a new treatment for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease">Alzheimer' disease</a>.</p>
<p>The treatment involves recreating the environment of their past for the period during which the patient felt most at home and secure, the period their body remembers most clearly irrespective of their state of mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very successful, leading to the opening of many such clinics with rooms that replicate the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and so on in perfect detail.</p>
<p>As time goes on though it&rsquo;s not only patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease that want to attend these clinics, these ‘time shelters’. People of all kinds are drawn to re-experience their favoured period of the past, a place-in-time that they remember - accurately or not - as being a safe and happy time to live. Anything to take a temporal break from the stress and angst of modern-day life.</p>
<p>The movement expands way beyond the medical. Nostalgia increasingly permeates everything. Radio stations from decades past are re-set up. Newspapers from 30 years ago are reprinted, as though the events 3 decades past are today’s news. Politicians of course see the potential for using this nostalgia to the end of their own electoral gains and get in on the act.</p>
<p>Whole towns from past eras are re-built in something close to their original form. Eventually entire countries have referendums on which decade was their golden one, which perceived era they should legally and culturally return to.</p>
<p>Different countries naturally see different periods as their most glorious days, leading to a set of time rather than location based international alliances. As well as, I suppose, time-travel-adjacent experiences when crossing borders between them.</p>
<p>State sponsored re-enactments of historical events become the norm, although down that route some danger lies.</p>
<p>Just the now-triggering word ‘referendum’ makes it hard not to see some satirical intent regarding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum">referendum my own country held</a> now 8 years ago where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/26/our-politics-of-nostalgia-is-a-sure-sign-of-present-day-decay">some people consider</a> a good amount of voting preference may have originated from a longing for (semi-mythological) times of yore. A time when Britain ruled the waves, when men were men and women stayed at home, that kind of thing. But the book&rsquo;s treatment of this theme is done in a way that never grates.</p>
<p>The novel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/books/international-booker-prize-time-shelter.html">won a Booker Prize</a> last year. I’m not surprised. Embedded within the story is a wonderful mix of philosophy, politics, ethics, history, psychology, sociology and more, although it is never hard to read. It has moments of hilarity, moments of darkness, moments of poignancy. Very recommended.</p>

<p>It seems that many of them came from the failure of the system to maintain ACID principles.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.</p>

<p>The speaker is Professor Steven Murdoch, who also <a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2021/07/15/what-went-wrong-with-horizon-learning-from-the-post-office-trial/">wrote a blog post</a> about this that contains examples of the faults he&rsquo;s talking about taken from the <a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bates-and-Ors-v-the-Post-Office-Ltd-2019-EWHC-3408-QB.pdf#page=105">judgement report</a> of the 2019 legal case of Alan Bates and others vs Post Office Limited.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s not only <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">books</a>, <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html">music</a> and <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/15/amazon-appears-to.html">product listings</a> that are being created, or contaminated, by generative AI content. It&rsquo;s entire websites in some cases.</p>
<p>This report might be considered ancient given the pace these things move, but nonetheless: back in May 2023 <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/newsbots-ai-generated-news-websites-proliferating/">NewsGuard identified almost 50 &ldquo;news and information sites&rdquo;</a> whose content was almost entirely written by year-or-more-old generative AI technology.  Why? Well, as with everything, it&rsquo;s driven by the <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">enshittifying</a> business model we&rsquo;ve settled on for much of the internet. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/10/21/the-real-ai.html">always the business model</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artificial intelligence tools are now being used to populate so-called content farms, referring to low-quality websites around the world that churn out vast amounts of clickbait articles to optimize advertising revenue, NewsGuard found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This motivation is nothing new. We&rsquo;ve all become all too familiar with click-bait <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm">content farms</a> over the past few years. It&rsquo;s just that traditionally they tended to have at least some <a href="https://www.mediabistro.com/be-inspired/work-spaces/year-content-farm-writer/">involvement of a human</a>. Generative AI&rsquo;s tendency to create <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a> seems almost perfectly aimed at automating those poor folks' jobs, for better or worse.</p>
<p>And how were NewsGuard so confident about the origin of the content on those sites? Well, at least in part, it comes from the now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23697218/ai-generated-spam-fake-user-reviews-as-an-ai-language-model">increasingly ubiquitous</a> technique of of looking for ChatGPT-style error messages that made all the way through the &ldquo;publication process&rdquo;, if that&rsquo;s not too grand a word for the resulting low-effort word spew</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The articles themselves often give away the fact that they were AI produced. For example, dozens of articles on BestBudgetUSA.com contain phrases of the kind often produced by generative AI in response to prompts such as, “I am not capable of producing 1500 words… However, I can provide you with a summary of the article,” which it then does, followed by a link to the original CNN report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They provide a screenshot of an absolutely perfect example. &ldquo;The News Network&rdquo; had an article with this curious headline at one point in time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were also some rather more subtle clues as to the AI source in some cases, <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/newsbots-ai-generated-news-websites-proliferating/">their article</a> goes into more detail.</p>
<p>That was then. More recetnly they&rsquo;ve assembled a newer <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/ai-tracking-center/">list of 634 AI-generated sites</a> that each meet all of these criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There is clear evidence that a substantial portion of the site’s content is produced by AI.</li>
<li>&hellip;there is strong evidence that the content is being published without significant human oversight&hellip;</li>
<li>The site is presented in a way that an average reader could assume that its content is produced by human writers or journalists&hellip;</li>
<li>The site does not clearly disclose that its content is produced by AI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In evaluating this we should remember that by virtue of their underlying method - largely involving searching for common large language model error messages that accidentally made it to publication - they&rsquo;re only going to find the least careful, most egregious examples of this kind of exploitation. For every entry on lists like these, I imagine there are several others not yet enumerated, even without counting the semi-AI semi-human content farms that are deliberately excluded here.</p>

Now two great forces of <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">enshittification</a> - dubious use of generative AI and Amazon - have collided to produce bizarre listings for physical products.</p>
<p>How do we know this for sure? Well, aside from using common sense, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036156/openai-policy-amazon-ai-listings">The Verge searched Amazon for the phrase &ldquo;OpenAI policy&rdquo;</a> and found a whole bunch of products for sale whose name was little more than a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>-style apology. Presumably no human - or at least no human who reads English - was all that involved in creating the listing. Some of the product photos don&rsquo;t look exactly real either.</p>
<p>This was one of my favourites:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The &ldquo;About this item&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t very human either. I&rsquo;m so excited at being able to buy something to complete [task 1], [task 2] and [task 3] when I didn&rsquo;t know that even $2000 chairs were used for  more than one common task.</p>
<p>Amazon seems to have taken down most of the offending articles now, but it was fun of a kind while it lasted.</p>

<p>What is a global risk?</p>

<p>“Global risk” is defined as the possibility of the occurrence of an event or condition which, if it occurs, would negatively impact a significant proportion of global GDP, population or natural resources.</p>

<p>There are certainly <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2024/01/14/a-huge-number.html">a lot of elections coming up</a> for us to worry about being affected by this kind of stuff. And many other domains in which incorrect or misleading information will make the world a much worse place to live in.</p>
<p>In the long term, it&rsquo;s mostly environmental risks that they believe will cause the most severe risks. Number 1 is extreme weather, which has already devastated quite some lives.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office">Mr Bates vs The Post Office</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the <a href="https://planetradio.co.uk/hits-radio/entertainment/television/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office/">nearly 15 million folk</a> so far who have tuned into this surprisingly impactful drama-based-on-fact about the battle between ex sub-post-master Mr Bates and his compatriots against the once-respectable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Limited">British Post Office</a>.</p>
<p>It reveals the ongoing story of what&rsquo;s now considered to be one of Britain&rsquo;s <a href="https://theconversation.com/mr-bates-vs-the-post-office-depicts-one-of-the-uks-worst-miscarriages-of-justice-heres-why-so-many-victims-didnt-speak-out-220513">worst miscarriages of justice</a>.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in 1999,  the Post Office brought in a new computer system called Horizon that it insisted the people who managed each branch of the post office - typically self-employed franchise partners known as sub-postmasters - use to do their accounting, stocktaking, reconciliation and other such financial type stuff. It was developed by a private company, ICL Pathway, who was owned by Fujitsu. Some version of Horizon is still in use today, although I hope it&rsquo;s not quite the same version for reasons that will become obvious.</p>
<p>For at least some post office branch managers, the day&rsquo;s takings would frequently fail to reconcile. The computer would tell the person in charge of the branch, the sub post-master, that they appear to have less money on hand than they should do. Their contract stated that they had to make up any shortfall, so Post Office HQ would insist that they pay back the difference out of their own pocket.</p>
<p>The discrepancies could amount to thousands of pounds a day, and so some of the post-masters were understandably reluctant to do so. Many could not even if they wanted to - these are not typically particularly rich people. Some insisted that the computer must be wrong, that there must be bugs in the system. There&rsquo;s an example of a person who called the helpdesk 90 times and but no useful help was provided.</p>
<p>But when these folk complained about the obvious issues with the computer system they were told that this isn&rsquo;t possible, the computer is always right and they are always wrong. And besides, they&rsquo;re the only one who is reporting these problems and no-one other than them has access to the system so it&rsquo;s obviously something <em>they&rsquo;re</em> doing. The &ldquo;something&rdquo; could include theft.</p>
<p>Both of these claims naturally turned out to be overt lies, although the sub post masters had no way to know that at the time.</p>
<p>And so the Post Office, which has special prosecution powers, started charging them with theft, false accounting and other such charges. All in all, they spent 16 years charging roughly 1 of their formerly respected employees a week, leading to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56718036">700 prosecutions</a>. Nearly 300 other sub post masters were prosecuted by other bodies for similar crimes.</p>
<p>Some of these prosecutions resulted in the person accused going to prison. Others were financially or emotionally ruined. They lost their income and life savings. Their communities became distrustful of them. Stress, health issues, family breakdowns occurred. Some plead guilty for lesser offences, taking the offered plea bargain even though they knew they were entirely innocent, too terrified to risk being found guilty of a more serious offence. In a few unbelivably tragic cases the accused postmasters took their own lives.</p>
<p>Rather than hundreds of employees suddenly deciding to become criminals, it it of course turned  out that the Horizon computer system did have issues. Worst yet, the Post Office lied about what it knew, disempowering and confusing each of hundreds of complainants in telling them that they were the only one, lying about the capabilities of the system. It went out of its way to not help the post office staff who called the Horizon helpline when the figures didn&rsquo;t balance, and later to do everything it could to deny the falsely accused, sometimes falsely imprisoned, victims the information they&rsquo;d need to prove their innocence. Sometimes they explicitly lied to the legal authorities.</p>
<p>The general story has been known to some extent for a while. Concerns were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32377013">raised by MPs</a> on behalf of their constituents in 2012, more than 10 years ago. The group &ldquo;Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance&rdquo; was set up 3 years before that to sue the Post Office over his issue. In fact Alan Bates, the titular hero of this documentary, first wrote to his Post Office bosses to raise concerns over Horizon fully 24 years ago, in 2000.</p>
<p>To be honest, without looking into it very much I&rsquo;d foolishly assumed it was a classic story of institutional incompetence and bad technology, of simply trusting the machine too much and having inadequate processes to set things straight. But this documentary strongly suggests that there was far more than that going on. There was deliberate attempts to mislead and victimise the sub postmasters, to smear their names, to lie to them, in order to protect - what? - money? The good name of the Post Office? The ability of the former Post Office CEO to be given the great honour a CBE - becoming a &ldquo;Commander of the Order of the British Empire&rdquo; - back in 2019 for &ldquo;Services to the Post Office&rdquo;? But whatever it was, it was at the expense of hundreds of innocent people&rsquo;s lives and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Whilst there has been a rather low-key government enquiry into this matter going on since 2020, it&rsquo;s only been in very recent times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/world/europe/uk-itv-mr-bates-vs-post-office.html">since this documentary highlighted the injustice so vividly</a>, that the government seems to have made it an actual priority to make some effort to clear the names of and compensate the victims of this corporate malfeasance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late for the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/post-office-horizon-it-scandal-compensation-l2f6xtdmd">59 who already died</a> of course. And it&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what compensation could make up for the destruction this has caused to many of their lives in the. But this is no excuse for not doing our best to compensate the victims and hold the perpetrators to account.</p>

			 <p>Adam Grant <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/opinion/israel-war-empathy-pain.html/">writes about</a> empathic stress. This is the numbness that can manifest when you feel empathy for people who are in obvious distress whilst simultaneously feeling that there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to help them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s potentially a lot of that going around at the moment; the ongoing wars, the ongoing pandemic, the ongoing environmental destruction, the other ongoing catastrophes of everyday life.</p>
<p>It might look to an observer like the emapthicaly stressed person just don&rsquo;t care - after all they&rsquo;re not &lsquo;doing&rsquo; anything. But it&rsquo;s a perfectly normal reaction when the pain of real empathy meets the frustration of being unable to help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giving to charity feels like a drop in the ocean. Posting on social media is a hornet&rsquo;s nest. Having concluded that nothing they do will make a difference, they start to become indifferent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This phenomenon is one of the potential darker sides of empathy, a human ability that on the surface seems like it should be wholly positive (although many researchers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review">disagree that it is</a>, for a variety of reasons). But when empathy can&rsquo;t result in meaningful action it can end up as distress, pain, depression.</p>
<p>Instead, Grant suggests we focus on compassion over empathy. What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy absorbs others' emotions as your own: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurting for you.&rdquo; Compassion focuses your action on their emotions: &ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re hurting, and I&rsquo;m here for you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to feel other people&rsquo;s pain, but rather overtly notice that their pain exists and offer some sort of comfort.</p>
<p>The comfort doesn&rsquo;t need to be something that solves the problem, that stops the cause of the pain. It can just be an acknowledgment that it exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most basic form of compassion is not assuaging distress but acknowledging it. When we can&rsquo;t make people feel better, we can still make a difference by making them feel seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exercising compassion as opposed to empathy, particularly in the face of helplessness is thought to be generally healthier for you - you might even come away feeling like you did something good - and better for the person in pain.</p>

			 <p>I recently had the pleasure of going to the <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/power">&ldquo;Power Up&rdquo; exhibition</a> in London&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</a> with a friend with whom I share a serious history of Mario <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart">Karting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Party">Partying</a>.</p>
<p>Power Up is a celebration of all things video-gaming. Or a very fully featured arcade dedicated to (mostly) home gaming systems.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got their hands on 160 consoles and PCs from over the past fifty years, video gaming of course being still a fairly young artform.</p>

<p>Each of them is set up with a pre-ordained game and sufficient controllers to relieve one&rsquo;s youthful gaming experiences, no matter when in calendar time your youth actually was.</p>
<p>This was the first time I ever got to play something akin to the original version of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a> - Atari&rsquo;s first video game and one of the earliest in general, having been first released in 1972.</p>

</p>
<p>The version on offer here was on the no-longer famous <a href="https://voxodyssey.com/binatone-tv-master-4-plus-2">Binatone TV Master 4 Plus 2 console</a> from 1977.  It has very sensitive weird dial-like controllers which move the bats up and down as you play a real basic but extremely difficult (for me) game of virtual tennis or one of the other 6 - yes six! - modes.</p>
<p>Fortunately the games were pre-loaded so one doesn&rsquo;t have to sit through 15 minutes of screeching tape noise in order to get to playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_World_Dizzy">Fantasy World Dizzy</a>, here on 1984&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464">Amstrad CPC 464</a>, complete with cassette tape drive. This, fellow kids, was from the era before 99p instant gratification app stores were a thing.</p>

Some of the more iconic franchises - Sonic, Mario - had their own sections allowing you to experience the character in question over time. Including surely one of the world&rsquo;s most perfect platformers ever, Super Mario World.</p>

<p>Note though that for the various versions of Mario Kart - playing the Gamecube&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart:_Double_Dash">Double Dash</a> was our personal highlight - you head to the multiplayer section.</p>
<p>For the slightly more modern, more hardcore, gamer with better reflexes than I can ever hope to have there&rsquo;s an ongoing 16 player Halo tournament. Wii bowling and one of the dance like no-one&rsquo;s watching style games are also available for those who prefer their action more physical. A big bank of PC games are also on show for those who prefer the non-console life, although I didn&rsquo;t really understand how to play most of them.</p>

<p>Freud believed that human behaviour is largely determined by unconscious motivations that originate in one&rsquo;s childhood. In particularly those that developed as a result of encounters with love, loss, sexuality or death. He developed a talking therapy that aimed to help patients understand and deal with any adverse impact that their resultant unconscious was having on their lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freud&rsquo;s theories paint a picture of human beings as internally conflicted, governed by unruly instinctual impulses rather than by reason, and generally lacking self-knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Famously, patients would lie on a couch whilst undergoing their analysis. The couch itself can be still be seen in the museum.</p>

<p>Until 1938 he lived and practiced his profession in Austria. But when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938 he found himself in grave danger. Being both Jewish and a radical thinker he was surely destined for a deadly fate had he not managed to successfully seek refuge in the UK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw the scientific society I had founded dissolved, our institutions destroyed, our printing press taken over by the invaders, the books I had published confiscated or reduced to pulp, and my children expelled from their professions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately his sisters were not so lucky in terms of getting out, with each of them succumbing to death in Nazi concentration camps.</p>
<p>But Sigmund made it to England in 1938. He lived only about one year more, dying in 1939. One of his daughters, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud">Anna Freud</a>, herself a practitioner of psychoanalysis who went on to develop the field of psychoanalytic child psychology, then resided there until her death in 1982.</p>
<p>It was Anna that set in motion the conversion of their last residence into a public museum, wherein now you can visit both the Freuds' treatment rooms in something akin to their original glory. Sigmund&rsquo;s love of antiquity is apparent with his various collections dotted around his office.</p>

			 <p>I always find it interesting to understand the thresholds involved in being in the various economic strata of UK residents.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/characteristics-and-incomes-top-1">This 2019 analysis from the IFS</a> that looks at the top 1% of British income tax payers finds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be included you&rsquo;d have needed a taxable income of £160k or more.</li>
<li>Given a substantial proportion of UK adults don&rsquo;t pay any income tax - 43% - the threshold would be £120k if you included them.</li>
<li>The top 1% are disproportionately male, middle-aged and based in London.</li>
<li>People enter and exit the top 1% regularly. A quarter of those who are in the top 1% of income tax payers one year are not there in the next.</li>
<li>That fluidity means that 3.4% of all people born in 1963 were in the top 1% sometime between 2000 and 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be said that given that the analysis using income tax records it probably misses out some of the wealthiest folk. Anyone who has wealth or sources of income not subject to income tax wouldn&rsquo;t be included. As would anyone who should be paying their income tax either in principle or in fact but has used the fleet of well-paid financial advisors available to the super-rich to evade their responsibilities for doing so.</p>
<p>Also the analysis is from 2019, so it seems very likely given the turbulent years between then and now that some of the numbers would have shifted since then.</p>

			 <p>An incredible <a href="https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/node/40768">1 in 50 Londoners</a> are homeless - and that&rsquo;s a figure from August last year so I wouldn&rsquo;t be amazed if it had increased.</p>
<p>It was also an underestimate of the true problem at the time as the figure <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-66387577">included only the roughly 170k people</a> for whom their council had managed to place them into some kind of emergency accommodation. So anyone who is sleeping rough or on their friend&rsquo;s couch isn&rsquo;t counted.</p>
<p>Lots of them are children. On average it&rsquo;d be like one child in every school classroom is homeless.</p>
<p>The driving factors are of course economic.</p>
<p>Councils, always dramatically underfunded in terms of what&rsquo;s needed to resolve this and so many other issues, are constantly breaking their legal obligations in this sphere. Most of them appear to feel that they have no other option.</p>
<p>Following the catastrophic sell-off of public housing in recent decades, lower income folk - and indeed local authorities - have been increasingly reliant on the private rental market. But this kind of housing supply in London has dropped dramatically. There&rsquo;s been <a href="https://beta.londoncouncils.gov.uk/news/2023/sharp-fall-private-rental-listings-means-londons-housing-pressures-going-bad-disastrous">a 41% reduction</a> in the number of properties available for rent since the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At the same time, Local Housing Allowance has been frozen since 2020. Rents have continued to increase - as have so many other prices as part of the current cost of living crisis. The LHA was previously sufficient to allow someone to rent the lowest cost 30% of rentals on the market. Last year a study showed that it&rsquo;d <a href="https://beta.londoncouncils.gov.uk/news/2023/sharp-fall-private-rental-listings-means-londons-housing-pressures-going-bad-disastrous">only cover the cheapest 2.3% of London listings</a> on Rightmove. This really doesn&rsquo;t work out well when across the UK even in 2022 <a href="https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/349453-0">over 10% of private renters</a> were reliant on LHA.</p>
<p>All this is of course we even consider the condition and suitability of some of this housing.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/12/31/the-lost-cause.html">The Lost Cause - an oddly hopeful story of a climate-change ravaged near future</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781035902248">The Lost Cause</a> by Cory Doctorow.</p>
<p>This book is set in California, three decades into the future. Climate change has continued to ravage the world. Large parts of the US have been rendered uninhabitable by floods, fires, pandemics et al. That naturally created a lot of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221117-how-borders-might-change-to-cope-with-climate-migration">internal climate change refugees</a>.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not entirely dystopian. It got so bad that the US government and its citizenry finally managed to muster up a response that actually sets out to mitigate the worst of the impact, although it required a fairly radical liberal president who brought in a Green New Deal (GND) and didn&rsquo;t mind ignoring the courts to do so. Who was unfortunately replaced with a rather less effective one by the time the book was set.</p>
<p>Much of the citizenry are also heavily engaged in building back better where it&rsquo;s still possible to do so. Carbon neutral factories, lots of clean energy and an enthusiasm for building safe and dense housing in places where it&rsquo;s possible to do so. A gig-like green jobs guarantee means that everyone who wants to work can do so, with plenty of training on hand, all in the cause of protecting humans and the environment. Refugees are generally welcomed and celebrated for the many benefits they bring to their new homes.</p>
<p>This anyway is the life of the protagonist, Brooks, who gets a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from helping humanity preserve itself and its environment. Lovely, if a little simplistic, and his late-teen dialogue grates a little at time. Maybe I’m just old.</p>
<p>But not everyone is a Brooks. There&rsquo;s still a mostly old-white-men vanguard who aren&rsquo;t in line with these new vibes - the MAGA club. These folk hate the GND, they hate the idea of refugees streaming into their historic homes, of welfare programs and so on. Some are into strange conspiracy theories or the weird ideas based around <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53654318">sovereign citizenship</a>. At first they didn&rsquo;t believe in climate change. Now they think it&rsquo;s too late to do anything about it so simply want to preserve what&rsquo;s left of their old way of life.</p>
<p>Separately there&rsquo;s also the crypto posse, a group of the mostly mega rich tech bro types who live their life on a giant boat. They’re only interested in big technological solutions to the catastrophe - seed the atmosphere, figure out how to go live on Mars - in between living the Bitcoin lifestyle where the freedom and well-being of money is more important than that of people, with the possible exception of the hallowed grindset innovator types.</p>
<p>All the stereotypes are there, although to be fair an overt effort is made now and then to not paint this as a simple battle between good and evil. In reality, people usually have reasons for their beliefs and actions that aren’t just ‘I want to be evil’.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the Magas didn&rsquo;t want to watch the world burn. They sincerely wanted to save it. They weren&rsquo;t wrong because they were cruel.</p>
<p>They were cruel because they were wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doctorow’s politics certainly shine through. If you’re a reader of <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">his blog</a> you will be familiar with some of the arguments implicitly presented in this book, often the case with his novels. It follows a long line of what might be called ‘activist fiction’ - if nothing else providing a much more accessible entrance to the relevant ideas to the uninitiated than a dry textbook would, and a vision of what might be possible to the already-sympathetic.</p>
<p>For earlier attempts on adjacent topics,
the Guardian provides <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/top-10-books-of-eco-fiction">a list of another 10 books</a> they term ‘eco-fiction’, going back as far as to 1962 for JG Ballard’s ‘<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780871403629?title=The+Drowned+World&amp;author=J.+G.+Ballard&amp;cover_id=133466">The Drowned World</a>’.</p>
<p>It might be unusual to come away from a story where central points include climate change ruining the world and people mistreating each other with positive feelings, but this one definitely gives a sense of hope. Ideas of what could be done to change the current trajectory of humankind, visions of a kinder, more effective, competent and empathetic society even whilst such a thing feels hard to imagine right now.
 
No doubt this is somewhat because my politics are quite similar to the author. It’s nice to imagine a world where the main arguments around climate change, refugees and the like have largely been settled in a progressive way. And furthermore where their implication have been practically implemented into everyday life giving people a sense of progress, of purpose, as they develop and use technology for motives other than rank financial profit.</p>
<p>Now it’s the remaining few disbelievers, those who don’t share certain ’progressive’ values, that are the oddbods, albeit often ones with still substantial access to power. Of course it’d be rather a shame if it takes the same catastrophic destruction of much of today’s world to get us to a similar place in reality.</p>

			 <p>Unsurprisingly, ChatGPT and its ilk are finding their way into providing direct customer service for some businesses. Equally as unsurprisingly it&rsquo;s easy enough to confuse them into providing responses that no human agent would.</p>

			 <p>(List last updated 2024-10-15, first written 2023-12-29)</p>
<p>Ever since the generative AI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> craze started - it&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/chatgpts-one-year-anniversary-how-the-viral-ai-chatbot-has-changed.html">just over a year since it launched </a>if you can believe that - I&rsquo;ve been looking for some nice meaty but lay-person-adjacent books to help me understand how best to think about the contemporary variant of artificial intelligence hype.</p>
<p>Not necessarily the technical details, the code underlying the seeming magic  - or at least not only those details. I&rsquo;m interested too in the more more philosophical, more political domains of thought. What will AI do to society? What might it improve, what might it make worse? How best should we consider and handle it to ensure it does more of the former than the latter? Or is it all a tech-bro mirage, nothing more than a technological flash in a pan?</p>
<p>Whilst the current instantiation of the newer large language model public demos are still new enough that there&rsquo;s likely not been enough time for a huge number of reliable comprehensive-but-approachable books to have been written, it&rsquo;s not like people weren&rsquo;t already thinking about AI from both technical and philosophical viewpoints way before OpenAI came to be.</p>
<p>The distinct field of what could be called &ldquo;AI studies&rdquo; has been around at least 60 years, depending on how you count it. I certainly was exposed to it at university quite some years ago. Alan Turing was considering whether machines could think <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/artificial-intelligence">back in 1950</a>.  And people&rsquo;s thoughts and dreams about aspects of future AIs have likely been around far longer - centuries longer -  as cultural artifacts and thought experiments, even if they use <a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/12/golems-as-artificial.html">very different terminology</a>. Undoubtedly there&rsquo;s plenty of very interesting and thoughtful work out there.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a few books that have piqued my interest, mostly culled from various articles or podcasts about AI I must have perused over the past few months. They&rsquo;re not exactly recommendations, as I haven&rsquo;t yet read them. But I hope to do so one day, and would welcome any other suggestions.</p>
<p>Before the most recent hype cycle I&rsquo;d already read a handful of works on AI. Three of the ones that I felt I got something useful out of were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a>, by Nick Bostrom</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53238793-life-3-0">Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a>, by Max Tegmark</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> by Cathy O&rsquo;Neil</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my basic fantasy to-read list, in no particular order:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56097578-god-human-animal-machine">God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning</a> by Meghan O&rsquo;Gieblyn</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A strikingly original exploration of what it might mean to be authentically human in the age of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>For most of human history the world was a magical and enchanted place ruled by forces beyond our understanding. The rise of science and Descartes’s division of mind from world made materialism our ruling paradigm, in the process asking whether our own consciousness—i.e., souls—might be illusions. Now the inexorable rise of technology, with artificial intelligences that surpass our comprehension and control, and the spread of digital metaphors for self-understanding, the core questions of existence—identity, knowledge, the very nature and purpose of life itself—urgently require rethinking.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50131136-atlas-of-ai">Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence</a>, by Kate Crawford:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hidden costs of artificial intelligence, from natural resources and labor to privacy, equality, and freedom</p>
<p>What happens when artificial intelligence saturates political life and depletes the planet? How is AI shaping our understanding of ourselves and our societies? In this book Kate Crawford reveals how this planetary network is fueling a shift toward undemocratic governance and increased racial, gender, and economic inequality. Drawing on more than a decade of research, award‑winning science, and technology, Crawford reveals how AI is a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers behind “automated” services, to the data AI collects from us.</p>
<p>Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms, Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong. While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity, they are always systems of power. This is an urgent account of what is at stake as technology companies use artificial intelligence to reshape the world.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60411384-why-machines-will-never-rule-the-world">Why Machines Will Never Rule the World: Artificial Intelligence without Fear</a>, by Jobst Landgrebe, Barry Smith:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book’s core argument is that an artificial intelligence that could equal or exceed human intelligence—sometimes called artificial general intelligence (AGI)—is for mathematical reasons impossible&hellip;</p>
<p>Landgrebe and Smith show how a widespread fear about AI’s potential to bring about radical changes in the nature of human beings and in the human social order is founded on an error. There is still, as they demonstrate in a final chapter, a great deal that AI can achieve which will benefit humanity. But these benefits will be achieved without the aid of systems that are more powerful than humans, which are as impossible as AI systems that are intrinsically &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or able to &ldquo;will&rdquo; a takeover of human society.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43999120">Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust</a>, by Gary F. Marcus and Ernest Davis:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a truly robust AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we are led to believe&hellip;The world we live in is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Marcus and Davis show us what we need to first accomplish before we get there and argue that if we are wise along the way, we won&rsquo;t need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we heed their advice, humanity can create an AI that we can trust in our homes, our cars, and our doctor&rsquo;s offices.</p>
<p>Reboot provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of what we can achieve and how AI can make our lives better.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/90590134">The Coming Wave; Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century&rsquo;s Greatest Dilemma</a> by Mustafa Suleyman.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An urgent warning of the unprecedented risks that AI and other fast-developing technologies pose to global order, and how we might contain them while we have the chance&hellip;</p>
<p>In The Coming Wave , Suleyman shows how these forces will create immense prosperity but also threaten the nation-state, the foundation of global order. As our fragile governments sleepwalk into disaster, we face an existential unprecedented harms on one side, the threat of overbearing surveillance on the other.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>This groundbreaking book from the ultimate AI insider establishes “the containment problem”—the task of maintaining control over powerful technologies—as the essential challenge of our age.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/139183078">The Eye of the Master: A Social History of Artificial Intelligence</a> by Matteo Pasquinelli.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is AI? A dominant view describes it as the quest &ldquo;to solve intelligence,&rdquo; a solution supposedly to be found in the secret logic of the mind or in the deep physiology of the brain, such as in its complex neural networks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Eye of the Master argues, to the contrary, that the inner code of AI is shaped not by the imitation of biological intelligence, but the intelligence of labour and social relations, as it is found in Babbage&rsquo;s &ldquo;calculating engines&rdquo; of the industrial age as well as in the recent algorithms for image recognition and surveillance.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The Eye of the Master urges a new literacy on AI for scientists, journalists and new generations of activists, who should recognise that the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of AI is just the automation of labour at the highest degree, not intelligence per se.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123249503-impromptu">Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI</a>, by Reid Hoffman</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI, written by Reid Hoffman with GPT-4, offers readers a travelog of the future – exploring how AI, and especially Large Language Models like GPT-4, can elevate humanity across key areas like education, business, and creativity</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>His conversation with AI takes us on a journey to the future, where AI is not a threat, but a partner&hellip;.How might humanity use GPT-4 to continue our long-standing quest to make life more meaningful and prosperous? How can we use it to help solve some of the hardest challenges we face? To expand opportunities for self-determination and self-expression? Along with solutions and opportunities, GPT-4 will also create its own challenges and uncertainties. Impromptu explores how we might address risk as we continue to develop AI technologies that can boost human progress at a time when the need for rapid solutions at scale has never been greater.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58772732-ways-of-being">Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence</a>, by James Bridle.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent years have seen rapid advances in &lsquo;artificial&rsquo; intelligence, which increasingly appears to be something stranger than we ever imagined. At the same time, we are becoming more aware of the other intelligences which have been with us all along, unrecognized. These other beings are the animals, plants, and natural systems that surround us, and are slowly revealing their complexity and knowledge - just as the new technologies we&rsquo;ve built are threatening to cause their extinction, and ours.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>From Greek oracles to octopuses, forests to satellites, Bridle tells a radical new story about ecology, technology and intelligence. We must, they argue, expand our definition of these terms to build a meaningful and free relationship with the non-human, one based on solidarity and cognitive diversity. We have so much to learn, and many worlds to gain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198283327-the-atomic-human">**The Atomic Human: Understanding Ourselves in the Age of AI</a>, by Neil D. Lawrence**.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does Artificial Intelligence mean for our identity? Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human intelligence. We believe it&rsquo;s what differentiates us. Fears of AI not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the centre of the world.&raquo;Neil D. Lawrence&rsquo;s visionary book shows why these fears may be misplaced.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>By contrasting our capabilities with machine intelligence, The Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just by the experts, but ordinary people. Understanding this will enable readers to choose the future we want – either one where AI is a tool for us, or where we become a tool of AI – and how to counteract the digital oligarchy to maintain the fabric of an open, fair and democratic society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Artificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI’s power grows, so does the need to figure out what—and who—this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; to serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199534421-the-skill-code">The Skill Code: How to Save Human Ability in an Age of Intelligent Machine</a>, by Matt Beane</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From one of the world’s top researchers on work and technology comes an insightful and surprising guide to protecting your skill in a world filling with AI and robots. Think of your most valuable skill, the thing you can reliably do under pressure to deliver results. How did you learn it? Whatever your job – plumber, attorney, teacher, surgeon – decades of research show that you achieved mastery by working with someone who knew more than you did. Formal learning—school and books—gave you conceptual knowledge, but you developed your skill by working with an expert. Today, this essential bond is under threat.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Whether you’re an expert or a novice, this book will show you how to build skill more effectively – and how to make intelligent technologies part of the solution, not the problem.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208707460-deep-utopia">Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World</a>, by Nick Bostrom</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bostrom’s previous book, Paths, Dangers, Strategies changed the global conversation on AI and became a New York Times bestseller. It focused on what might happen if AI development goes wrong. But what if things go right?</p>
<p>Suppose that we develop superintelligence safely, govern it well, and make good use of the cornucopian wealth and near magical technological powers that this technology can unlock. If this transition to the machine intelligence era goes well, human labor becomes obsolete. We would thus enter a condition of &ldquo;post-instrumentality&rdquo;, in which our efforts are not needed for any practical purpose. Furthermore, at technological maturity, human nature becomes entirely malleable.</p>
<p>Here we confront a challenge that is not technological but philosophical and spiritual. In such a solved world, what is the point of human existence? What gives meaning to life? What do we do all day?</p>

<p>To be fair, an absolutely mind-boggling number of papers get published each year these days. Those 10k papers are only equivalent to around 0.2% of papers that were published this year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>8000 of the papers were <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2023/12/19/hindawi-reveals-process-for-retracting-more-than-8000-paper-mill-articles/">all from the same publishing house</a>, Hindawi, an unwelcoming $35-40 million surprise for its recent owners, Wiley.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781524742874">Being You: A New Science of Consciousness</a> by Anil Seth.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This feels like a book that&rsquo;s going to be hard to summarise. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I read most of it a year and a half ago whilst on a sun lounger. But I also found it a fairly dense and complicated book. Although a tome on the subject of &ldquo;what is consciousness and how does it work?&rdquo; could hardly be anything else. A key aspect of the topic is after all colloquially known as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">the hard problem</a>&rdquo; - although Seth believes that particular aspect isn&rsquo;t the one that we should be trying to solve in the first place.</p>
<p>The famous &ldquo;<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a>&rdquo; is to figure out why the presumably physical inputs we receive from the external world lead to our inner phenomenological experiences. Why do we experience certain vibrations, in the form of sound waves, as music? Why does that experience of &ldquo;music&rdquo; make us feel things? Sad, happy, warm, awe-struck, or anything else on the wide-ranging human palette of feelings.</p>
<p>Why does this particular wavelength of light generate the experience of an intense red, and how come it makes us feel relaxed, or on edge? In summary: why does being exposed to physical phenomena make give us an &ldquo;experience&rdquo;? Both as a general question, and also, for a given single input why that experience in particular?</p>
<p>Seth thinks that&rsquo;s the wrong line of inquiry. He wants us to think about the &ldquo;real problem&rdquo;  of consciousness. By his telling, that means that the goal of science should be to explain, predict and control the phenomenological properties of consciousness. Or as he writes in <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one">an article for Aeon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;how to account for the various properties of consciousness in terms of biological mechanisms; without pretending it doesn’t exist (easy problem) and without worrying too much about explaining its existence in the first place (hard problem).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First up, his definition of consciousness. Here it&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;any kind of subjective experience&rdquo;. But, importantly, the experiences are indeed subjective.</p>
<p>We do not perceive things 1:1 as they are. This doesn&rsquo;t take too much introspection to figure out even without the aid of a complicated book. Seth describes our perception of reality as a &ldquo;controlled hallucination&rdquo;.  There are other types of hallucinations - LSD inspired ones for instance. But the shared hallucination that (almost) all of us agree on at a given point in time is the one that we choose to call reality.</p>
<p>We experience colours when what is actually out there is merely photons. We experience music when what is out there is merely vibrations. There surely is a &ldquo;truth&rdquo; out there, but we have no direct access to it. Rather, our brains create our conscious experience from its inputs. This explains why we can be predictably mistaken about things. Think for instance of visual illusions. The white &amp; gold / black &amp; blue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">dress that broke the Internet</a> a few years ago is an obvious example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;our perceptual experiences of the world are internal constructions, shaped by the idiosyncrasies of our personal biology and history</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why have we evolved to do this presumably computationally intense and certainly extremely unintuitive hard mental work? Because, of course, it helps us get through life.</p>
<p>The discomfort we feel when hungry is useful from a survival, and hence evolutionary, point of view. It motivates us to seek out food. Particularly energy dense food that in times gone past would have given us the most survival bang for our buck. The enticing taste of chocolate thus isn&rsquo;t some random weird intrinsic property of its constituent molecules. It serves a function. Our conscious experience of the deliciousness of it motivates us want to seek out and consume it. In that way we can replenish our energy stores, and stay alive.</p>
<p>Colours provide another useful example. The properties of the light reflected from the same object in dark surroundings compared to well-light surroundings can be dramatically different. The actual stuff that hits our eyeballs - the sensory information - is thus very dependent on our environment. But it suits the way we work in the world for us to understand that it&rsquo;s the same object. We still feel that the blue shirt that we previously saw in the midday sun is blue even when the actual sensory information we receive looking at it in the dusky evening is very different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We perceive the world not as it is, but as it is useful to us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The brain can be thought of as a prediction machine that takes the inputs it receives from our senses and produces a guess of what caused those inputs, of what is out there. This is necessary because knowing what is out there in our environment is a fundamental requirement for us to survive. With no way to access raw truth, our brain has evolved the ability to make educated guesses, or, to put it more formally, predictions. Our conscious sense of reality is essentially those predictions.</p>
<p>Our impression of reality is constantly updated as the brain receives further sensory input. The aim is to reduce prediction errors, likely via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian reasoning principles</a>.  Our inner &ldquo;reality&rdquo; thus shifts as we subconsciously receive input that is incompatible with our present perception of reality.</p>
<p>It increases in confidence when the stuff coming in through out sense organs is congruent with our prior beliefs. But, be honest, we&rsquo;re all familiar with having seen or heard something that later turned out to be entirely different from how we perceived it at the time. It&rsquo;s because what we perceive is nothing more than our best guess from incomplete information. It&rsquo;s impossible to guess right every time when you&rsquo;re not omniscient.</p>
<p>This mechanism can also lead to our many famous biases. The prediction machine side of things is why we&rsquo;re more likely to perceive things that we expect in advance to perceive; yet another phenomenon that makes clear the lack of objectivity in our conscious experience.</p>
<p>For those who follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle">active inference theory</a> it might be that the actions we &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to take in the world are those that will minimise our predictive errors. We take actions to confirm that our predictions are true, and when it turns out that they are not then we update our predictions.</p>
<p>There are plenty of potential implications of this telling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our sense of &ldquo;self&rdquo; is another of these controlled hallucinations, which, amongst other things, explains why it&rsquo;s so hard for philosophers to pin down. The self is a mix of our brain&rsquo;s predictions, beliefs and memories. This explains why people who suffer issues with memory can have their sense of self affected.</li>
<li>The same with free will. Even the most ardent free will skeptic might admit to having a sense that they have free will even if they objectively do not believe that can be the case. But it&rsquo;s another hallucination, &ldquo;designed&rdquo; to provoke us into behaviour that is to our evolutionary benefit. Even if in reality there was no real possibility that we would have done things differently in the past, the feeling that we could have done so provides a feeling that we&rsquo;re able to do things differently the next time if it suits our survival to do so. We can learn.</li>
<li>Our emotions don&rsquo;t cause our physical reactions. Rather it&rsquo;s the other way around. Our heart doesn&rsquo;t beat faster because we&rsquo;re scared. We consciously feel fear because our heart is beating faster, and the feeling of fear is a way to motivate us to actions that&rsquo;ll help us survive, such as running away.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads us to Seth&rsquo;s &ldquo;beast machine theory&rdquo;. For us to survive and thrive, it&rsquo;s important not only to be within a safe external environment, but also that certain interoceptive signals - those received based on our body temperature or heart rate for example - are maintained within certain value ranges.</p>
<p>If these inner indicators stray into more dangerous territory then the brain provides phenomenological hallucinations, more commonly described as emotions and moods, that provoke us to take actions to return the signals it&rsquo;s receiving back to a normal and safe value.  For us beast machines, regulating our inner-state and integrity is of a higher priority than accurately perceiving things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a social side of things too. We alter our behaviour based on our perception of what other people might be perceiving about us. Our identities often reflect what other people think of us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also capable of learning from and about other entities. And not only those from our own species; most people intuit that at least some animals might be conscious. And in the current AI-enthusiast times, some people wonder whether at some point machines might be too. Seth is skeptical of the latter, although doesn&rsquo;t entirely rule it out.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s important that we do try to figure the parameters of consciousness out - whether the potential experiencer is made of meat, silicon or something else - because as soon as something has consciousness then it gains a moral status such that we should take care to minimise its suffering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the entirety of human experience and mental life arises because of, and not in spite of, our nature as self-sustaining biological organisms that care about their own persistence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who prefer videos to books, the author has given a TED talk on the subject too.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Looking at the various dictionaries' Word Of The Year 2023 winners - let&rsquo;s hope no good words come out in the next 10 days hey? - I see they&rsquo;ve been almost as distracted as I have by the robot brains.</p>
<p><a href="https://content.dictionary.com/word-of-the-year-2023/">Dictionary.com</a> focuses on a key limiting factor of today&rsquo;s automated chatters: their ability to <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">answer you with fiction</a>, indistinguishable from fact in its presentation. They go with &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo;. Which isn&rsquo;t a new word of course, but OK, it was really only this year that journalists, commentators, and everyone of a certain type who you follow on social media started to write en masse about computers having them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(of artificial intelligence) to produce false information contrary to the intent of the user and present it as if true and factual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/editorial/woty">Cambridge</a> goes for something similar. In fact something exactly the same: &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s definition now includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an artificial intelligence hallucinates, it produces false information</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I love the way either definition is phrased, but they&rsquo;re the word experts I suppose.</p>
<p>Collins is on the same theme, but a bit more general. Their word of the year is &lsquo;AI&rsquo;. Which is actually an <em>abbreviation</em> for Artificial Intelligence, but no need to be picky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the modelling of human mental functions by computer programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have certainly successfully modelled the human mental function of not telling the truth, as confirmed twice above.</p>
<p><a href="https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2023/">Oxford</a> goes with something totally different, something for the youngsters: &lsquo;rizz&rsquo;. This word was new to me at least in 2023. Perhaps an abbreviation of charisma, it&rsquo;s a noun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>style, charm, or attractiveness, the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avid followers of bad things might remember a crossover technology featuring both rizz and the risk of hallucinations in the guise of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/18/somewhat-astonishing-that.html">rizzGPT</a>, which was to be a weird thing you put on your glasses that offers &ldquo;real-time Charisma as a Service (CaaS)&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year">Mirriam-Webster</a> goes with &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;. It has <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authentic">5 possible meanings</a> in their telling, none of which feel particularly new to this year. The first is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not false or imitation: real, actual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this choice feels a bit dated to me - didn&rsquo;t we go through a bout of authenticity a few years ago? -  maybe it&rsquo;s not so unrelated to the ones above; an antithesis to the other dictionaries' theses.</p>
<p>Mirriam-Webster thinks that the increase in interest of the definition of the word authentic is &ldquo;driven by stories and conversations about AI, celebrity culture, identity, and social media.&rdquo; - also known as conversations about hallucinations, AI and people trying to demonstrate their rizz.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1625455425">Stumpwork</a> by Dry Cleaning.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really know I needed someone sardonically reading out what appears to be their unfiltered thoughtstream deadpan over a background of various guitar-and-rhythm styles in my life but it turns out I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s oddly soothing. I guess knowing that other people have the same incessant, random, sort of dull monologue in their heads as they go about their day is reassuring. Kudos to these folks for making it into a real art form.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Everyone calls it post-punk, which I&rsquo;m not sure I fully know what means yet, but it&rsquo;s very good whatever it is. Think unrefined poetry being read out by someone who doesn&rsquo;t really care about it, but again, good.</p>
<p>Their first album, <a href="https://album.link/i/1549505079">New Long Leg</a>, also recommended, brought to my mind the idea of someone reading out their Facebook timeline, unfiltered, end-to-end, at times. This one feels more about over-sharing the constant array of often meaningless things that pop into one&rsquo;s mind in between a bit of tedious small-talk with neighbours. But again, in a very good way.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982155292">Zero Days</a> by Ruth Ware.</p>
<p>The book opens with Jacintha Cross sneaking around a corporate office, seemingly conducting some kind of heist. It turns out she&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration tester</a> so even if things did go wrong the consequences wouldn&rsquo;t be all that bad. Except today, when Gabe - her partner in both life and business - ends up in some real dire straits. And most people, the police included, seem to think she&rsquo;s to blame.</p>
<p>This felt like a fairly standard thriller, but its themes of hacking, social engineering and the like appeal to me, so I was fairly into it. There were some twists and turns to get excited about, although, despite not normally being great at doing, so I felt like I could see many of them coming substantially in advance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless it was compulsive enough to definitely need reading right to the end. Plus I felt like I learned a couple of techniques for confusing people into letting me into places I shouldn&rsquo;t really be in that, who knows, might come in handy one day.</p>

			 <p>The last of the big tech giants recently released its version of a large language model generative AI assistant - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/">Amazon&rsquo;s somewhat dystopia-sounding &ldquo;Q&rdquo;</a>. Not to be confused with OpenAI&rsquo;s supposed-to-be-secret super powerful AI model <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-project-q-sam-altman-ia-model-explainer-2023-11">codename Q*</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon Q is aimed at businesses, especially those that already use Amazon technology as part of their operations, rather than entertaining your desires to hear robot-generated fan-fic. Perhaps more of a rival to <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/">Microsoft Copilot</a> than <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>.</p>
<p>By connecting it up to your existing data sources:</p>

<p>Business users—like marketers, project and program managers, and sales representatives, among others—can have tailored conversations, solve problems, generate content, take actions, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhat predictably, just 3 days later <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/amazons-q-has-severe-hallucinations">it hit the news</a> due to leaked documents suggesting that it is &ldquo;experiencing severe hallucinations and leaking confidential data&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Being an data analyst type of person I am a fervent believer in the below concept, but until now I didn&rsquo;t realise it had a name.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyman%27s_law">Wikipedia</a>, Twyman&rsquo;s law states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any figure that looks interesting or different is usually wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say if you think you found something mind-blowingly interesting or revolutionary in your data, the sad truth is that most often you just made some kind of mistake. Whilst we should of course approach each situation with an open mind, the same default principle might be adopted when reviewing the work of others.</p>

<p>Rolling Stone isn&rsquo;t holding back in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/henry-kissinger-war-criminal-dead-1234804748/">their obituary</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Kissenger</a>, who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/henry-kissinger-dominant-us-diplomat-cold-war-era-dies-aged-100-2023-11-30/">died last week</a> at the age of 100.</p>
<p>As US national security advisor and secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Rolling Stone tells a story which situates the responsibility for the deaths of millions of people on Kissenger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always valuable to hear the reverent tones with which American elites speak of their monsters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One major part of this was his role in deliberately undermining the potential for an earlier agreement to finish the catastrophic Vietnam war, seemingly on the basis that it might make it harder for his preferred candidate to win the US presidency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single person who died in Vietnam between autumn 1968 and the Fall of Saigon — and all who died in Laos and Cambodia, where Nixon and Kissinger secretly expanded the war within months of taking office, as well as all who died in the aftermath, like the Cambodian genocide their destabilization set into motion — died because of Henry Kissinger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For it seems like power was Kissenger&rsquo;s primary motivation. Power for himself, for his President, and for America, at any cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point was American geopolitical dominance, something measured in impunity and achieved by any means necessary.</p>

<p>The world is on track for a “hellish” 3C of global heating, the UN has warned.</p>

<p>Apparently our current efforts to combat global warming have us on track for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/20/world-facing-hellish-3c-of-climate-heating-un-warns-before-cop28">3 degree increase in global warming</a> by the end of the century.</p>
<p>I feel like the news is always the same, only the number of degrees increases point by point, in a very unreassuring manner. Which is fair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to assume next year&rsquo;s report lets us know that we&rsquo;re en-route to 3.5 degrees, and finds an adjective somehow even more unnerving than &ldquo;hellish&rdquo; to some up our future lives. Even achieving net zero by 2050 would still result in a 2 degree increase, a scenario that was described in rather doomy terms <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ipcc-climate-change-report-why-2-degree-warming-is-dangerous-2018-10">just a few years ago</a>.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781761261695">Upgrade</a> by Blake Crouch.</p>
<p>I read and enjoyed &ldquo;Recursion&rdquo; by the same author <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/02/finished-reading-recursion.html">earlier this year</a>, so was enthusiastic to try this, his latest novel, out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s set in a somewhat dystopian but very recognisable world of the presumably near future. We haven&rsquo;t solved our environmental problems, in fact parts of Manhattan are unusably flooded amongst other such places.  But technology has advanced a bit, in particular our ability to edit genes.</p>
<p>Although gene editing was outlawed following a misguided attempt by top scientist Miriam Ramsay to enhance the resistance of rice to a particular blight. Best of intentions maybe, but there were of course unforeseen consequences which led to a mass starvation, hundreds of millions of deaths, and a ban on genetic engineering. Miriam killed herself.</p>
<p>The ban is enforced by the Genetic Protection Agency, where we find out protagonist, Logan Ramsay, working. Logan is Miriam&rsquo;s son, who seems to be working there more out of a sense of guilt for the impact his mother had on the world - he himself was involved enough to go to prison for a while - than a love for the job.</p>
<p>One day, a raid goes wrong and he&rsquo;s exposed to an unknown virus. The symptoms are agonising at first, but he recovers his health soon enough. And more besides. Suddenly he feels stronger, more intelligent, more sensitive, with a better memory. He can even beat his daughter at chess. Until, imprisoned for genetic self-engineering, he no longer has the opportunity to.</p>
<p>Then a figure from his past life turns up, also stronger, fitter and cleverer than either of them had suspected. The problem is that they strongly disagree what they should do about it. The potential consequences of the decision could hardly be higher.</p>
<p>To get to the bottom of that requires resolving several deep ethical problems. What risks do we have the right to take in the name of a potentially better future? And even what does it mean to be human? Not that you&rsquo;ll need an ethics PhD to understand the situation, honestly it&rsquo;s mostly an action thriller, substantially less intellectually demanding to me than the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/11/27/everyone-was-right.html">last work of fiction I read</a> was. But the conundrum is real, and adjacent to one that humanity <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30742774">is already facing</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yet sure how I felt about the end of the epilogue, but was fully engrossed throughout the main story.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780544947665">The Extended Mind</a> by Annie Murphy Paul.</p>
<p>This was one of those books that are so fascinating that when I attempt to highlight the interesting bits I find myself highlighting the whole book. I&rsquo;d heard good things about it and it certainly delivered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on a topic that&rsquo;s of great import and interest to me - essentially how to think &ldquo;better&rdquo;. It also share a thesis that wasn&rsquo;t entirely intuitive to me in a way that suggests some practical avenues one can easily change one&rsquo;s behaviour in order to improve the output of your cognition. What more could be asked?</p>
<p>The general idea is that our society has fixated far too much on the idea that the individual brain is the sole locus of thinking, of cognition, of creativity and problem solving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;brain as computer model&rdquo;, as though we each have a self-contained isolated CPU in our heads that performs our thinking at whatever speed and quality nature saw fit to bestow upon us. That would suggest that aside from sitting at a desk an individually focusing on formal education and training courses, perhaps we could improve our brain&rsquo;s performance by learning new ways to think about things within our brain, some lifehacks, engaging in brain training or supplementation, but that&rsquo;s about it. Intelligence is a &ldquo;fixed lump of something in our heads&rdquo;, and we design our home, schools and workplaces around that idea</p>
<p>But the author contends that this is all wrong. Modern research has shown that the brain should be thought of more as a magpie. It creates its output out of the materials it finds around it. Thinking uses resources external to the brain, and the nature of the materials available affects the quality of the thinking. Intelligence, as properly considered, isn&rsquo;t fixed, but rather a &ldquo;shifting state&rdquo; that depends on the level of access you have to resources outside of your brain and your ability to leverage them. This book gives you the knowledge to try and improve both of those for yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>And this is essential work! Modern day life involves absorbing a ton of information, often in abstract forms that we had no reason to evolve to be good at, so we aren&rsquo;t. Many of the challenges and tasks that face us are extremely complex.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t for nothing that the amount of journal papers and patent applications that have a single author is dwindling over time. At some point much &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; work may have exceeded the natural capability of almost anyone&rsquo;s individual brain, no matter how ensconced in an ivory tower it is.</p>
<p>The book is grouped into three main sections, each of which deals with a different sphere in which we can consider extending our mind.</p>
<p>The first is using our bodies, rather than our brains to help us think. We are more than brains on a stick. The second is adapting the environments we reside  in to enable improved thinking. In some ways  the trend in recent times has been to engineer ever worse environments for thinking as time goes on. And the last is to leverage our social natures, to &ldquo;think&rdquo; with our relationships to other people. Groups of people can be more than the sum of their individuals, particularly if proactively designed to work as such.</p>
<p>The argument is that at present we&rsquo;d be much better served in spending time figuring out how to improve our capabilities in using these external resources than undergoing individual training to improve some personal skill.</p>
<p>Three sets of general principles arise. The first concerns the &ldquo;habits of mind&rdquo; that we should adopt to improve the output of our thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offload information from your brain whenever you can. This could mean anything from writing down your thoughts or &ldquo;socially offloading&rdquo; them to other people.</li>
<li>Transform information into artefacts, ideally physical ones. Interact with them, tweak them, show them to other people.</li>
<li>Be proactive in altering your inner state. Take some physical exercise before trying to learn something. Synchronise with others before you attempt group work. Spend time in nature if you have an upcoming creative task.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second set of principles uses our understanding of what the brain evolved to do in order to grasp how mental extension works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim to &ldquo;re-embody&rdquo; information. Allow your body&rsquo;s interoceptive signals to influence your choices. Use physical movement to enact concepts. Focus on your gestures and those of others.</li>
<li>Re-spatialise information when possible. Our brain processes information via mental maps. Use memory palaces, concept maps and the like to leverage that evolved capacity.</li>
<li>Re-socialise information. We process it better when we involved others. Teach others what you know, learn from them, imitate, argue, debate and tell each other stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly we have a set of principles based on &ldquo;what kind of creatures we are&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberately create cognitive loops. Use your body to help you think, then spatialise the information, then run it through the brains of other people. Keep looping it through each realm, again and again.</li>
<li>Create &ldquo;cognitively congenial situations&rdquo;. Issuing orders to your brain is a strategy often destined to fail. Instead, create environments that draw out the desired result of your thinking. Explain things to your peers, share stories, create a meaningful private space, walk in nature. What you do should depend on your cognitive goal.</li>
<li>Embed extensions in your day-to-day environment. This can range from arranging &ldquo;identity cues&rdquo; in your workspace through to deliberately cultivating a transactive memory system with your colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the main takeaway is that the best thinking does not generally occur when you are sat still on your own in a bland, neutrally-lit grey office of the sort often designed to aid thinking via being &ldquo;distraction-free&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But other people, other environments, other ways of being, your feelings and emotions are not always distractions to good thought. Far from it. Often thoughtfully seeking them out and leveraging them to extend our minds can produce far better thinking outputs, much more suited to the modern world, than the environments we&rsquo;ve historically designed.</p>
<p>The title of the book seems to be a shout-out to Clark and Chalmers' paper &ldquo;<a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1">The Extended Mind</a>&rdquo;, which is referred to in the text. In that they argue in a somewhat similar vein for the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis">extended mind thesis</a>&rdquo; - namely that the mind isn&rsquo;t limited to our brains, or even our bodies.  Rather that external items in the physical world - a diary, a computer - can be considered as part of the cognitive process and as such as extension of the mind.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1694386825">GUTS</a> by Olivia Rodrigo.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite childhood High School Musical character to present-day singing a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55679805">wildly popular song</a> about getting a driving license artist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, is back with a new(ish) album in 2023.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at least as good as her first one. There&rsquo;s a variety of styles on show, plenty of pop-punk , with some big piano ballads and a smattering of rap. Much of it riddled with the self-doubt, insecurity, anger and clever disses about idiot men that seem to be part of a lot of the newer music I chance upon these days. Sign of the times I guess.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1560735414">first album</a> was also pretty great but <a href="https://www.popdust.com/olivia-rodrigo-sour-stillbreaks-records-2657796279.html">everyone&rsquo;s already heard it</a> so you probably already knew that.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784971540">The Three-Body Problem</a> by Cixin Liu.
I remember this book got pretty rave reviews when it was published in English (and probably before - but I can only read English). Obama <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/transcript-president-obama-on-what-books-mean-to-him.html">liked it</a>. <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2015/05/03/reading-for-hugos/">George R. R. Martin</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/12/davos-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-what-to-read">Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg</a>too. But don&rsquo;t let that put you off, plenty of people with less wealth and, depending on your point of view, megalomaniac desires like it too. It also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/23/no-award-hugo-awards-following-controversy">won a Hugo Award</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>I left it some time, trying to wait until I felt like I&rsquo;d the opportunity to really dedicate time and focus to appreciating it fully. Naturally that time never came, but thankfully I gave it a go anyway. And, predictably, also loved it.</p>
<p>The subject matter is pretty attuned to my interests. We start with 1960s Chinese politics, in the midst of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>. Our protagonist is unfortunate enough to watch her father die in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session">struggle session</a>. She herself is arrested for suspicion of not being a good enough Communist. The prospective penalties are severe.</p>
<p>By the end we&rsquo;ve worked our way through alien civilisations, conspiracies, detectives, spies and, metaversey-stuff, with some nice doses of science and philosophy. Inexplicable phenomena abound; why are a bunch of scientists killing themselves? What condition is causing someone to see numbers wherever he looks? What actually is the purpose of the strange military installation? Or the VR game that seems to have appeared out of nowhere?</p>
<p>But what always fascinates me most of all are authors’ ideas about the weird ways that human society might react when very important, very unprecedented, situations occur. Some of the ones herein might seem unlikely at first, but then again very little can be more wild that the IRL emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon">the QAnon cult</a> and its troubling downstream effects. Would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory">Pizzagate</a> sound realistic had it only appeared in a sci-fi novel?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re told that so far “the entire history of humanity has been fortunate” - hard as that is to believe in current times - but sure, perhaps there’s a way in which that’s true in comparison to what is on the agenda here.</p>
<p>The book is not difficult to read despite the depth of the intellectual topics. It’s full of big, awesome, imaginative, and occasionally explicitly philosophical ideas that consumed my brain for a while. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll stick in my mind for a good long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first book of a trilogy.  There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m not going to read the others at some point after both the enjoyment this one brought and the way that it ended.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)">TV show version</a> of it expected to come to Netflix next year.</p>

			 <p>Remember the halcyon days of circa 2019, when OpenAI were <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/openai-gpt2-text-generating-algorithm-ai-dangerous.html">too nervous</a> to release GPT-2, yes, two, on an unsuspecting world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;OpenAI said that it would only be publishing a &ldquo;much smaller version&rdquo; of the model due to concerns that it could be abused. The blog post fretted that it could be used to generate false news articles, impersonate people online, and generally flood the internet with spam and vitriol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot changed in a few years.</p>
<p>2 generations of GPT later and now <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">anyone who has $10 to spare</a> can access the latest greatest GPT-4 - which has recently learned to &lsquo;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak">see, hear and speak</a>&rsquo; in-between its only-increasing potential to &lsquo;flood the internet with spam&rsquo; and &lsquo;generate false news articles&rsquo;, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/2/23707788/ai-spam-content-farm-misinformation-reports-newsguard">it is indeed doing</a> to at least some extent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s necessarily a bad thing. Well, except the spam and fake news parts - these days there exist several extremely low effort websites that have leveraged it for exactly that purpose. After all, rich companies hoarding rare resources is rarely the most obviously optimal way to benefit humanity as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some in the machine learning community have accused OpenAI of exaggerating the risks of its algorithm for media attention and depriving academics, who may not have the resources to build such a model themselves, the opportunity to conduct research with GPT-2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps slightly Ironically, they seemed a lot more about putting the Open into OpenAI back in those days, philosophically at least. What as far as I know is their original manifesto is <a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">still there on their site</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hoping to grow OpenAI into such an institution. As a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we have proprietary secrets - &lsquo;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ak3w5a/openais-gpt-4-is-closed-source-and-shrouded-in-secrecy">OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4 Is Closed Source and Shrouded in Secrecy</a>&rsquo; says Motherboard - as well as exclusive deals with anyone who has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-15/how-chatgpt-openai-made-microsoft-an-ai-tech-giant-big-take">a few billion dollars</a> to throw their way.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781118530801">The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling</a> by Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross.</p>
<p>Most everyone that&rsquo;s been in charge of designing a large database has recommended this to me as a good summary of how to think about the structure a data warehouse.</p>
<p>It teaches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimball_lifecycle">the Kimball method</a> - you might notice that&rsquo;s one of the authors' surnames. So if you&rsquo;ve come across terminology such as &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension">type 2 slowly changing dimension</a>&rsquo; or the facts and dimensions used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_fact_model">dimensional modelling</a> et al. then it&rsquo;s very possible that your interlocutor has read this tome.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m more an analyst than an engineer, I have dabbled in the latter and this book will be good guidance on how to think things through going forward.</p>
<p>A key aspect, and one I&rsquo;m grateful for, is to focus on making the data easy to understand and analyse in downstream tools, even if it requires substantially more effort - both technical and diplomatic - up front.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been helpful to me to understand why systems I use are set up like they are - e.g. a distinct absence of using null value where I&rsquo;d initially thought it&rsquo;d make sense to use them. It&rsquo;s also a refresher on basic patterns one can use to enable common analysis requirements like &lsquo;how many times has this value changed over time?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what would the results look like if they were remapped to the historical structure of the organisation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written rather prescriptively - follow this rule or regret it forever! I have been told by practitioners that sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary, or at least preferable, to break the occasional rule in reality but that their recommendations are good ones for the majority of the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also organised slightly confusingly in that most of it is divided up into chapters seemingly aimed at various specific business applications e.g. e-commerce or insurance. But they&rsquo;re at pains to say that you shouldn&rsquo;t just read the one that&rsquo;s most similar to your organisation or the task you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish as you&rsquo;ll not understand it fully without all the context provided in the earlier chapters that from their title don&rsquo;t seem relevant to you. So I&rsquo;m not entirely certain why they structured it like that in the first place.</p>
<p>But that aside, it&rsquo;s invaluable reading for anyone designing databases or using other people&rsquo;s databases that are designed this way.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Remember when the Conservatives thought they were <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/we-are-coming-after-you-home-secretary-priti-patel-to-warn-criminals-11824598">the party of law and order</a>? Hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not thinking here of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partygate">numerous illegal cringe-parties</a> the government and its associates held during the Covid-lockdown. Although do watch the <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/partygate">docu-drama &ldquo;Partygate&rdquo;</a> if you want to increase your level of annoyance at their doings even beyond whatever it currently is. But here I&rsquo;m thinking about rather more structural stuff.</p>
<p>Like how our former Home Secretary tried to coerce the police to ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/12/suella-braverman-calls-for-further-action-against-pro-palestine-marches">certain peaceful protests</a> on the topic of Palestine. The police said no, mainly on the basis that <a href="https://news.met.police.uk/news/met-will-do-everything-it-can-to-prevent-disruption-to-remembrance-events-474935">there is no law that would let them do so</a> despite her suggestion that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/people-supporting-hamas-in-uk-will-be-held-to-account-says-rishi-sunak">waving a national flag might be illegal</a> - obviously <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/politics-explained/union-jack-flag-boris-johnson-b1822389.html">Union Jacks would be exempt</a>. She wasn&rsquo;t at all embarrassed, but rather wrote <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pro-palestine-protest-london-met-police-cbqnxbtv3">a rant basically about how the police are too woke</a> in a national newspaper which, thankfully, eventually, at least in part, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/13/suella-braverman-sacked-home-secretary">got her fired</a>.</p>
<p>It comes to quite something when we have to rely on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/31/police-chiefs-blame-tory-cuts-for-fall-in-detection-and-charge-rates">shattered remnants</a> of the British police of all organisations - a large contingent of which have recently been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-misogynistic-homophobic-louise-casey-report">officially determined</a> to be &ldquo;institutionally racist, misogynistic and homophobic&rdquo; and seemingly <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/08/09/less-than-of.html">pretty terrible</a> at actually solving crime -  to be the last desperate hope against an illegal trampling of our civil liberties, to be the &ldquo;woke&rdquo; ones. But credit where credit&rsquo;s due, I applaud their actions in preventing a crime taking place in this case.</p>
<p>Now the courts ruled that the obviously illegal plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-61782866">ship off applicants for asylum</a> to other countries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/supreme-court-rejects-rishi-sunak-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda">was indeed illegal</a>. Despite the fact that it seems very plausible that his latest Home Secretary <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/james-cleverly-rwanda-scheme-batshit-sunak-b2448446.html">described the plan as &ldquo;batshit&rdquo;</a> in the past,  Sunak once again isn&rsquo;t embarrassed. Instead he&rsquo;s trying to find some way to get through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/15/rishi-sunak-to-bring-in-emergency-law-after-courts-rwanda-ruling">dubious new legislation</a> that &ldquo;allows&rdquo; him to ignore the court&rsquo;s decision, or pander to the worst of his party&rsquo;s instincts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/05/tory-mps-to-push-for-uk-exit-from-european-convention-of-human-rights">exit the ECHR</a>, as well as presumably any other legislation that has a chance of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html">protecting the outgroup, of binding the ingroup</a>.</p>
<p>What some of his party say is up there in terms of incitement to the famously irresponsible &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemies_of_the_People_(headline)">Enemies of the People</a>&rdquo; Daily Mail front page a while back. The police believe that Braverman&rsquo;s comments on the protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/12/police-say-suella-bravermans-claims-of-forces-bias-a-factor-in-attacks-on-them">were an important driving factor</a> in the violent attacks that far-right protesters -  note that this was a group that she <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> trying to ban - went on to perpetuate against them.</p>
<p>Further back of course there was all the Brexit stuff. Boris Johnson tried to pro-rogue Parliament to avoid mere democracy getting in the way of whatever his favourite idea of the time was at the time. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue">was deemed to have been illegal</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, when the quagmire of the Brexit they&rsquo;d &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; continued to become ever more apparent, some of the Conservative party - including their leader - decided that they&rsquo;d unilaterally invent some nice new legislation so that they could ignore the deal they&rsquo;d already signed up to regarding trade with Northern Ireland. Even their own ex-leader, Theresa May, said the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill was <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/06/27/senior-conservatives-denounce-protocol-bill-as-illegal-under-international-law/">illegal under international law</a>.</p>
<p>There was a time when they also claimed to be the good at the economy. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/08908266-cc47-4cda-b8d4-97a8ac433a6d">Haha</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a finding that may not surprise anyone who endures reading this blog, a recent study found that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/humans-will-trade-pain-useless-information">Humans will trade pain for useless information</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The useless information in question was the implications of the results of a coin-flip. Participants would get a reward based on the result of  a series of coin-flips. But by default they weren&rsquo;t told what exactly the prizes associated with heads or tails were until after the fact. Importantly, it was set up to ensure that the participants knew that they would receive the exact same reward irrespective of whether or not they knew the values of each side in beforehand.</p>
<p>Participants were then offered the chance to know what the reward associated with each side of the coin was in advance, but at the cost of having pain inflicted on them - a &ldquo;flash of heat&rdquo; applied to their arm. When the pain was set to low, about 3/4 of participants requested to receive the pain and learn in advance about the rewards, information which has no obvious utility given the setup. Even when the pain was set to maximum participants would choose to undergo it nearly half the time.</p>
<p>One theory the researchers have as to why this occurs is that as humans we&rsquo;re just generally deeply uncomfortable with uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This willingness to endure pain in exchange for noninstrumental information may stem from a deep-seated aversion to uncertainty, Bode says—to the point that some people are willing to go through physical discomfort for a few scraps of solid information. “Not knowing is really painful,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted in the original article, pain isn&rsquo;t the only adversity we&rsquo;re willing to go through in order to learn about something we know can have no effect on or bearing to what happens to us. Previous studies have shown that people are prepared to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005020">pay money</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02850-3">put in unnecessary physical effort</a> in order to learn in advance how a lottery would pay out in a way that could not possibly affect how much they&rsquo;d win.</p>

			 <p>Never trust a social network you don&rsquo;t own, lesson number 999.</p>
<p>After a period of disuse, Facebook has permanently locked me out of my account for something I definitely didn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Some time ago - I guess a long time ago - I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/214376678584711">deactivated my Facebook account</a>. I haven&rsquo;t really missed it all that much. Anyway, yesterday I decided to reactivate it so as to download all the photos I&rsquo;ve ever uploaded to it for safe storage, along with any that I&rsquo;m tagged in that I might like to revisit one day.  The latter isn&rsquo;t a native functionality as far as I&rsquo;m aware but browser extensions <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagged-photo-exporter-for/cicalpgkgmacgnbnnkhdgpnicipnihgo">like this one</a> purport to enable it.</p>
<p>This should of course be easy. From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/214376678584711">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to come back to Facebook after you&rsquo;ve deactivated your account, you can reactivate your account at any time by logging back in to Facebook or by using your Facebook account to log in somewhere else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, upon logging in to reactivate the account I was met with this message:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My account has apparently been permanently disabled for contravening their spam policy. And because it had been over 180 days since they decided to do that - which I had seemingly no way of knowing had happened given my account was temporarily deactivated - there is no way to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Obviously I haven&rsquo;t been spamming anyone given I deactivated the account but there we go.</p>
<p>At the very least, given I&rsquo;d explicitly suspended my account so wasn&rsquo;t logging in, I&rsquo;d have expected to have received some kind of robotically generated email to let me know of the supposed spam crime within the 6 months window that would have allowed me to appeal if I cared enough.</p>
<p>The good news is that it was still possible to export my content; that&rsquo;s the 1 button that&rsquo;s still available even with the block. Although, it comes to you in a single big intricate zip file that may take some time to dig through. But if I had a desire to start using my Facebook account again - something that temporarily deactivating your account is explicitly supposed to allow - then that opportunity is gone.</p>
<p>As is my social graph of course. The photos are in the zip somewhere, along with a pretty useless list of all the comments I ever made stripped of context - who knows what it was that I loved so much 7 years ago!? But the connections between me and my friends are gone. I&rsquo;m not aware of any social network you could upload that kind of data to even if your friends all agreed to sign up to it. Mainstream social networks are silos.</p>
<p>Also naturally it only exports the content I uploaded. So photos by me; but not the photos <em>of</em>  me that someone else uploaded, tagged me and shared that I&rsquo;d probably have liked to keep, let alone photos of friends or family, old or new.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t all that terrible from my personal point of view. I&rsquo;ve little interest in using Facebook and I probably have better-quality backups of most of the photos. But some people might fairly be quite annoyed or upset in this situation.</p>
<p>As always the lesson to take away is that if you ever post anything to a social network you might ever care about, always keep a copy of it safe somewhere you control. And if you value your social graph, well, I&rsquo;m not sure that there is a solution other than being sure to have some other way to contact your nearest and dearest.</p>
<p>Similarly with your interactions; the to-and-from flow of any meaningful conversations you had or any threads that meant a lot to you. You’ll be able to export your ramblings, but without the context of what you were responding to. We all know how annoying hearing only half a telephone conversation is. Again given the private and proprietary nature of the service, it&rsquo;s hard to know how you can personally mitigate this. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to act like it&rsquo;s 1997 and start printing out everything you found fun on Facebook?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously an outlier because I haven&rsquo;t been using my account for a long time. But other people find themselves unable to access their Facebook accounts for all sorts of reasons in ways that are much more upsetting to them. There are endless discussions online about it, Reddit is a good place to start if you want to find examples.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this phenomenon <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60959811">making national news</a> last year - I assume it&rsquo;s not an April fool despite the publication date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;despite not being an avid user, finding her account locked was still upsetting: &ldquo;All of the images from my university years and family occasions are on Facebook</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will no longer have access to 15-plus years of content, which is genuinely sad</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also quite stressful not knowing what the issue is, and having no recourse to resolve it. To be given no warning and then no way to access our own data is mindboggling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course no-one has a legal right to have a Facebook account. It&rsquo;s a private company entitled to make its own decisions outside of basic legal requirements. Personally I think a lot of people might be better off without an account. But, believe it or not, Facebook truly is a positive experience for some people. And its sheer size and scope creates a kind of monopolisation such that as much as you&rsquo;re able to &ldquo;export your data&rdquo; - which is certainly a good and important thing - there is often little of use that the average person can do with that data.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply replicate everything you&rsquo;d made the effort to create in Facebook at home or in a competitor&rsquo;s site. Even if you could, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force the people and organisations you want to talk to to move over to someplace new, which is what you&rsquo;d have to do considering Facebook is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network">federated social network</a>.</p>
<p>Being locked out forever would be especially upsetting for those people for Facebook is where their community is, whether this is how their family prefers  communicate, where the organisations they have to deal with post or where their support groups are. Innumerable organisations - everything from book clubs to government agencies to medical services to advocacy groups and beyond - seem to have chosen Facebook or one of its equally siloed competitors as a primary place to communicate to their members. It&rsquo;s a risky thing to do when you do not have the final say as to who is able to participate.</p>

<p>Meet Dr. John Watson, an army medic who had to leave military life after suffering an unfortunate field injury. He ends up joining the seemingly infinite hordes of folk who are trying to scrape a living together via becoming podcasters. Specifically in his case a true crime podcast.</p>
<p>Sure enough, soon a mutual friend introduces him to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>. Holmes is bit of an odd-bod in the social realm but has uncanny powers of observation. They end up renting a flat from Mariana, who works for Hudsons estate agent. And suddenly Watson has a lot of stuff to podcast about.</p>
<p>These are the tales of Sherlock Holmes, each one acted out in radio play format, retold as though from the modern era. Gone are the letters of inquiry from Dukes. Instead we hear of the Insta posts from cringey male-feminist influencer wannabes.

<p>Inevitably a problematic black market has formed. The UK health agency, MHRA, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-warns-of-unsafe-fake-weight-loss-pens">warns us</a> of the existence of at least hundreds of vials of entirely fake medication.</p>
<p>Some of the syringes being sold as containing semaglutide (Ozempic) or liraglutide (Saxenda) <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/26/health/british-health-agency-warns-of-fake-ozempic-pens-linked-to-hospitalizations/index.html">in fact contain insulin</a>.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780679640035">Crime and Punishment</a> by Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>This is the book that has been acclaimed by some as the one of the first ever psychological thrillers, but I feel has also gathered a somewhat off-putting reputation as being difficult to read.  Which I don&rsquo;t think is deserved at all, at least not the translation I read. If you have any interest in it, be bold, give it a go.</p>
<p>We follow the life of young Rodion Raskolnikov, who lives a life of seemingly at least somewhat self-chosen poverty in Moscow. He&rsquo;s something of an over-thinker, a philosopher of some kind. And so we find him pondering on whether or not he would be justified in murdering a mean old pawn-broker who has been less than generous to him and others in times of need in order to steal her money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no spoiler to say that between deciding that her life is immoral and overdosing on the writings of Hegel et al to the extent of considering himself as a candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">Great Man of History</a> he manages to convince himself that it&rsquo;s a reasonable, and perhaps even moral, thing to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all goes down near the start of the novel. It doesn&rsquo;t go quite to plan of course.</p>
<p>In what follows we watch him trying to come to terms with what he did and to deal with what will come next. He spirals down through life-threatening maladies, both physical and mental. The police are poking around, his family do their best to care for him but sometimes in ways he cannot abide, ways that will put them at too much risk even whilst he cannot find a single nice word to say to them.</p>
<p>As the noose of suspicion tightens we see his mind whirl between the possibilities of confessing all - perhaps the mental torment would at least end?  - versus fleeing, leaving everyone who loves him behind - but what right has he to be loved? - vs the satisfaction - or is it delusion? -  of getting one over on whomsoever he sees as his enemy at the time, interlaced with some contemporary politics and philosophical thinking</p>
<p>The frantic, frenetic, paranoid mind of a man who deluded himself into doing something he has no idea how to get away from, or even if he really wants to get away from it, makes for a compulsive reading experience.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781526615718">We Are Bellingcat</a> by Eliot Higgins.</p>
<p>This is the story of how Elliot Higgins went from curious internet user, through to an increasingly renowned commentator on blog articles, to starting <a href="https://brown-moses.blogspot.com/">his own blog</a> all the way through to running an increasingly large and influential organisation dedicated to open source intelligence investigations called <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/">Bellingcat</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">Open source intelligence</a>, or OSINT, is &ldquo;the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources&hellip;to produce actionable intelligence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Bellingcat, named after the fable &ldquo;<a href="https://fablesofaesop.com/belling-the-cat.html">Belling The Cat</a>&rdquo; , has famously used this technique to investigate and produce damning evidence on many geopolitical episodes, including the Malaysian Airlines <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/06/19/identifying-the-separatists-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/">flight MH17 crash</a>, the poisoning of Putin&rsquo;s enemies <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/">Alexei Navalny</a> and <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/10/09/full-report-skripal-poisoning-suspect-dr-alexander-mishkin-hero-russia/">Sergei Skripal</a>, the <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2017/08/29/database-august-12-charlottesville-videos/">unmasking of neo-Nazis</a> in Charlottesville&rsquo;s rally as well as various unpleasant and illegal incidents occurring in recent <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/09/04/geolocating-libyas-social-media-executioner/">Libyan</a> and <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/21/the-open-source-hunt-for-syrias-favourite-sarin-bomb/">Syrian</a> conflicts . This book contains details of many of their increasingly complex and impactful investigations.</p>
<p>They also run <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/workshops/">training courses</a> to let other folk learn their very transferrable, very versatile skills. They&rsquo;re open about how, why and what they did. Transparency is one of the key tenets of their organisation. Knowing that there&rsquo;s no reason for you to trust them beyond any other voice on the internet, they make a big deal of recording and sharing exactly what they did, what their sources were, what they inferred vs validated and all the outstanding questions that they couldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;an online claim is nothing more than a hypothesis, one validated only with backing evidence that others should be able to corroborate themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their motto became &ldquo;Identify, Verify, Amplify&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The most fascinating aspect to me is around the tooling. We all splurge our data every day all over the internet. Most notably on social media of course but many of our daily transactions that we don&rsquo;t explicitly share are in someone&rsquo;s database somewhere - records of your phone usage, travels, identity, financial transactions, property ownership and a whole lot more. Sometimes this kind of data is publicly available legitimately for free or at a reasonable cost. Other times hacked versions are floating about the lesser known parts of the internet. On occasion the Bellingcat team seem to slightly deviate from the &ldquo;open source&rdquo; aspect of OSINT and hold their nose and resort to paying off employees of various organisations to share data with them.</p>
<p>Knowing what sources they&rsquo;ve found useful in their work both enables  you to conduct your own investigations as well as be a bit more aware of what you&rsquo;re potentially unknowingly sharing. This is surely a recommended skill for anyone who&rsquo;s been alive in at least the past decade or so. Some of the tools they&rsquo;ve used include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several Google products: <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/">Earth</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Maps</a>, <a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/">Translate</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808">reverse image search</a>.</li>
<li>An app called SunCalc that lets you estimate the time of gday a picture was taken via the shadows in it.</li>
<li>Search engines less known to the average British or American internet user, such as Russia&rsquo;s <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a>.</li>
<li>Online catalogue and databases of munitions, vehicles, property.</li>
<li>Various specialist message boards, military sites like <a href="https://www.janes.com/">Janes</a> or sites like <a href="https://uxoinfo.com/blogcfc/client/index.cfm">Uxoinfo</a> that describe unexploded ordnance.</li>
<li>Hobbyist sites - e.g. plane-spotting or license plate websites.</li>
<li><a href="https://wikimapia.org/">Wikimapia</a></li>
<li>Dashcam videos that have been shared online</li>
<li><a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/app-for-journalists-pixifly-for-searching-instagram/s2/a556703/">Pixifly</a> , allowing searching of Instagram by location and time (seems like this is now shut down).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.panoramio.com/">Panoramio</a> for seeing geotagged photos users post.</li>
<li>Any social media site you&rsquo;re likely to have have heard of, and others you may not have - <a href="https://vk.com/">VKontakte</a>, <a href="https://ok.ru/">Odnoklassniki</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://zello.com/">Zello</a>, a chat where users share audio clips.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalGlobe">Digital Globe</a> and other commercial producers of satellite imagery.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/meedan/checkdesk">Checkdesk</a> - an app that lets people sign up to join an investigation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the-secret-app-that-gives-syrian-civilians-minutes-to-escape-airstrikes/2018/08/17/e91e66be-9cbf-11e8-b55e-5002300ef004_story.html">Syrian Sentry</a> - an app where volunteers recorded planes taking off from military airfields.</li>
<li>Europol&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/stopchildabuse">Trace an Object</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>Calling people up on the phone to get an audio sample that can be compared with other snippets.</li>
<li>Leaked customer databases</li>
<li>Open source phone databases. There are also apps that share phone numbers people have in their contacts list such as <a href="https://www.truecaller.com/">TrueCaller</a> - key here is that people&rsquo;s names appear as they do in individual&rsquo;s contact books. And some people list agents working for secretive organisations with the organisation as part of their name!</li>
<li>The many messenger apps that let you see if a given phone number is currently online.</li>
<li>Leaked data from phone companies showing where a phone was at some point in time.</li>
<li>&hellip;and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these may no longer exist in the form they were originally used in. But Bellingcat keeps an up-to-date list of tools they find useful in their investigations <a href="https://bit.ly/bcattools">here</a> - their &ldquo;Online Investigation Toolkit&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite eye-opening.</p>
<p>For anyone who&rsquo;s nerdy enough to be able to cope with running scripts or compiling code, they also develop their own in-house tools which are available on their <a href="https://github.com/bellingcat">Github repos</a> to all and sundry. As they note in the book, there is a tension between being entirely transparent and open when building killer new investigative tools and the fact that many of them could be used for nefarious purposes by folks with bad intentions, so, you know, please use them wisely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bellingcat method has endless applications. What unifies our work is a drive for accountability. We take scattered facts online and try to turn them into justice.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/13/arcade-claw-machines.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-13 10:38:41 &#43;0100">Nov 13, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>Only recently did I learn that those arcade claw machines where the game is to precisely navigate a claw over some stuffed toys or a priceless watch such that when it descends it grabs it and pops it in a chute for you to take away as winnings are literally impossible, rather than just extraordinarily difficult, to win most of the time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It turns out that a given claw has different strengths at different times. Full strength will grab and deliver the prize if you navigated it exactly right. But at all other times the claw isn&rsquo;t even in theory strong enough to hold the prize, so you&rsquo;ve no chance.</p>
<p>How strong the claw can be, and often the claw is strong, can typically be chosen or changed by the owner as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/3/8339999/claw-machines-rigged">this extract from a manual that Vox shared shows</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some claws may have several parameters. For example on occasion it might be strong enough to pick up the prize, but then then deliberately weakens and drops the object of desire just before it get over the retrieval slot, making for those ultra-addictive seeming near misses.</p>
<p>So really claw machines are not so different to &ldquo;pure&rdquo; gambling machines like fruit machines. Except you have to be both lucky <em>and</em> somewhat skilled. And they&rsquo;re less regulated in some jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Based on that manual extract it sounds like there might be a viable strategy involving secretly watching other people playing with the claw until it&rsquo;s been a while since anyone won anything and swooping in in the hope that strong mode is about to trigger. If you can live with yourself and really want that big fluffy toy teddy anyway.</p>
<p>Also as the owner can set the parameters of the machine, it&rsquo;d definitely be true that machines in some places might &ldquo;pay out&rdquo; a lot more than machines elsewhere.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/11/12/the-deleterious-effects.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-12 13:05:56 &#43;0100">Nov 12, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When Spotify and its competitors launched it heralded a whole new way to listen to music. Suddenly everyone who could afford a relatively cheap monthly subscription and a device to use it on had access to a near infinite list of the world&rsquo;s most loved music. Recommendation algorithms would expose them to new music they&rsquo;re very likely to love. At the same time, it&rsquo;d cut down on the pull that led some people to pirate their music, so that artists would get paid more fully. Smaller artists who didn&rsquo;t have the means to promote or produce huge worldwide release could get an audience beyond their local pub. What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<p>Inevitably, plenty. Naturally it&rsquo;s not only <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">extremely bad AI-written books</a> that are attempting to flood our media channels, and occasionally charts, with dross. Music provides another example, for many of the same reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the AI side of things - both the generative AIs that can &ldquo;create&rdquo; music. But also the more traditional, less hyped, AIs that are used to engage the user with the  apps concerned. And I suppose the AIs that listen to the music, more on that later.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more to be concerned about, including bad business models, bad incentives, and the exploitation that inevitably shows up once a few giant middle-men effectively monopolise the relationship between people that produce things of value and those that wish to consume them to the extent that they&rsquo;re incentives are entirely distinct from either party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an increasing fan of Marshall McLuhan&rsquo;s idea that &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a>&rdquo;. Sure, songs are still songs, but &ldquo;song&rdquo; is vague enough that there&rsquo;s plenty of room for the medium of distribution to influence its content. Perhaps the delivery method is also the message to some extent. His colleague, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message">John Culkin, opined</a> that &ldquo;we shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us&rdquo;. Our music-creating, music-promoting and music-listening tools have certainly changed in recent times.</p>
<h2 id="torrents-of-new-music-flood-the-system-each-day">Torrents of new &ldquo;music&rdquo; flood the system each day</h2>
<p>Apparently there are 120,000 <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/there-are-now-120000-new-tracks-hitting-music-streaming-services-each-day/">new music tracks being uploaded to music streaming services such as Spotify each day</a>. Each <em>day</em>. MBW calculates that at that rate this year we&rsquo;ll have added 43 million new tracks to the archives - substantially more than even the estimated 34 million tracks uploaded last year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(An ISRC is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Recording_Code">International Standard Recording Code</a>, used to uniquely identify sounds and music recordings.)</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, not all of these are new Taylor Swift songs, Beatle re-releases or even exciting new work from up-and-coming new indie bands. Some of it is literally noise; white noise, fan noise, rain noise, other noises are available. More of it is a near infinite of variety of customised &ldquo;Happy Birthday to X&rdquo; songs with X replaced by the names of most people you might imagine sending well-wishes to.</p>
<p>And an increasing amount of it is AI generated. And not even 2023-level-AI generated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Universal Music Group’s Q1 earnings call, Sir Lucian Grainge criticized what he calls the “content oversupply” that currently sees around 100,000+ tracks distributed to music streaming services each day.</p>
<p>“Not many people realize that AI has already been a major contributor to this content oversupply,” said Grainge.</p>
<p>“Most of this AI content on DSPs comes from the prior generation of AI, a technology that is not trained on copyrighted IP and that produces very poor quality output with virtually no consumer appeal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-incentive-structure-encourages-people-to-game-the-system">The incentive structure encourages people to game the system</h2>
<p>But, similar to the way <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">Kindle Unlimited pays its authors</a>, it&rsquo;s not really the quality of the track that matters. It&rsquo;s whether it was played a lot or not. It&rsquo;s the word that we&rsquo;ve perhaps all learned to dread a little: &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;. 1000 people playing a minute of white noise often produces the same revenue for the creator as 100 people listening to a 10-track album of Taylor&rsquo;s finest.</p>
<p>As the CEO of Warner Music puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can’t be that an Ed Sheeran stream is worth exactly the same as a stream of rain falling on the roof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I note he doesn&rsquo;t specify whether an Ed Sheeran stream is worth more <a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/music/why-does-everyone-hate-ed-sheeran/">or less</a> than a recording of the rain, but either way you can probably think of some track of music you personally feel confident has a great deal more value to you and perhaps even to the world at large than listening to one of a million varieties of rain, a good proportion of which might actually 2010-era auto-generated AI fake rain noise.</p>
<p>So where do we end up? With the same dynamics as we had for <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/20/terrible-aiwritten-books.html">those terrible AI-written Kindle books</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;.the inevitable coming together of the generative AI infocalypse, enshittified subscription service monopolies, misguided algorithmic recommendation systems and the incentives of modern-day capitalism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course leads &ldquo;creators&rdquo; to game the system. Which is why every time I try to listen to something popular like <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/26/listening-to-endless.html">&ldquo;Flowers&rdquo;</a> I have to be quick on the pause button if I don&rsquo;t want to end up listening to an algorithmically generated rotation of various knockoff variations of the original. Or, to be honest, one reason why for the most part I relieve the pre-Spotify era and almost always listen to music in units of albums, rather songs or playlists. As a sidenote, if this too is your preference and you&rsquo;re an Apple Music user then I heartily recommend the iOS <a href="https://www.albumstheapp.com/">Albums app</a> which near-forces you into that mode of operation.</p>
<p>Not all of the system gaming is AI adjacent of course. Humans are more than capable of coming up with their own quantity-increasing quality-reducing schemes. Six years ago, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/streaming-music-cheat-codes.html">Vulture wrote up</a> some of those shenanigans for us to peruse.</p>
<p>There are the aforementioned people trying to trick you into listening to their knockoff version of whatever the current genuine-hit song is. It might be a cover, or it might be something totally different but with a similar sounding name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the coverbots and ripoff artists who vomit out inferior versions of popular songs every week, flooding the website with dreck that only succeeds when users are misled. No one would willingly listen to King Stitch’s “Sit Down, Be Humble,” a third-rate cover of Lamar’s original, but the track has been streamed more than 300,000 times thanks to Spotify’s broad search results and a clever title designed to confuse those who don’t know the song’s real name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s entries that are not a malicious deception. They&rsquo;re just not really the same category of thing as the classic idea of an album, even though they are displayed indistinguishably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some artists, a term used very loosely here, are providing people exactly what they want. It just so happens that what they want is ephemeral nonsense. Take, for example, the artist Happy Birthday Library, whose Spotify catalogue consists of hundreds of personalized versions of “Happy Birthday” streamed more than a million times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithms and incentives naturally have an effect on the actually talented and occasionally mega-famous folks too, reshaping what they produce and share. Vulture, <a href="https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/">and others</a>, suggests that the reason Chris Brown released a 40 track album is because that&rsquo;s the way to boost your streaming numbers the most. Remember, you get paid per stream of each track - not each album. This huge-track count trick can naturally be used by lesser-known folk too</p>
<p>As they conclude, albeit perhaps with rather rose-tinted spectacles on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never before has a song title or artist name been more important than the actual songs themselves.
&hellip;
Never before have so many songs existed just so an album can have a 20th, 30th, or 40th track</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall they list 11 ways they&rsquo;ve noticed artists adapting to Spotify&rsquo;s incentives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Happy Birthday gimmick mentioned above. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to listen to a song entitled &ldquo;Happy Birthday whatever-your-name-is&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Writing songs about everything someone might conceivably search for; their example being &ldquo;the song “Have You Been to Radnor Township?” on the 93-track album Pennsylvania Songs: PA Exiting&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Releasing multiple albums with the same songs, often titled differently.</li>
<li>Release an absolutely silent &ldquo;song&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Convincing people to get their computers to fake-listen to the song.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Filling the void&rdquo; - releasing covers of songs from famous artists who aren&rsquo;t on Spotify.</li>
<li>Trying to trick people by naming their songs very similarly to more famous ones. Someone searching for Imagine Dragon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo; might not realise they accidentally clicked on the 1-hit wonder Imagine Demon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Demons&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Covering everything famous, all the time.</li>
<li>Adding unnessecary extra tracks to albums as noted above.</li>
<li>Putting your past popular singles in your new album.</li>
<li>Seeding popular Spotify playlists with fake artists - something Spotify has been accused of doing, more on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so is it all greedy users exploiting the opportunities the likes of Spotify inadvertently make available to them? No, it is not. It&rsquo;s easy to go too far in absolving the platforms for their responsibility for this.</p>
<p>For one, it&rsquo;s 2023. We know how these things go. Everything product decision is a choice. The big platforms decide where to prioritise their development. They decide what they accept and how. If some of the above isn&rsquo;t what the platforms want to promote then surely if users can find it easily enough to repeatedly write articles about the issue then so could they, given their access to reams of confidential internal data.</p>
<p>In fact they do, sometimes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Spotify <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spotify-ai-music-generator-purges-bots-listening-songs-1850419032">removed thousands of AI generated songs</a> from its catalogue. Many were those autogenerated by <a href="https://boomy.com/">Boomy</a> - a site that sells itself as enabling you to &ldquo;Create original songs in seconds, even if you&rsquo;ve never made music before&rdquo; and &quot; Submit your songs to streaming platforms and get paid when people listen&quot;.</p>
<p>Now as with many generative AI tools, it may not be a bad thing in principle. It might enable people who otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to create their own music be able to, in the same way as the image generators could allow expressions of novel creativity otherwise unavailable to most. But it&rsquo;s also catnip for folk that care more for income than art.</p>
<h2 id="robots-are-creating-music-for-robots-to-listen-to">Robots are creating music for robots to listen to</h2>
<p>So why did Spotify go on a deleting rampage of these tracks? Not particularly because they weren&rsquo;t a great experience for the average user. And there&rsquo;s certainly no prohibition on using AI to write or help write one&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>Rather it was because the people <em>listening</em> to that music were fake. Remember that Spotify pays out based on how many people listen to your tracks. So &ldquo;creators&rdquo; built bots that  &ldquo;listened&rdquo; to the tracks again and again. It&rsquo;s essentially fraud, given the terms of service.</p>
<p>So in a somewhat dystopian-feeling loop, people are using AI to create music that is mostly listened to by other AIs, no humans involved.</p>
<p>The business model and recommendation algorithms of the mainstream music streaming platforms - quantity over quality, quantity over everything - makes them as vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm">clickfarms</a> as any other type of site that provides some kind of reward for attracting lots of traffic of any kind. In this case Spotify has to pay for it directly, which is finally enough of a reason for them to act on it.</p>
<p>People are trying to measure these fake listeners. A French government organisation reported <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/fake-music-streams-france-1-billion-2021-report/">that 1-3% of all French streams</a> in 2021 were fraudulent based on data from Spotify, Deezer and Qobuz. This is likely an underestimate due to the use of VPNs and the like.</p>
<p><a href="https://beatdapp.com/">Beatdapp</a>, a company who sells a tool that looks for streaming fraud so is admittedly incentivised to claim that there&rsquo;s a lot of it, wrote that at least 10% of all streaming activity in 2022 was fraudulent. That&rsquo;s equivalent to $2 billion of revenue illegitimately extracted. They believe that it&rsquo;ll be worth $7.5 billion by 2030 if it is not stopped.</p>
<p>The fact that more streams = more money has also been more publicly exploited in the past. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/">Eternify was a service that lets users input the name of their favourite artists</a> and it&rsquo;d play their songs on repeat for exactly 30 seconds each on Spotify. 30 seconds was the threshold at which the artist gets paid, so this was a way you could optimise the income of your preferred musicians without the obstacle of having to actually listen to their output. The site would slowly count up the revenue your mouse-click had accrued for them.</p>
<p>It seems to be have been more of a protest statement from some understandably disenchanted musicians than something that aimed to enable fraudsters. And it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have saved many starving artists without a truly mass takeup. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mzhang/2015/06/23/eternify-an-easy-way-to-earn-revenue-for-your-favorite-artists-through-spotify/">Forbes calculated</a> that using it for a solid day would generate perhaps $1.44 for the artist in question. In any case, it cost Spotify directly enough to make them go to the effort of <a href="https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2015/06/26/spotify-shuts-down-royalty-boosting-scheme-eternify/">shutting it down</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-pay-most-musicians-receive-from-the-service-is-incredibly-low">The &ldquo;pay&rdquo; most musicians receive from the service is incredibly low</h2>
<p>The $1.44 a day figure reveals another not-so-hidden truth. These services are really not paying out a lot of money to the creators of what they&rsquo;re selling access to. So much so that even a committee of British MPs - a group <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-government-advert-ballet-dancer-retrain-it-cyber-oliver-dowden-b987403.html">not particularly known</a> for its sympathy or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/30/the-guardian-view-on-cuts-to-arts-funding-a-calamity-that-must-be-averted">care for artists</a> - are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473">worried about it</a>.</p>
<p>From all that revenue you&rsquo;re providing to the streaming services, the folk involved in producing the music are receiving about 16% of it.</p>
<p>Spotify is thought to be paying out between £0.002 and £0.0038 every time you play a stream. Apple Music pays a bit more, a whopping £0.0059. Youtube a bit less, about £0.00052.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;pays out&rdquo; is doing a lot of work there, as even many of the reports about &ldquo;Spotify only pays artists £x&rdquo; seem to miss. That 0.2 pence has got to be divided up between anyone with interests or rights to the music, as well as each member of the band, the composer, the writers, and so on.</p>
<p>The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57838473">provides an infographic</a> to help us visualise what that means.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the recording industry was particularly renowned for being favourable to artists even before the streaming revolution. Anyway, all in all, the recording artist(s) often might expect to receive about 13% of that 0.2p. Under a third of a penny.</p>
<p>Thirds of pennies don&rsquo;t add up fast. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musician&rsquo;s Union suggested that over 80% of musicians made less than £200 a year from streaming during 2019. 93% didn&rsquo;t break the £1000 milestone.</p>
<p>Sure, the megastars might earn substantially more than enough to survive on, but even their entourage aren&rsquo;t necessarily doing well. The writer of one of the songs on Kylie Minogue&rsquo;s number-one charting album &ldquo;Disco&rdquo; reported receiving £100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,&rdquo; she told MPs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite shameful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="spotify-seems-to-be-gaming-its-own-platform">Spotify seems to be gaming its own platform</h2>
<p>Back to the fake streams. As wrong as it is, let&rsquo;s not feel <em>too</em> sorry for some of the platforms subject to this streaming fraud. Spotify&rsquo;s seeming attempts to game it&rsquo;s own system at the expense of other artists and their own users have been written about elsewhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the time it was found to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-26/spotify-said-to-retaliate-against-artists-with-apple-exclusives?leadSource=uverify%20wall">burying songs</a> from musicians because they&rsquo;d also made deals with their rivals. Maybe that&rsquo;s understandable, maybe not, but I&rsquo;d guess most users don&rsquo;t understand that to be what&rsquo;s going on when they search for a song.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even less obvious is that sometimes Spotify decides to pay producers a flat fee to create tracks such that Spotify owns the copyright. They then upload them to their own serivce under fake artist names, people that don&rsquo;t exist. Why?</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-is-creating-its-own-recordings-and-putting-them-on-playlists/">Music Business Worldwide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would Spotify be instructing producers to write and record tracks of this nature?</p>
<p>Bingo: to appear on some of its relaxing first-party playlists, which boast millions of followers between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now they don&rsquo;t seem to get anything like as many plays as the most popular songs on the platform so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s necessarily dominating the user experience. But each time users plays a track from one of these fake artists Spotify only has to pay itself the stream royalties. Over 50 fake artists of this kind <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-spotifys-fake-artists-problem-is-an-epidemic-literally/">have been found</a> now, almost all of which have had millions of streams.</p>
<p>As ever, it&rsquo;s not entirely a black and white issue. Spotify have explicitly denied some (but perhaps not all) of these allegations. And, in this case, behind the fake artists are real people playing real music. They&rsquo;re just paid in a way much more favourable to Spotify at scale than other artists, and they seem to have an automatic route to being included in much-coveted very popular playlists.</p>
<p>Spotify curated playlists apparently account for <a href="https://bandzoogle.com/blog/how-to-get-your-music-featured-on-spotify-playlists">around a third</a> what&rsquo;s listened to on the platform in terms of time. To get onto one of them, most musicians have to actively <a href="https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/">pitch their music</a> for inclusion, one song at a time, before the song has been released. Most of the pitches, <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/behind-the-playlists-your-questions-answered-by-our-playlist-editors">around 80%</a>, are turned down without explanation.</p>
<p>Arguably, similar dynamics exist in other types of streaming services. Netflix does of course make its own shows which it heavily promotes on its own service. But as a user it does feel disingenuous to me at least. Why not label these tracks as having been produced by Spotify? Why not explain how they got onto the playlists?</p>
<p>Based on some patent applications, some folk <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/tech/spotify-could-soon-replace-real-artists-with-ai-music">seem to think</a> that eventually Spotify might take the human out of the creation process altogether, potentially filling its playlists with music they generated themselves via AI. Presumably competing against those independent users uploading their own AI music, albeit with potentially a thumb on the scale.</p>
<h2 id="enshittification-yet-again">Enshittification, yet again</h2>
<p>Platforms such as Spotify appear to potentially provide great examples of Doctorow&rsquo;s <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">theory of enshittification</a>. When they first launched they appeared provided incredible value for users, revolutionary in some ways. You could access literally millions of much-sought after music for a relatively low monthly cost - or even free on Spotify at least if you were happy to tolerate adverts - entirely on demand. A radio station perfectly attuned to your minute-by-minute preferences. A way to experience far more of the musical art than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html">you could ever afford</a> to if you were paying £12.99+ for an individual album like ye olde days. An experience much safer and easier, not to mention less criminal and more conducive to rewarding musicians than yesteryear&rsquo;s internet underground <a href="https://support.spotify.com/uk/artists/article/pitching-music-to-playlist-editors/">piracy scene</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-lofty-optimism-of-spotify-and-the-influence-of-the-streaming-revolution">The New Yorker wrote</a> about Spotify 5 years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company is essentially insisting that freer and easier access to music is the only thing that matters; everything should be available to everyone, because freedom of choice is an essential freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The platforms attracted so many listeners with this fabulous promise that they became attractive, perhaps essential, to artists. Even many of the very rich very famous names who have sworn off Spotify at some point in time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat">came</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/12/thom-yorke-solo-albums-back-on-spotify.html">back</a>, presumably for the audience and its impact on the charts. If you weren&rsquo;t popular on Spotify then you&rsquo;d not so much hope of ever topping the bill, attracting the most revenue, being the most famous.</p>
<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;d even enable vast numbers of people to realise their artistic dreams in a way they&rsquo;d otherwise never have been able to. As <a href="https://pennyfractions.ghost.io/spotify-s-revolutionary-plan-to-support-one-million-artists/">they wrote 4 years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the goal of our marketplace strategy is to harness Spotify’s ability to drive discovery to connect artists with fans on a scale that has never before existed with the goal of enabling 1 million artists to live off of their work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now, in the final stage, the platforms claw back more and more of the value for themselves.</p>
<p>They stop gaining marketshare only by virtue of being <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/02/will-spotify-ever-turn-a-profit/">able to sustain periods of loss</a>.  They <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630821/spotify-design-home-music-podcasts-audiobooks-app">change the user interface</a> longer than their competitors. What&rsquo;s promoted, when and how becomes something less aligned with the reasons that many users may have originally signed up. They try to make it inconvenient for either <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/01/how-to-quit-spotify-and-what-you-give-up-if-you-do.html">users</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/03/why-artists-leaving-spotify/">creators</a> to leave, and costly for artists to make deals with competitors.  They acquire potential future competitors or expand into adjacent-ish markets to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/spotify-needs-to-profit-from-a-music-revolution/2023/01/18/e71c548c-96ef-11ed-a173-61e055ec24ef_story.html">increase the perceived lock-in</a>. They <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021">raise prices</a> - although some believe that the recent near-universal streaming price rises in conjunction with a cost-of-living crisis is resulting in <a href="https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2023/10/30/online-piracy-streaming">an increase in piracy</a>. They alter recommendation algorithms, alter incentives.</p>
<p>All very logical from the point of view of shareholder value et al, at least in the short term. It&rsquo;s not necessarily driven by maliciousness; I&rsquo;m sure many of Spotify&rsquo;s employees love music, love musicians, embrace that vision of enabling a million artists to live off their work. It&rsquo;s just that at the end of the day the company&rsquo;s own incentive is all about coming up with the financial arrangements that most benefit themselves in the marketplace, whether or not it&rsquo;s at the expense of either or both sides of the user-creator relationship that&rsquo;s the fundamental reason that they can exist in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="the-tools-shape-us">The tools shape us</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s more amorphous to define and subjective to evaluate, but perhaps these services have significantly changed how we tend to consume music beyond the technical side of things. McLuhan and Culkin&rsquo;s quotes apply on the demand side too. The medium is the message. We shape our tools, and thereafter they shape us.</p>
<p>In days of yore, listeners would usually have to invest financially in a specific number of physical instantiations of music; a cassette tape, a CD or an LP album amongst other formats. In the iPod era this moved onto digital downloads, but still at the level of purchasing individual songs rather than access to a smorgasbord of (a somewhat misleading perception of) everything everywhere, all at once, all the time.</p>
<p>For most people this put a limit on how much music they had access to. This seems prima facie bad at first glance, and perhaps it is. But maybe it also encouraged folk to spend more time and intention in choosing what they listened to, more time exploring any one individual work.  I expect a fair proportion of people don&rsquo;t even know what they recently listened to when they&rsquo;ve opened their app at the start of the day and hit the &ldquo;especially for you&rdquo; playlist.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">the Guardian talked to a bunch of people</a> who&rsquo;d moved from streaming music back to more traditional forms of consumption they found some examples of this. Here&rsquo;s Lethem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[With streaming] there’s endless accessibility, but you’re not really listening to anything. At least that’s what it started feeling like to me. I’m experiencing so much music, but am I really listening to any of it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like what the algo chose then you can just hit skip 5 seconds in and be provided with something else that tries to hook you in. And it&rsquo;ll continue forever. There&rsquo;s no real concept of sitting down to appreciate an album end-to-end when the album is a literally endless playlist.</p>
<p>Many of these services do let you listen by album of course, at least if you pay them for that ability. I&rsquo;d be curious to know how many people still do that. It&rsquo;s certainly not the style of listening I feel like I see most heavily encouraged by the apps. Similar to the Youtube and Netflix style next-episode auto-play, the last thing they want to do is make you think you &ldquo;finished&rdquo; something to the extent you close the app.</p>
<p>Fairly incredibly, Spotify even used to default to shuffling the tracks of the album you selected into a random order <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/21/spotify-hides-shuffle-button-adele-albums-should-tell-a-story">before Adele requested they stopped doing that</a> because, of course, there is usually a reason why the tracks were put in that order in the first place. To quote her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some more conceptual albums would surely simply make very little sense out of order.</p>
<p>So hey, it&rsquo;s not like Spotify <em>never</em> listens to feedback, at least from megastars. Although even now you do have to be a paying customer of Spotify in order to be given the privilege of a &ldquo;play in the proper order&rdquo; button.</p>
<p>More recently Amazon actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-music-alexa-restrictions-shuffle-11674054533">went in the opposite direction</a> for its basic music streaming service. Subscribers to Amazon Prime, a service that costs around £9 a month and offers a variety of benefits to Amazon customers including music streaming, found that instead of the previous behaviour of being to choose what they listen to, when they requested music by a particular artist they would get a single track from that artist followed by a load of tracks from other people. Even their manually customised playlists started to shuffle around.</p>
<p>An unhappy customer reports his confusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. McKenna, who lives near Albany, N.Y., spent years curating Amazon Music playlists&hellip;.Recently, the app began playing a rock song he had never heard. When he got to the office, he tried to click on a Kenny Chesney song in his playlist, but it didn’t work. Songs he didn’t recognize kept playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Bob, his chronologically-defined playlists not any more being chronological was enough to drive him back to CDs and Windows Media Player - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ve gone back to 2005&rdquo;. The only way to keep hold of your Amazon Music collection and listen to what you want to when you want to now became to upgrade to the more expensive &ldquo;Amazon Unlimited&rdquo; service.</p>
<p>Shifts in people&rsquo;s listening choices are certainly not all about these services removing features that were once there. Even where you can in theory still choose to listen to exactly what you want, here&rsquo;s Nick from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">previously-mentioned Guardian article</a> confirming a shift in his behaviour he experienced soon after switching to streaming that I suspect is quite common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found myself selecting more and more just one-off songs from an artist, whereas before I’d been inclined to save a whole album</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; alternative 20 years ago was to listen to the radio or a TV channel like MTV where for the most part you are subjected to other people&rsquo;s musical selections. From beginning to end, with no skip button. This might let you discover something so new and wonderful that you - and your 2023 recommendation algorithm - would never have considered if left to your own devices. On the other hand you had to listen to a lot of dross you didn&rsquo;t like, and would perhaps never happen to be listening at the right time to hear songs you were more likely to enjoy  - so again, nothing here is all good or all bad. But it&rsquo;s worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Finlay, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/sep/27/theres-endless-choice-but-youre-not-listening-fans-quitting-spotify-to-save-their-love-of-music">the same Guardian article</a>, spoke to the issue above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With streaming, he says: “If I didn’t gel with an album or an artist’s work at first, I tended not to go back to it.” But he realised that a lot of his all-time favourite albums were ones that grew on him over time. “Streaming was actually contributing to some degree of dismissal of new music.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jared speaks to both upsides and downsides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My musical experiences definitely feel more dedicated and focused. It’s not as convenient. I’ll reluctantly admit that I listen to less music. Although on Spotify, I wasn’t necessarily listening to stuff. I was checking out the first 15 seconds and hitting skip. Now, I have to work for it and I like that. I can use the internet as a search tool but I’m not using it as a means to listen. I really have to seek things out and research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virginia likewise, exhibiting a pattern I found myself adhering to at first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will listen to one song 100 times in a row, but I won’t give the rest of the album a chance. Before I used streaming services, I would listen to the whole thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even conceptually, the word &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; has connotations that may affect how we feel about what we&rsquo;re listening to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before there was streaming music, what else was streaming? This idea that you can just turn on a faucet, and out comes music. It’s something that leaves everyone to take it for granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, many of these ex-streamer folk talked about the extra work they now had to do to find what they like. It can comes at a financial cost too, which risks making some of what I wrote seem elitist and gatekeepery as well as Ludditey. After all why should only people with time and wealth to spare have access to reasonable quantities of music? What&rsquo;s wrong with having convenient and cheap access to so much art? Nothing on the face of it, if we can find a business model that doesn&rsquo;t incentivise its enshittification and abuse of the creators.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-isnt-necessarily-cheap-and-you-end-up-owning-nothing">Streaming isn&rsquo;t necessarily cheap, and you end up owning nothing</h2>
<p>Although I would note that for the moderately well-off that it&rsquo;s not clear to me that paying for a year of Spotify is necessarily cheaper than buying a few albums that mean something to you. Right now, Spotify paid edition would cost you £131.88 a year. That would also buy you a good amount of singles, albums, whatever you&rsquo;re into. That might well suit people who prefer to or simply happen to end up listening to a certain subset of everything repeatedly. And it&rsquo;s almost certainly better for the artists concerned.</p>
<p>It also means your music becomes &ldquo;yours&rdquo;. You can keep a CD or, let&rsquo;s be realistic given it&rsquo;s 2023, an MP3 or lossless music file whether or not you want to keep subscribing to any given service. I&rsquo;ve been an Apple Music subscriber in my time, and I liked the service. But assuming one day you will choose to, or be forced to, stop paying the company the monthly fee then it&rsquo;s all gone. If I want to switch to a different service then it&rsquo;s a faff. Copying your favourite playlists, likes, subscribes, downloads et al  to a new place isn&rsquo;t necessarily easy - the new service may even be missing some of your tracks. And moving your carefully refined recommendation algorithms across services isn&rsquo;t on anyone&rsquo;s radar at all and probably won&rsquo;t ever be; it&rsquo;s each company&rsquo;s secret sauce.</p>
<p>You also certainly can&rsquo;t give your collection or pieces of it to anyone. You can&rsquo;t give what you don&rsquo;t own. I can&rsquo;t find it now, but I remember reading a story about the joy and meaning someone got from inheriting the music collection of their sadly recently-deceased father; the feelings and memories that listening to what he&rsquo;d collected over a lifetime evoked. But that&rsquo;s something that likely becomes unavailable with a shift to streaming.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any documentation about what happens to someone&rsquo;s music streaming account when they die, outside of <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;filter=location&amp;location=forum-board:spotifyaccountrelated&amp;q=deceased">several posts on the Spotify forums</a> that mainly end in &ldquo;try asking customer services&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s surely not something that someone inherits&gt; If you don&rsquo;t know the person&rsquo;s password and can open to their email then access may be gone for good. If it&rsquo;s a pay-for service then I imagine every trace of it simply vanishes as soon as the credit card fails to bill.</p>
<p>Talking about dying is admittedly a little dramatic. But there are other ways your favoured streaming services might be denied to you even whilst alive. Services close, even ones from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-play-music-will-shutdown-completely-in-december-heres-how-to-save-your-music">hugely successful companies</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say goodbye to Google Play Music, the service will be going away for good in December 2020 and with it, all your music if you don&rsquo;t transfer it over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you old enough to remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio">Rdio</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Music">Beats Music</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Music_Unlimited">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a>? Or any of the other 20-30 services currently listed on Wikipedia in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services#Discontinued_services">its &ldquo;Discontinued services&rdquo; section</a>, either entirely shut down or purchased by and replaced with the current handful of big players.</p>
<p>Or you may simply lose access to your account. If Apple, Amazon, Spotify, or whoever you&rsquo;re with decide for some reason that they don&rsquo;t want you to have an account then it&rsquo;s all gone. The various chatboards of the internet are full of stories of people losing their accounts from the big tech firms. Oftentimes they&rsquo;re more concerned about their emails or photos than their music. But it&rsquo;s all the same. If Apple, Spotify or the rest of them decide you&rsquo;ve been misbehaving, or can&rsquo;t be convinced that you are who you say you are, then whatever effort you&rsquo;ve put into maintaining your collection is lost. I&rsquo;d imagine it&rsquo;s probably rarer for this to happen with music streaming services than some categories - it&rsquo;s harder to imagine being accused of &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; a music streaming account but as many Reddit posts show, it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>For the paid-only services, which is most of them, of course the same happens if your circumstances change such that you can no longer afford the service. And even if not, you&rsquo;re bound to implicitly supporting any changes in the streaming company&rsquo;s rules, strategies, personnel or ethics if you want to keep the music flowing. This might well be a price worth paying for many people, for most people. But it is a price.</p>
<p>If one of these eventualities does happen to you, then there are third-party services that try attempt to transfer your streaming collections and various metadata between one such service and another, although I haven&rsquo;t tried any of them out enough to know how well they work. But not if you already lost access to the service you want to move from. And of course they won&rsquo;t be able to transfer your playlists, likes et al to a service that doesn&rsquo;t have the particular track involved.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://rpsychologist.com/cohend/">This interactive visualisation</a> is a great way of explaining or visualising what a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d">Cohen&rsquo;s d effect size</a> actually means in the real world.</p>
<p>Enter the d in question, or by clicking the cogwheel you can enter means and standard deviations, and the slightly-arcane-seeming resulting &rsquo;d' value is translated into an explanation rather easier to get one&rsquo;s head around.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With a Cohen&rsquo;s d of 0.80, 78.8% of the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will be above the mean of the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group (Cohen&rsquo;s U3), 68.9% of the two groups will overlap, and there is a 71.4% chance that a person picked at random from the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will have a higher score than a person picked at random from the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group (probability of superiority).</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to have one more favorable outcome in the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group compared to the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group, we need to treat 3.5 people on average. This means that if there are 100 people in each group, and we assume that 20 people have favorable outcomes in the &ldquo;control&rdquo; group, then 20 + 28.3 people in the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; group will have favorable outcomes.</p>

Especially those pesky foreigners.</p>
<p>Even her fellow Conservative, Bob Blackman, who heads up a group that aims to tackle homelessness thinks this is a phrase too far and believes she should use &ldquo;wiser words&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Amnesty has it right - claiming that there&rsquo;s queues of people just longing to live the decadent luxury of shelter-free lifestyle is nothing but a &ldquo;very convenient cop-out&rdquo; for a Government whose repeated failures do nothing but exacerbate the crisis.</p>
<p>In reality the unhoused &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo; is not so glamorous. A group of interested charities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/05/charities-criticise-suella-braverman-for-claim-homelessness-is-lifestyle-choice">put together a letter</a> better explaining the experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People sleeping rough frequently experience violence and abuse. The impact on their physical and mental health is significant. The average age of death for people experiencing homelessness is just 45 for men and 43 for women. This is not a life people choose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The homelessness issue, particularly the more extreme cases where people find themselves forced to sleep on the streets, is especially frustrating because it&rsquo;s also entirely unnecessary. We know how to solve it if we really wanted to.</p>
<p>Because we already did, back in early Covid times when the UK chose to find a way to <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1254504256423542786">house the vast majority</a> of rough sleepers. Yes, under a Conservative government!  Some of those provided shelter even gained access to assistance with things like benefit applications or medical treatments.</p>
<p>But apparently all decent and humane things have to come to an end. In July 2020 the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/coronavirus-homelessness-uk-rough-sleepers-lockdown-tories">funding was withdrawn and governmental responsibility for helping these people in need shirked</a> - even whilst Covid was of course still very much circulating around.</p>
<p>Back to contemporary times where not only are we supposed to believe that living on the streets is universally nothing but a lifestyle choice, but that the largest threat to the fabric of British society is&hellip;tents.</p>
<p>So much so that the Home Secretary is seemingly trying to slot in a new policy that will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/07/tax-on-vapes-could-be-part-of-plans-to-create-a-smokefree-generation-in-uk">fine any charity that gives a tent to a person without shelter</a>. This seems to be a step too far for even many of the current Conservative party, so tbd on whether it makes it into the Kings Speech or not.</p>
<p>Either way, with ideas like this a certain contingent of today&rsquo;s Conservative party does seem to have developed some real &ldquo;<a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/22637762/vox-conversations-adam-serwer-the-cruelty-is-the-point">The Cruelty Is The Point</a>&rdquo; vibes.</p>

			 <p>Via some leaked documents the Observer got their hands on, we learn that the government is thinking about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/04/plans-to-redefine-extremism-would-include-undermining-uk-values">widening the formal definition of &lsquo;extremism&rsquo;</a> such that it&rsquo;ll read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremism is the promotion or advancement of any ideology which aims to overturn or undermine the UK&rsquo;s system of parliamentary democracy, its institutions and values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even have to be doing &lsquo;extremist things&rsquo; yourself. You might just not be disapproving of the folk that do hard enough.</p>
<p>Part of the definition that this Brave New World of people who spend their time <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/12/please-lets-not.html">sitting in other people&rsquo;s cars talking about freedom</a> and their friends will be considering, if the leak doesn&rsquo;t kill it, also includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustained support for, or continued uncritical association with organisations or individuals who are exhibiting extremist behaviours</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a slight worry that this blog, perhaps even this post, will become technically ripe for a referral to the anti-extremism authorities.</p>
<p>I mean, with the criteria of undermining &lsquo;the UK&rsquo;s system of parliamentary democracy&rsquo; featuring up top, might we be in theoretical trouble for having cast a vote in favour of changing the electoral system we vote under in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_referendum">2011 national referendum</a>? What remains of <a href="https://tech.libdems.org.uk/news/article/proportional-representation-2">the Lib Dems</a> better watch out!</p>
<p>The various civil rights groups we have are rightly rather unhappy about this.</p>
<p>From the director of <a href="https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This proposed change would be a reckless and cynical move, threatening to significantly suppress freedom of expression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor of <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/">Index on Censorship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an unwarranted attack on freedom of expression and would potentially criminalise every student radical and revolutionary dissident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The racial justice director of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of extremism and its usage in counter-terrorism policies like [counter-terrorism strategy] Prevent is already being applied so broadly it seeks to effectively hinder people from organising and mobilising. The proposed definition takes this even further and could criminalise any dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The leaked Govenrment document lists some organisations that they&rsquo;d consider as being &lsquo;captured&rsquo; by this proposed new definition. These include <a href="https://mcb.org.uk/">Muslim Council of Britain</a>, <a href="https://www.palestineaction.org/">Palestine Action</a> and <a href="https://www.mend.org.uk/">Muslim Engagement and Development</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the current definition of extremism we have is particularly narrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I suppose at least you have to be &lsquo;actively opposed&rsquo; at present. And, judging by the fact that more of our politicians aren&rsquo;t in extremism jail, it seems like at least the latter part of the definition isn&rsquo;t particularly strongly enforced.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s stopped <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-deeply-concerning-peaceful-climate-activists-were-referred-dubious-anti-terrorism">at least 45 peaceful environmental activists</a> being referred to the Government&rsquo;s current anti-extremism program. That situation that provoked Liberty to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/prevent-environment-animal-activists-referred-extremism">speak out once again</a> at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This reinforces long-held concerns that the government&rsquo;s staggeringly broad definition of extremism enables the police to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As ever, even if for some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/01/amnesty-calls-for-prevent-strategy-to-be-abolished-over-human-rights-abuses">absolutely inexplicable</a> reason you trust the current government and other arms of the state not to abuse the extraordinarily wide definitions of these very hot-button, very political, very emotional topics, one must remember that things change. Some even worse
folk could come along in the future. And it&rsquo;d be nice if they didn&rsquo;t automatically inherit the power to silence or punish anything that could be vaguely categorised as dissent against their preferences.</p>

			 <p>I often wondered what happened if you accidentally tick the &ldquo;Yes I have committed genocide&rdquo; box on the <a href="https://usa-esta.com/esta-resources/what-are-the-esta-eligibility-questions/">strange form</a> you&rsquo;re asked to fill in when travelling to the US.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, as part of the visa-waiver process to fly from the UK to the US you have to fill in your details and answer a series of increasingly harrowing questions, the apex of which is being asked to respond yes or no to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it turns out that inadvertently ticking the yes box has happened more than once so there&rsquo;s an answer. It seems to be more along the lines of subjecting you to hefty delays, cancellation and expensive bureaucratic hoops to jump through rather than getting thrown in jail. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s still annoying though.</p>
<p>Stories abound.</p>
<p>First <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45678517">there&rsquo;s Mandie</a> who encountered an obstacle in working through her bucket-list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cancer patient Mandie Stevenson had to postpone a bucket list trip to New York after she accidentally labelled herself a terrorist on her visa waiver form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then a prospective Christmas vacation was ruined for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/john-stevenson-us-visa-ban-terrorist-esta-form-mistake-a8660441.html">an older gentleman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Scottish couple&rsquo;s festive holiday plans are in disarray after a 70-year-old grandfather accidentally declared himself a terrorist on a crucial visa form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s now afraid he&rsquo;ll never be let in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They looked up my Esta number and said ‘you’re a terrorist’. I told them that I was 70 years old and I don’t even recognise what that means.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally for now we have someone at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/16/baby-us-embassy-interview-visa-esta-terrorist">the other end of the age spectrum</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A three-month old baby was summoned to the US embassy in London for an interview after his grandfather mistakenly identified him as a terrorist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But was it truly a mistake? Perhaps only mostly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s obviously never engaged in genocide, or espionage, but he has sabotaged quite a few nappies in his time, though I didn’t tell them that at the US embassy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>volunteered his grandfather.</p>

<p>I just discovered that <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/">Verso</a> appears to have a <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/pages/book-club">book club</a> that threatens to be extremely dangerous in terms of adding vast backlogs to the TBR list of anyone that way inclined.</p>
<p>From just £8 a month they send you copies of every new book they publish that month - or you can pay a bit more to get a couple of of physical books on top of that. So that&rsquo;s going to add 100 probably fairly heavy-going books per year to the now-entirely-detached-from-reality schedule.</p>

			 <p>What&rsquo;s going on in the Middle East at the moment - after Hamas committed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel">an appalling attack</a> on Israel and Israel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war">responded with an all-encompassing war</a> - feels too mind-bendingly awful to sensibly comment on.</p>
<p>But it is an extra shame to see how it, as world events often seem to do, translates to an senseless, pointless, futile increase in acts of criminal hatred and violence in faraway places.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/israel-palestine-hamas-gaza-london-hate-crime-b1116514.html">So far this month</a> there&rsquo;s been 174 incidents of Islamophobic crime recorded in London, which is an increase of 176% compared to the 65 reported in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The increase in anti-Semitic offences has been even higher. There&rsquo;s been 408 such offences recorded. That&rsquo;s an increase of almost 1400% compared to the 28 recorded in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The police have made 75 arrests so far that they say are linked to the conflict.</p>
<p>In general, crime report statistics are notoriously difficult to interpret. There are <a href="https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-accurate-are-british-crime-statistics-22462">many</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46894162">reasons</a> that crime report numbers can change that are unrelated to the number of crimes that actually took place. But these changes are so stark and so sadly explainable and predictable that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine this shift isn&rsquo;t real.</p>

<p>Avagadro&rsquo;s constant is 6.02 x 10^23 and thus on the date Americans call 10/23 at 6:02 it needs commemorating.</p>
<p>For anyone who forgot chemistry, per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant">Wikipedia</a> it&rsquo;s useful as a kind of conversion factor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Avogadro constant is also the factor that converts the average mass of one particle, in grams, to the molar mass of the substance, in grams per mole (g/mol)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s to say, given that a water molecule has a molar mass of 18  - the oxygen provides an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/atomic-weight">atomic weight</a> of 16, and each of the two hydrogen molecules contribute 1 extra - we define one mole of water as the amount of water that has a mass of 18 grams.  And to end up with 18 grams of water you need lots of water molecules, more specifically 6.02 x 10^23 of them.</p>
<p>In the same way if you wanted 16 grams of oxygen, you&rsquo;d need to find 6.02 x 10^23 molecules of it, and so on.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>TIL: The 2000 calories per day recommendation you see on food labels that say things like &ldquo;Eating this biscuit uses up 20% of your recommended daily calorie intake&rdquo; is not really based on a ton of rigorous science.</p>
<p>Rather, it seems to be a very rounded version of a wide-ranging number of calories that Americans reported eating on a survey from a few decades ago. So it more represents vaguely what the average person reported that ate 33 years ago than something that is in theory an actually recommendation for what you should eat.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2016-06-14/who-actually-needs-a-2-000-calorie-diet">US News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;.not only was the calorie standard not derived based on prevalent scientific equations that estimate energy needs based on age, height, weight and physical activity levels, but the levels were not even validated to ensure that the self-reported ranges were actually accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general I believe there&rsquo;s multiple studies out there that suggests that self-reported food consumption tends to systematically underestimate what was actually consumed - for example &ldquo;<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00090/full">Traditional Self-Reported Dietary Instruments Are Prone to Inaccuracies and New Approaches Are Needed</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plus people&rsquo;s needs vary a lot based on at least demographic and behavioural factors. There are plenty of people for which 2000 is substantially more than would be recommended if their goal was to maintain their current weight.</p>

<p>An important note for the handful of people that don’t know how Wordle works is that if you lose the game then it tells you the answer, so I suppose the premise is that if you’re independently looking it up you must be up to no good.</p>
<p>The claim is that people who live in states that are more religious or &lsquo;culturally tight&rsquo; - having stricter, stronger, more enforced social norms - are less likely to cheat at Wordle.</p>
<p><a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/research-lead-who-cheats-at-wordle-the-case-for-critical-ignoring-building-a-rat-utopia-and-more/">Behavioralscienist.org</a> reproduces one of their charts.</p>

<p>Intuitively I feel like there’s plenty of other possible explanations for this pattern out there - the paper is paywalled so I haven’t read the full thing to know what else they considered and to what level of rigour.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, never trust an East Coast wordler I guess.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to The Ezra Klein Show podcast episode &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-ama-april2023.html">Why A.I. Might Not Take Your Job or Supercharge the Economy</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s spot on regarding the real AI alignment problem.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> that some super-powerful computer brain will eventually decide to remove the human race so it can get on with manufacturing paperclips. If anything remotely like that is a plausible scenario then of course we need to work on the knotty problem of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; AI alignment before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>But not at the expense of our present-day major AI-related alignment problem. Today&rsquo;s critical AI alignment problem is that the basic motivations of the organisations that develop, own and often hold some kind of monopoly over the most powerful AIs are usually not aligned with the public good in general, and almost never aligned with protecting or promoting the interests of the worst-off in society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, AI development is being driven principally by the question of can Microsoft beat Google to market? What does Meta think about all that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interests of companies, governments and some other types of institutions are not usually aligned with the interests of humanity as a whole.  I&rsquo;d probably generalise even further to say that the greater social and economic structures that most of us live under now are not aligned with the interests of the majority of the people enmeshed in them today, whether or not they may have served us well in some ways in the past.</p>
<p>Admittedly the veracity of these sorts of claims of course always depends on what you feel society should be optimised for, it&rsquo;s subjective rather than objective. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely to me that in a world where a primary motivation for the most cutting-edge AI development is something like &ldquo;How can Big Tech company X make a more impressive seeming and addictive chatbot than company Y such that its shareholders get richer faster?&rdquo; is likely to produce the best possible result in terms of maximising the benefits for almost any of humanity.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s main revenue stream remains advertising. Assuming that persists, I doubt society as a whole is going to benefit much by Google&rsquo;s brightest minds figuring out how to use these amazing new technologies to build better adverts, to make us click on more things we&rsquo;re not really interested in, more likely to buy things we don&rsquo;t really want.</p>
<p>Sure, the natural focus of these companies might help those who -  to borrow a famous phrase - own the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production">means of production</a> become ever more rich, ever more monopolistic, ever more exploitative. But beyond that why should we imagine that a product designed to make shareholders rich would be especially aligned with any other outcome?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not want the shape and pace of AI development to be decided by the competitive pressures between functionally three firms. I think the idea that we&rsquo;re going to leave this to Google, Meta and Microsoft is a kind of lunacy, like a societal lunacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generating extra money for rich people may not be the primary personal driver for developers in these fields. In fact I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not. No matter our job, few of us turn up each day exclusively motivated by the idea that by end of our workday we may have increased the wealth of some other firm&rsquo;s investment managers.</p>
<p>For a start, a certain type of person, me included, finds these technologies to be intrinsically interesting - witness the rapid development of open source alternatives to the big tech AI tools that have been rapidly developed by volunteers. Albeit volunteers that usually don&rsquo;t have access to anything like the massive resources that the Big Tech firms can bear to these tasks.</p>
<p>And if modern-day AI tools are as revolutionary as some believe then there&rsquo;s a huge amount of increased social good potentially within our grasp, especially if we believe that most people are fundamentally &ldquo;good&rdquo; in important ways. But people operate inside contexts that provide structures often far more powerful than the individual in terms of promoting their own rules, regulations, incentives and goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you have to actually ask as a society, what are you trying to achieve? What do you want from this technology?</p>
<p>If the only question here is what does Microsoft want from the technology? Or Google. That&rsquo;s stupid. That is us abdicating what we actually need to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this general idea doesn&rsquo;t only affect AI. It&rsquo;s a constant battle in the world of technology and beyond.</p>

			 <p>IPSO rules that the Mail on Sunday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/28/braverman-ethnicity-child-grooming-gangs-false-mail-on-sunday">must apologise</a> for publishing an article by Suella Braverman that claimed that almost all child grooming gangs in the UK are of British-Pakistani origin due to &lsquo;cultural attitudes completely incompatible with British values&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Our esteemed Home Secretary&rsquo;s claim is of course a lie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regulator said Braverman&rsquo;s decision to link &ldquo;the identified ethnic group and a particular form of offending was significantly misleading&rdquo; because the Home Office&rsquo;s own research had concluded offenders were mainly from white backgrounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel a tiny, tiny bit of sympathy for the paper in that apparently they did double-check the claim with the offices of the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister. And it&rsquo;d be sort of fair in a less ludicrous world to assume that any normal boss of a department wouldn&rsquo;t publicly and provably lie about about the research that their own department did. But by now we surely all know that we clearly don&rsquo;t live in that kind of world.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780525620785">Mexican Gothic</a> by Silvia Moreno-Garcia.</p>
<p>Rich young partygirl Noemi - more used to the 1950s Mexico City socialite scene than anything more gothic in nature -  is persuaded to go see what&rsquo;s up with her recently-married cousin Catalina after receiving a strange letter from her claiming that she&rsquo;s being poisoned and that her very house is filled with &ldquo;these restless dead, these ghosts, fleshless things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>No-one is takes these weird haunted house claims literally, although sure enough when she turns up the house is a big old isolated mansion, very creepy, rotting away, covered by mold and fungus. She meets a few inhabitants who are a bit weird, in similarly creepy, slightly stereotypical, ways.</p>
<p>But what about her previously well-adjusted cousin? Is she really being poisoned? Does she suffer from some malady, whether of the physical or mental realm? Or is her &ldquo;<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISeeDeadPeople">I see dead people</a>&rdquo; (in walls) claim somehow the truth? Well, I&rsquo;m obviously not going to spoil that. Other than to say that what goes down is a bit grotesque in places, but suitably so.</p>
<p>If one wants to read a little more deeply and generally into the tale, there are obvious callouts to themes of female disempowerment, the colonisation mindset, the absolute exploitation of people deemed lesser than the (once) rich and powerful who have somehow managed to delude themselves into believing in their own innate superiority.</p>
<p>The house is a character unto itself, dark and isolating. Insanity - if that&rsquo;s what it is? -  confusion and disorientation prevail, with an increasing sense of dread. Many of the mainstays of gothic literature are to be found.  But even without the political analysis, I found it a compelling and creepy read.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/jury-duty">Jury Duty</a>.</p>
<p>Caved into the show that almost every American I know seems to be talking about. It&rsquo;s a reality gambit where they follow a guy who believes he&rsquo;s taking part in a documentary about how the US judicial system works from the point of view of being in the jury.</p>
<p>Only of course everyone else he encounters - the fellow jurists, the bailiffs, the judge, the complainant, defendant and their litigators - really everyone - are actors and the case is entirely fictional.</p>
<p>Of course semi-scripted hijinks ensue and we get to wonder if and at what point we might ever have realised what&rsquo;s going on had we been selected.</p>
<p>On the surface it seems like in Ronald Gladden they&rsquo;ve found the most amiable, well meaning, diligent and balanced person out there for their mark. Someone who might actually be able to handle every facet of his dutiful existence for a few weeks turning out to be entirely fake, a real life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show">Truman Show</a>.</p>
<p>Fervently hoping he won&rsquo;t end up being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck">milkshake duck</a>. And that the camera crews come back if he ever gets selected for jury duty for real. What would it take to convince him this time it&rsquo;s for real?</p>
<p>Oh - beware this paragraph might be a bit spoilery -  but I felt compelled to check and it turns out that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soaking_(sexual_practice)">practice of soaking</a> isn&rsquo;t something the show invented. it&rsquo;s (probably) real courtesy of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints amongst other <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/the-hook-up/soaking-mormon-sex-tiktok-viral-jump-humping/13572802">venerable institutions</a> .

			 <p>Monopolies gonna monopoly. Now that Amazon is so dominant that many online retailers feel like they have no choice but to sell their products via them, Amazon squeezes them ever harder. At this point their fees represent <a href="https://ilsr.org/AmazonMonopolyTollbooth-2023/">almost half of the third-party sellers' revenue</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first half of 2023, using a variety of fees, Amazon took 45 percent of sellers’ revenue in the U.S. That’s up from 35 percent in 2020, and 19 percent in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, most of those businesses go on to fail.</p>
<p>The three main categories of costs are the:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Referral fee: usually 15% of the revenue. This was previously the only or main cost charged to sellers for listing their products on Amazon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising fees: which counter to many people&rsquo;s intuition includes not only the more obvious adverts, but also the products Amazon highlights as &ldquo;highly rated&rdquo; and other such categories. You might think that the &ldquo;highly rated&rdquo; products are the products rated most highly on Amazon. But no - they&rsquo;re the products someone is willing to pay to be featured. The consequences of this also affect their placement in the general Amazon search results. Apparently most sellers feel like they have to use these features to stand a chance of getting sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fulfillment fees. These are charged for the privilege of having Amazon warehouse and ship your product. Most of the top sellers pay for this. Why? Because if not the products are not permitted to be eligible for Prime, which puts customers of - a new policy brought in 3 years ago.  Because running 2 fulfilment services is expensive this tends to mean suppliers send their non-Amazon originating orders through &ldquo;Fulfilled by Amazon&rdquo; too, again increasing their take.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon collects enough money from these fees - $82 billion in the first half of 2023  - such that it covers the entire cost of fulfilling both the third party orders and their own direct Amazon sales. Thus Amazon doesn&rsquo;t need to consider warehousing and shipping costs for their own products, because the money they charge third party sellers to cover their fulfilment costs in fact also pays for Amazon&rsquo;s own fulfilment costs. This is one reason why they can advantage themselves ever further by offering consumers lower prices than there is any hope that their rivals could match.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this next rule is legal, but sellers are also <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-09-21-amazons-185-billion-pay-to-play-system/">required to never charge less for their products on other sites than they do on Amazon</a> if they want to sell anything on Amazon.</p>
<p>This means that sellers can&rsquo;t pass the costs Amazon imposes on them to their own buyers who choose to use the Amazon ecosystem. Either they have to take the hit themselves, or they have to build the cost of operating with Amazon into the prices of every product they sell anywhere.  This then either results in the business having to raises their prices to consumers irrespective of whether Amazon was involved or not, or making it that extra bit less likely for the business to survive for long enough to become sustainable.</p>

			 <p>Brilliant.org has <a href="https://brilliant.org/lesson/the-overton-paradox/">a fun interactive explainer</a> of the Overton Paradox, at least as enacted in the US.</p>
<p>The paradox is as follows: Why is it that on average people are more likely to say that they&rsquo;re politically conservative when they get older, but yet when you ask them about their actual beliefs they appear to have become a little more liberal?</p>
<p>Along the way, we learn about the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-007-6179-7_88-1">difference between age effects and cohort effects</a>, which is important to understand in many domains of analysis.</p>
<p>Spoiler: the theory suggested is along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, people judge their left/right position relative to the perceived center of the population rather than by adherence to certain policy ideas.</li>
<li>The center has being trending more liberal over time, faster than the average drift an individual person makes over their lifetime.</li>
<li>Whilst both are likely real effects, the main driver of the centre shifting is the net replacement of older people of one generation, typically more conservative, with younger people from a newer one who are typically more liberal.</li>
<li>Nonetheless, each group, whether self-proclaimed conservative or liberal becomes more liberal as time goes on: a liberal from the 1970s has similar beliefs to a conservative from 2022. They&rsquo;ll just think they&rsquo;re more conservative because the baseline has changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a world-domination strategy game vaguely along the lines of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civilisation game</a>. But far simpler to understand and much quicker to play.</p>
<p>You pick a tribe and are inserted into an unexplored territory of mystery, whereupon you gain the all-important points by exploring, researching, building up your towns and army, as well as potentially battling any opponents you come across who are doing the same. These can be computer enemies or there&rsquo;s also a human multi-player option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly playable on, and I think perhaps initially developed for, your phone. You can download it from the app stores for free and optionally choose to pay to be allowed to play as different tribes. But it&rsquo;s also there on Steam and some games consoles for the larger screen experience.</p>
<p>OK, it is Elon Musk&rsquo;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-lives-life-playing-222606578.html">favourite phone game</a>, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off.</p>

</ol>
<p>Some of those might explain a lot.  Don&rsquo;t worry though if you&rsquo;re a multiplayer fan. Apparently he had to stop playing at the point that he was so obsessed by it he started dreaming about it. By then it had <a href="https://gamingonphone.com/news/elon-musk-was-obsessed-with-the-battle-of-polytopia-mobile-game-reveals-his-recent-biography/">started making him late</a> for meetings and causing fights with his partner at the time, Grimes.</p>
<p>So far I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <em>entirely</em> drained me of empathy.</p>

			 <p>My Microsoft Surface laptop decided not to recognise that anything was plugged into its USB ports today. No idea why. But this meant I couldn&rsquo;t charge it or use the vast array of bits and pieces I have plugged into its dock. No amount of cable swapping or rebooting helped.</p>
<p>What eventually solved it, thanks to a tip from a colleague, was to shut down the laptop and unplug the USB-C cable. Then to hold the power button for 20 seconds until the Windows logo appeared, went away, and appeared once more. Once the computer finished loading up the USB-C charger and everything else that was plugged into it worked just fine.</p>
<p>No idea why it worked, but it did.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://www.thestudiesshowpod.com/">The Studies Show</a> podcast.</p>
<p>A couple of science writers I&rsquo;ve followed for a while, Tom Chivers and Stuart Ritchie, get together once a week to discuss some vaguely controversial scientific issue.</p>
<p>Are there studies supporting the clickbait headlines? What do the research papers cited by reporters and authors in support of a proposition actually say? Were they any good in the first place?</p>
<p>To give a flavour of what goes down, their first few episodes were about the GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs, breastfeeding, aspartame and psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not overly hard going. If you have a passing interest in reading newspaper science sections or popular science books then you&rsquo;ll do fine here.</p>
<p>What I have to call out for special credit is that the shownotes from each episode give the actual references and links to the papers they discuss. Of course this shouldn&rsquo;t be remarkable for a podcast that is entirely about scientific studies.  But there seem to be many other &lsquo;science&rsquo; shows out there that make it unnecessarily challenging to figure out exactly where they&rsquo;re pulling their information from that, even now, it&rsquo;s a real treat to see the sources shared up-front</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Last week, while checking the device of an individual employed by a Washington DC-based civil society organization with international offices, Citizen Lab found an actively exploited zero-click vulnerability being used to deliver NSO Group’s Pegasus mercenary spyware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">Citizen Lab reports</a> the discovery of the ominous sounding &lsquo;Blastpass&rsquo;. This is a bug in the operating system of most Apple devices that allows someone to infect your phone with spyware simply by messaging you a special image. The recipient doesn&rsquo;t have to click on anything.</p>
<p>It reminds me of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">that time in 2019</a> where users of WhatsApp on both iOS and Android devices could be infected via receiving a WhatsApp call, even if they didn&rsquo;t answer it.</p>
<p>Back then, a lawsuit alleged that at least 1400 people were subjected to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over an 11-day span in late April and early May, the suit alleges, NSO targeted about 1,400 mobile phones that belonged to attorneys, journalists, human-rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and senior foreign government officials</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to what the above implies, the feeling seems to be that probably for now if you&rsquo;re not someone being personally targeted by an extremely resourceful adversary then you&rsquo;re probably OK. But still, best to upgrade to iOS 16.6.1 or put your phone into <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212650">lockdown mode</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After winning the record for being <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/20/liz-truss-finally.html">the only UK Prime Minister</a> with a shorter lifespan than <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/21/so-the-lettuce.html">a lettuce</a> - and perhaps one of the most incompetent ones although the last few years have made that quite a competition - Liz Truss is back on the scene with a new book soon to come out called&hellip;drum roll&hellip;&quot;<a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/truss-newsworthy-debut-goes-to-biteback">Ten Years to Save the West</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>It sounds like it&rsquo;s exactly what you would guess from a title so trite and overdramatic it&rsquo;ll make your eyes roll right out of your face. Yes, despite the fact that the UK has had a ludicrously performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)">government of the right</a> for the past 13 - <a href="https://www.history.com/news/whats-so-unlucky-about-the-number-13">unlucky for some</a> -  years, apparently it&rsquo;s all those sneaky communists (?) that are ruining everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the rise of authoritarianism around the world and the adoption of fashionable ideas propagated by the global left give us barely a decade to preserve the economic and cultural freedom and institutions that the West holds so dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely unsurprisingly it seems like it&rsquo;ll contain a good amount of that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/vote-me-get-thatcher-why-the-tories-are-still-obsessed-with-the-iron-lady"> favourite hobby</a> of the modern-day Conservative cosplayer: heart-felt worship of Thatcher.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday <a href="https://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-12499369/Liz-Truss-reveal-inside-story-49-day-premiership-new-book-including-meeting-Queen-just-hours-monarch-died.html">shares an interview</a>, which even they seem to feel is a bit of a wild one at times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sitting incongruously beneath a picture of the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara bizarrely blended with Lord Nelson – a nod by Norfolk MP Ms Truss to the county’s most famous son – she launches a passionate defence of her own attempted revolution, which died when the markets crashed in the wake of her radical tax-cutting Budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was she such a failure? Not because, heaven forbid, she made any serious missteps in her short reign of power. It&rsquo;s <em>everyone else&rsquo;s</em> fault for not loving her ideas enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the fundamental problem was there wasn’t enough support for Conservative ideas&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from, once again, a very much majority Conservative government she was part of.</p>
<p>Tin foil hat time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the ‘global Left’ were in control. ‘Ideas like redistributionism, business being bad, the anti-growth people like Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil – those are the ideas that have made the running in the last decade,’ she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sure, everyone loves Extinction Rebellion and hates businesses too much. Those closet Commies are just&hellip;.something something&hellip;such that it simply <em>appears</em> that <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/explore/not-for-profit/Extinction_Rebellion">people dislike ER</a> and the British titans of business are getting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/07/ftse-100-executive-pay-rose-23-per-cent-4m-2022">unspeakably richer each day</a> whilst everyone else sits in a cost of living crisis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘You’ve got the global Left which Biden is obviously a key part of, but also the global environmental movement, the Greta Thunbergs of this world, the anti-capitalist movement, and they have been very effective in pushing what is politically acceptable.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I missed the news that Greta is the current PM of the UK and that capitalism has been overthrown. Presumably the state now owns the means of production I&rsquo;m typing this on. I mean, some would say that her desperate premiership did more than the rest of us combined to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism">discredit free market economics</a> and their animal spirits. They certainly didn&rsquo;t like her; the <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23007757.liz-truss-kwasi-kwarteng-wrecked-uk-economy-seven-days/">crashing of the British economy</a> being of course much of the reason she had to go.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also actively campaigning for &ldquo;a Republican&rdquo; to win the next US election, which is perhaps a little surprising after the fuss her treasured Boris made about &ldquo;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/472428-trump-well-aware-of-boris-johnsons-request-to-not-interfere-in-uk/">allies and friends&rdquo; getting involved</a> in each other&rsquo;s election campaigns.</p>
<p>Inevitably the typical new-levels-of-desperation-provoked Conservative fixation on US-style <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/liz-truss-diverse-cabinet-culture-war-unlike-any-other-1836651">culture war issues</a> raise their head. She&rsquo;s apparently terrified that the West is about to be destroyed whilst &ldquo;our culture is being questioned, even basic things like human biology&rdquo;. We all know what that means.</p>
<p>Mainly that it&rsquo;s probably only a matter of time before she starts a Substack and appears on multi-hour Qanon-adjacent podcasts to complain about terrible being cancelled was, albeit the kind of cancellation that involves &ldquo;the left&rdquo; mind-controlling you to choose to resign from literally running the country and write a book whilst earning <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-earns-16500-per-29784243">£16,500 per hour</a> for making speeches.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to Hell Is A Teenage Girl by <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1693992081">Nessa Barrett</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nessa is a Tiktok star. Perhaps a true emissary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z">Gen Z</a> with possibly the somewhat <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/nessa-barrett-interview-hell-is-a-teenage-girl-tiktok-religion-mental-health-cover-story">stereotypical Gen Z habits</a> of spending time staying in writing in her gratitude journal and doing tarot alongside her cat whilst releasing TikTok videos rather than the again stereotypical debauched and drunken lifestyles of such stars in former generations</p>
<p>Some of her ability to attract an incredible number of fans likely comes from her openness about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessa_Barrett#Personal_life">her mental health problems</a>. Sadly it sounds like she&rsquo;s suffered tremendously from a range of conditions.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also musically talented enough that posting her vids on TikTok led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>I think I read somewhere that the concept behind much of this EP is to enumerate the stages one goes through after a rough relationship breakup - the incompatible thoughts one might have: reminiscing, happy memories, disgust, hatred, caring nothing, caring too much. Aspects of it remind me of several other artists, from Taylor Swift to Girl In Red; the last song giving me the vibes a somewhat less intense version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh8Gl2GwB6s">Serotonin</a>.</p>

			 <p>Another day, another mass data-leak. The one that caught my attention most recently was that the details of 2.6 million <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> users were <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scraped-data-of-26-million-duolingo-users-released-on-hacking-forum/">for sale on hacking forums</a>. To be fair, it looks to be less &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; and more a product of misusing the DuoLingo API in order to collect data that could include people&rsquo;s real name, email address and some DuoLingo specifics such as what language the user was learning, as well as some profile settings.</p>
<p>Much of this except email address was technically &ldquo;public&rdquo; in that you could see it on a user&rsquo;s profile or at least access it via the API. But by feeding the API a big list of email addresses, probably obtained from some other leak, one could confirm their association with a DuoLingo account. This join to email gives an obvious opening for scammers to send accurately personalised spams or phishes - &ldquo;Hey, to continue your French lessons we need you to re-enter your credit card details here&rdquo; type stuff.</p>
<p>As it happens I <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2021/08/15/accessing-your-duolingo-data-for-analysis-via-python/">wrote about one way to programmatically access your data</a> from DuoLingo the past. But there I promise that I was more interested in the data of my on progress rather getting everyone&rsquo;s data to sell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only because <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/06/01/amazing-how-unproficient.html">I&rsquo;ve used DuoLingo</a> that this stood out to me I guess. It&rsquo;s far from the worst leak in recent times. Just this month we&rsquo;ve seen details of 40 million UK folk <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/08/turns-out-the.html">leak from the UK Electoral Commission</a>,  details of <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/discord-io-shut-down-data-breach-hacking-b1101000.html">760000 Discord.io users  released</a> (enough to <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/security/148221/discordio-temporarily-shuts-down-after-hack-promises-security-overhaul">shut the site down</a> for now) and 10 million French residents exposed via <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/10-million-likely-impacted-by-data-breach-at-french-unemployment-agency/">a leak from their government&rsquo;s unemployment registration agency</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s feeling ever more like if anything related to you is on any computer connected to the internet anywhere in some form other than heavily encrypted then you might consider it could potentially become public one day. In some cases <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/21/twitters-habit-of.html">even if you explicitly deleted it years ago</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008303365">Q</a> by Christina Dalcher.</p>
<p>Set in in a United States of the (near?) future, this book imagines a society where your status, what you&rsquo;re allowed to do, what access you have to things, even where you must be is governed by your &ldquo;Q&rdquo; score. Q is a kind of measure of intelligence, ability and moral worth. It can be thought of as an enhanced social credit score,  a quantified meritocracy.</p>
<p>Life can be very good for those with high Q. At least materially; the threat of losing one&rsquo;s position is of course ever-present. But the experience is grim for those who have been tarred with the brush of having a naturally low Q.</p>
<p>The book tells of the experience of Elena, a mother who has two children with very different Qs.</p>
<p>The story goes that she herself was very influential in the development of the Q system. The slightly incredible suggestion is that it originated from a system she and others got instigated at their school when they were students to help them cope with the relentless bullying in the before-times. Today though any concerns of bullying are gone; she&rsquo;s a respected lecturer, high Q. Her husband is a high-up government official largely in charge of managing the Q system. They lead an easy life of relative luxury. In some ways, the Q system is their doing and they certainly benefit from it.</p>
<p>Until they don&rsquo;t, or at least Elena doesn&rsquo;t. Her callous husband cares little for their child with insufficient Q. The powerful in society certainly don&rsquo;t care at all. But, hey, it&rsquo;s OK. Every child has a place. Trying not to spoil anything, it&rsquo;s just not a place Elena wants her child to go. And her new need to dig into the workings of the system lead her to discover the twisted goal it&rsquo;s taken on and the horrific methods that it uses to that end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a subtle book. There are plenty of vibes of things that exist today. The Chinese <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained">social credit system</a> comes to mind, as does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)#Plot">&ldquo;Nosedive&rdquo; Black Mirror episode</a>. More generally ,the pernicious inequalities foist upon us all depending on what the society you happen to be in today values and permits - witness the semi-panic in the recent AI hype cycle where folk with reasonably high-status jobs worry that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02?r=US&amp;IR=T#media-jobs-advertising-content-creation-technical-writing-journalism-2">they&rsquo;ll be replaced</a> with a computer - and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/new-index-of-economic-marginalisation-helps-explain-trump-brexit-and-alt-right-71172">politics that follows</a>..</p>
<p>The stratification of modern-day schooling and with a potential <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/17/11/when-testing-takes-over">over-emphasis on tests</a> is already a part of today&rsquo;s world in many places. As is a veneration of a meritocracy that doesn&rsquo;t really think through its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/06/michael-sandel-the-populist-backlash-has-been-a-revolt-against-the-tyranny-of-merit">more problematic consequences</a>. Genetic engineering and its consequent potential for selecting the attributes of future babies are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-era-of-designer-babies-may-be-based-on-overhyped-science/">work in progress</a>. And we should never forget the still frequently overlooked history of the role that eugenicists have played in the United States - &ldquo;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/03/24/521360544/the-supreme-court-ruling-that-led-to-70-000-forced-sterilizations">Three generations of imbeciles are enough</a>&rdquo; - and elsewhere, including of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics">most infamous instantiation of all</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I got to go experience the <a href="https://dreamachine.world/">Dream Machine</a> with a friend. The nature of the experience is such that I think it'&rsquo;ll be extraordinarily hard to convey via text, but I&rsquo;ll give it at least a weak go.</p>
<p>The overall conceit of the project is that when placed in a dark room, a mix of flashing lights and sounds can alter your conscious experience. Or rather it  &ldquo;invites you on a magical journey to explore the extraordinary potential of your mind&rdquo; to quote their website.</p>
<p>First up you start off in a room where past participants have attempted to draw what they experienced. You get to do the same when you&rsquo;re done, although my art skills are such that I didn&rsquo;t even try. Many of these pictures resemble colourful geometric patterns or bright fields of light. A handful appear to contain human-looking objects, perhaps aliens, that kind of thing, especially exciting to me. You can see some of these <a href="https://dreamachine.world/dream-grid/">pictures on their their website</a>. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next up they relieve you of your phone and other devices and, unexpectedly, your shoes. You&rsquo;re issued a bag that contains some hotel-style slippers, an eye mask and a blanket. There&rsquo;s a short safety talk to check everyone&rsquo;s willing and ready. The default experience is not suitable for people with sensitivity to flashing lights (precluding folk with some forms of epilepsy) or loud sounds. But they do have modified experiences available that should allow most people with those sensitivities to proceed if you let them know that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re led into a kind of inside tent with maybe 10-12 people to sit space d out on a large circular sofa type thing. The back of it is slanted such that you&rsquo;re half lying down. Two speakers surround your head. There&rsquo;s a big white spherical thing on the ceiling, which is the soon-to-be-flashing light. Your bag&rsquo;s blanket is for if you&rsquo;re a bit cold. The eye-mask is for you to put on if the experience starts to feel temporarily too much.</p>
<p>More safety briefing and confirmations that one is ready to proceed are given. Whilst the supervisors aren&rsquo;t going to be in the room with you when the experience starts they must be watching you I suppose as the deal is that if you need help you should wave and they&rsquo;ll come help you. All this is either a bit off-putting or a bit exciting depending your constitution, I definitely felt the latter.</p>
<p>Two key facts include that 1) you should keep your eyes shut throughout the experience if you can and 2) no matter what you think is going on out there they promise that all they&rsquo;re actually doing is flashing a white light at various intervals. Anything else you perceive is coming entirely from the mysterious world of your brain.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a little taster session just to make sure everyone is OK with the actual experience rather than a description of it. The room goes dark, you close your eyes and a prerecorded audio grounding starts. If you&rsquo;ve done certain types of meditation (including the app types) it&rsquo;s that kind of thing. Focus on your breath, your body, and so on. Then the sounds start, slightly ethereal music for the most part. And through your closed eyes you can tell the light must be turning on as a kind of brightness changes your eye-closed perception, similarly to how you know whether it&rsquo;s a sunny day or the middle of the night when you wake up each day but can&rsquo;t be bothered to open your eyes.</p>
<p>Then a few minutes of presumably flickering lights, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, wherein you get a taste of what&rsquo;s to come. The taster experience soon ends. The supervisors return and check that everyone is fine to proceed. Everyone was, so the main experience begins, again with the grounding.</p>
<p>This main course is a lot longer. I&rsquo;m not actually sure how long. Maybe 20 minutes? It&rsquo;s not like us humans are particularly good at keeping track of time in our heads even when at our most connected to stark reality, which in this experience is not really the case.</p>
<p>The sounds start, the light flashes, on and off, fast and slow, and your mind does what it does. Which in my case was mostly giving me visions of animated geometric patterns. Sometimes white, in line with the white light that we&rsquo;re told is the entirety of the external generative process. Sometimes not. Deep reds, yellows and oranges filled my inner eye at times.</p>
<p>These were usually organised into field-of-perceived-vision-encompassing dots, hexagons, and a repeating motif of diamonds. They zoomed in and out, they swirled, transitioning more intensely from one to another than even the best PowerPoint could. They exploded. They shrunk into nothingness. At first I felt just a little stressed or even nauseous perhaps, but it didn&rsquo;t last long and I relaxed into it to enjoy the perception show.</p>
<p>At one point I kind of felt like I saw a face in the centre of my vision - an alien? A God? Who knows? - but as much as I tried to focus and keep the glowing white visage present within the vision, the surrounding burning-white pulsating diamonds suddenly expanded and occluded the face within seconds.</p>
<p>So all in all, a lot was going on. Time flew, and I was not really ready to stop when unfortunately it was time for the experience to end. At that point you leave into a far more normal room with the possibility to draw something of your experience, write about it or just chat around a literal watercooler.</p>
<p>It was my friend&rsquo;s second time at this kind of show, so one of my immediate questions could be answered. Apparently no, you do not see the same thing each time you do it. And also, as intuitively would be the case, not everyone sees the same things. You are to be silent during the experience so there&rsquo;s no real way of communicating live what&rsquo;s going on in your head, and maybe it&rsquo;d ruin the experience if you tried to do so. But for sure we saw different things; deep blues for her if I remember correctly, reds for me. Assuming we mean the same things with the same words, that classical challenging <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/color/#H3">philosophical problem</a>. I expect humanity&rsquo;s inner mental lives are as diverse as their outer characteristics.</p>
<p>Tickets are currently £15 and you&rsquo;d need to get yourself to Hackney, London - everything you need to sign up is <a href="https://dreamachine.world/studio-dreamachine/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: apparently this was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/dreamachine-unboxed-brion-gysin-jon-hopkins-assemble">originally designed</a> as part of the Festival of Brexit (aka &ldquo;Unboxed&rdquo; but the former name is much funnier). It&rsquo;s not an original observation, but there are certainly plenty of folk out there who think that anything designed to alter your consciousness in any direction away from the grim reality of contemporary Britain is the best that we can really hope for to be fair. The Government&rsquo;s DCMS committee said the whole thing was an &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/brexit/952349/festival-of-brexit-unboxed">irresponsible use of public money</a>&rdquo;. The festival of course, not Brexit, definitely not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much earlier inspiration <a href="https://dreamachine.world/about/">comes from</a> work by an artist called <a href="https://www.briongysin.com/">Brion Gysin</a>. In 1959 he made a much smaller device that used flickering light to create &ldquo;vivid illusions&rdquo; in the minds of those who experienced it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of it taken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gatewood">Charles Gatewood</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Gysin designed it after noticing that the flickering of sunlight when driving through trees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/dreamachine-unboxed-brion-gysin-jon-hopkins-assemble">put him into a somewhat hallucinatory state</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dreamachine would awaken humanity, Gysin hoped, from cultural stupefaction and liberate us from being passive consumers of mass-produced imagery. Gysin hoped it would replace every TV in every home in the US and make us creators of our own cinematic experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might surprise you to learn that that&rsquo;s not quite what ended up happening. But I&rsquo;m glad its derivatives are still around for us to experience all these years later.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/08/27/the-trials-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-08-27 16:05:54 &#43;0100">Aug 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past couple of days I&rsquo;ve managed to install <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/07/the-call-of.html">Linux Mint</a> onto my Windows 10 computer. The last straw for Windows was when <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224805/the-start-menu-should-be-sacred-but-its-still-a-disaster-in-windows-10/">it advertised</a> some story about how great Wetherspoons is to me when all I wanted to do was open some software. My computer also is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/">prohibited by Microsoft</a> from upgrading to Windows 11 (it is old&hellip;but runs Windows 10 just fine) so at some point in the possibly distant future I imagine that could have caused me a problem. I&rsquo;d also like to move more and more towards open source software, at least for my personal computing.</p>
<p>Below is what I did. It didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as I&rsquo;d hoped to be honest. I probably made it more difficult than I needed to for myself to be fair, and Windows played tricks on me too. But in the end it seems to be working well I&rsquo;m writing it here in case I need to do it again or someone else encounters the same obstacles.</p>
<p>So there are various ways you can install Linux Mint on a computer that currently has Windows on it. That includes starting afresh, deleting everything you already have, Windows and all, and going 100% Linux. You can also use Linux Mint inside Windows using a virtual machine without having to do anything to Windows - it acts just like another piece of software you install in Windows, but has the obvious memory and processing overhead of having to run Windows and Linux simultaneously. You can also use it entirely from a USB drive. But I chose to go with probably the trickiest of options dual-booting.</p>
<p>The idea here is that in the end what should happen is that each time my computer turns on it gives me a menu letting me choose whether I want to use Windows or Linux. I thus can choose between Windows and Linux each run and they&rsquo;ll act independently of each other. The natural cost is that you need to dedicate a certain amount of disk space to both operating systems and any files you want to use in them - but it&rsquo;s better than having to buy a whole new computer. It&rsquo;s also proved more tricky to set up than I imagine the other options would have been, although I do lay some of the blame at Windows' feet whilst  sucking up a decent chunk of it as being down to my own ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="get-and-validate-the-linux-mint-install-software">Get and validate the Linux Mint install software</h2>
<p>Step 1 was to <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/choose.html">download</a> the ISO file containing the Linux Mint image I wanted to install. I went with the &ldquo;Cinnamon 64bit&rdquo; version. Also get the sha256sum.txt and sha256sum.txt.gpg files from relevant Linux Mint download page (<a href="https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=305">this</a> was the edition I used) which lets us verify the integrity of the ISO file later.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, verify the file by comparing hashes. I only had access to Windows so per <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;t=291093">these instructions</a> I downloaded <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> - the &ldquo;Simple installer for the current Gnu PG&rdquo; from <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then to check the integrity if the ISO:</p>
<p>Open a command prompt (PowerShell) in the folder I downloaded those to and ran 
<code>CertUtil -hashfile linuxmint-21.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso SHA256</code></p>
<p>Check that the results matched the sha256sum.txt file.</p>
<p>To check authenticity:</p>
<p>Run <code>gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 --recv-key 27DEB15644C6B3CF3BD7D291300F846BA25BAE09</code></p>
<p>Then:
<code>gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt</code></p>
<p>And check that the output says &ldquo;Good signature from &ldquo;Linux Mint ISO Signing Key <a href="mailto:root@linuxmint.com">root@linuxmint.com</a>&rdquo; and the primary key fingerprint at the bottom matches the 27DE&hellip;. code from the first <code>gpg</code> output. Don&rsquo;t worry about the warning about the key not being certified.</p>
<h2 id="make-a-bootable-linux-usb-stick">Make a bootable Linux USB stick</h2>
<p>Now we need to to make a bootable USB stick from the ISO image. First find a USB disk you don&rsquo;t mind emptying out as this will remove any existing files on it. After that, <a href="https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/burn.html">here are the instructions</a>.  For Windows they suggest you install <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Etcher</a>. I downloaded Etcher for Windows Portable Edition but presumably any should work.</p>
<p>In Etcher, choose to &ldquo;Flash from file&rdquo; and select the ISO image you downloaded in the first step.
Then &ldquo;Select Target&rdquo; to choose your USB drive (after plugging it in, and remembering that you&rsquo;ll lose any data on it). Then select to flash the drive and wait a few minutes until it’s finished.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-disk-space-for-linux-to-install-to">Prepare disk space for Linux to install to</h2>
<p>Next up we&rsquo;ll need to create a partition for Linux Mint to install to. Probably your disk is already partitioned 100% for Windows. I needed to reduce the size of the Windows partition and create a new one with space from Linux.</p>
<p>Although the instructions for Linux Mint read to me like you can do this during the Linux Mint install process, most of the info I read on the internet suggested to do it first in Windows, with the Windows specific tool, given you&rsquo;re messing around with a Windows partition. This is &ldquo;fiddling around with hard disks&rdquo; type stuff, so everyone recommends that you back up anything important before doing it just in case either you or Windows does it wrong and lose it all.</p>
<p>Then I did the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the built-in app &ldquo;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help-in-disk-management-ad88ba19-f0d3-0809-7889-830f63e94405">Disk Management</a>&rdquo; in Windows - one way to get to this is open the Start Menu and start typing &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; until the option to &ldquo;Create and format hard disk partitions&rdquo; comes up.</li>
<li>Right click the disk you want to &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; in order to make a Linux partition. For me this was the one labelled &ldquo;C:&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;Shrink volume&rdquo;</li>
<li>It asks you to input the &ldquo;amount of space to shrink&rdquo; in MB. I decided to give Linux 100GB to use for now so typed in 100000 and clicked &ldquo;Shrink&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A while later the Disk Management screen updated to show a 97.66GB unallocated space. Seems like I should have remembered that 100000 MB doesn&rsquo;t necessarily equal 100 GB if I wanted rounder numbers. But this will do for now.</li>
<li>Note that of course whatever you &ldquo;unallocate&rdquo; here won&rsquo;t be accessible to Windows. So you need to have a decent amount of free disk space to go this dual boot way.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reboot-from-your-usb-drive">Reboot from your USB drive</h2>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to boot up the bootable USB we created and install Linux into this free space.</p>
<p>First I checked the BIOS to make sure my computer could boot from a USB. For my old Sony laptop this meant turning it off and then holding down the special button marked &ldquo;ASSIST&rdquo; and choosing &ldquo;Start from media&rdquo;. For most less weirdly proprietary computers I think that&rsquo;s usually case of looking at your <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Computer-BIOS-Settings">BIOS settings</a> to make sure your computer is set to boot from USB drive before your hard disk and then rebooting it.</p>
<p>Start it up again with the USB drive you prepared earlier plugged in. If you set the boot options correctly you will get a menu. I chose &lsquo;Start Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon 64-bit&rsquo;’'.</p>
<h2 id="start-the-linux-mint-installation-wizard">Start the Linux Mint installation wizard</h2>
<p>After a few minutes and some slightly scary looking error messages I ignored it loaded up to a Linux Mint desktop. I double clicked the Install Linux Mint icon.</p>
<p>In the subsequent wizards, select your language, keyboard. I chose the option to ‘Install multimedia codecs’ which meant I had to configure secure boot by choosing a password as  I apparently have UEFI secure boot enabled.</p>
<p>I think this stage later gave me problems. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure this is why but I read somewhere that your keyboard will effectively be in US mode at the time of needing this password. So if you have a non-US keyboard then you might want to make the password pretty simple and not full of special characters. Letters and numbers worked for me. Note that you only need to use this password once.</p>
<p>Next up in the install wizard, I chose &ldquo;Install Linux mint alongside windows boot manager&rdquo;. A message popped up explaining what changes it was going to make. It wasn’t all that helpful. But I <em>think</em> it did everything OK.  There is a &ldquo;Something else&rdquo; option if you prefer to try and manually figure out / exert some control your partitions. Most internet guides seem to recommend that, but I must admit I did the &ldquo;install alongside&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>Next up I chose my time zone, and chose a username, password, computer name and chose to encrypt my home folder. This password is the one you&rsquo;ll use to log onto Linux Mint every time so make sure you can remember it. The system then started to install.</p>
<p>I then let it restart the computer, removing the USB when it told me too.</p>
<h2 id="manage-your-moks-">Manage your MOKs (?)</h2>
<p>A blue &ldquo;MOK management&rdquo; screen appeared. I had no idea what this meant. I think what I should have done was to choose the &ldquo;Enroll MOK&rdquo; which was the second option I was presented with, view the key and choose to &ldquo;Enroll key&rdquo;. The password is the first password we recorded above, the one to do with the multimedia codecs.</p>
<p>However I had little idea what any of this meant so by the time I got to it it had timed out and automatically picked the first option which was to continue the normal boot process. This loaded up Linux Mint but I&rsquo;m led to believe this meant the multimedia codecs and maybe some other stuff wouldn&rsquo;t work. You really want to enroll the MOK.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a one time prompt - reboot and you&rsquo;ll not get a chance to enroll the MOK key again. Oh no! But there is a way to reset this and get the MOK key prompt to come back.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-mok-enrollment-screen-to-come-back-if-like-me-you-did-it-wrong-the-first-time">Getting the MOK enrollment screen to come back if like me you did it wrong the first time</h3>
<p>Thank you to Philip from the 11th post <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/701448">here</a> who documented that if you load up to Linux and type this into the command prompt:</p>
<p><code>sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der</code></p>
<p>Then the next time you restart you&rsquo;ll get that option to Enroll MOK again. Running the above will ask perhaps for your &ldquo;root&rdquo; password which is the second one you selected above and then for you to define a new password. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of the one-use first password we encountered above with the multimedia codecs. So probably make it fairly simple. It won&rsquo;t affect the password you log onto your computer with. But it&rsquo;s this one-use password you use to enroll your MOK.</p>
<p>If feeling particularly committed, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot">this page</a> describes a bit more about what these keys and commands are for. If your computer isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; with SecureBoot then you may not see any of this.</p>
<p>After that, all seemed well. Whenever I turned my computer on I could choose between Linux and Windows just like I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-the-internet">Connecting to the internet</h2>
<p>At first the wifi didn&rsquo;t work, but once I went into the built-in Driver Manager in Linux Mint and inserted my install USB key when prompted. It scanned, found my wireless card, and when I selected the only option it gave me other than &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it&rdquo; that all started working well.</p>
<h2 id="when-windows-forcibly-takes-over-again">When Windows forcibly takes over again</h2>
<p>I was glowing with success only for a few minutes until Windows turned nasty&hellip;.The first time I chose to load Windows it appeared to overwrite the startup menu where you choose between Linux and Windows. Apparently this is pretty normal. I guess Windows just can&rsquo;t believe that you don&rsquo;t want to 100% use it and its extremely undesirable Start Menu.</p>
<p>So whilst I&rsquo;d successfully installed Linux Mint, after the first time I&rsquo;d loaded up Windows I wasn&rsquo;t given the option to actually use Linux ever again. Aaargh.</p>
<p>The internet has a vast array of frustrated users and posts with helpful suggestions about what lengthy thing you should type in to where to hopefully sort this problem out. But not a single one of the ones I saw quite worked for me. However they did provide enough clues that I think I eventually got to  the bottom of it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I fully understand everything I did here, and it&rsquo;s probably not very risk free for anyone with no backup, but here&rsquo;s what worked for me in case I ever need it again. Honestly though, unless you understand it better than me I wouldn&rsquo;t run it without having a great backup, a bit more research or an expert friend.</p>
<p>First up, you&rsquo;ll need to get back into Linux however you can (remember you can most likely boot from your install USB if you&rsquo;ve no other way). Then open the command prompt (aka terminal) and run:</p>
<p><code>efibootmgr -v</code></p>
<p>I got a list showing the partitions that could boot and thee order that they&rsquo;d apparently do so in. One row for Windows and a couple for &ldquo;Ubuntu&rdquo;. One of these rows was my main Linux Mint install. The other is &ldquo;grub&rdquo; which is the menu system that lets you choose which OS to start when you turn your computer. Windows kept insisting on enabling itself and acting like it was first on the list no matter what I did whereas I needed the grub one to take precedence. The intuitive thing of &ldquo;change the boot order to the order you want it to be in&rdquo; did not help.</p>
<p>So I noted down the filenames each of these entries were associated withl- the parts starting:
<code>/File(\EFI\....</code></p>
<p>The Windows one in my case was the file:
<code>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi</code></p>
<p>The &ldquo;grub&rdquo; one was:
<code>\EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi</code></p>
<p>The Linux Mint one was:
<code>\EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi</code></p>
<p>Then, shutdown Linux, turn your computer off.</p>
<p>Reboot this time loading Windows (which is probably what will happen anyway given the issue we&rsquo;re trying to solve here).</p>
<p>Open the Windows command prompt in administrator mode (which means to hold Shift and right click it and choose &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo; rather than simply double-clicking it) and type this mystical incantation into it:</p>
<p><code>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi</code></p>
<p>Presumably if you saw something other than \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi when you ran <code>efibootmgr</code> in the previous step then you should put what you saw relating to grub at the end of the <code>bcdedit</code> command rather than copying me exactly.</p>
<p>That said it completed successfully. And since then every time I restarted my computer it&rsquo;s offered me the choice of which operating system to run exactly as it did before Windows greedily overwrote whatever I&rsquo;d done in the first place.</p>
<p>If you decide you did want Windows to just load every time without prompting you could undo the above command by just specifying the Windows bootloader instead of the grub one I think:</p>
<p><code>bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\bootmgfw.efi</code> in my case.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>An important point for any debate about treatments for obesity that&rsquo;s often missed or downplayed in certain media takes is that obesity appears to be causally associated with a range of other extremely serious health issues, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27146380/">an early death</a>.</p>
<p>As one example, in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23812">recent review</a>, Pati et al found that 4-8% of all cancers could be attributed to obesity, even if we don&rsquo;t precisely know why that is yet. Having obesity also makes for worse outcomes in general if you do get cancer.</p>
<p>That study ended with a call to collect more data on cancer outcomes regarding the less traditional forms of obesity treatments; surgical interventions and pharmacological. As it happens, earlier this year <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23812">a new study</a> on the former was published. Adams et al find that bariatric surgery patients ended up having a 25% lower risk of developing cancer later on than their peers, along with a 43% lower risk to die from cancer.</p>
<p>A new RCT study that looks at the outcomes of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1">GLP-1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-obesity_medication">anti-obesity</a> drugs that have taken some quarters of the world by storm, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide">Semaglutide</a>, is going to be presented soon. In the mean time, a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/08/2720343/0/en/Novo-Nordisk-A-S-Semaglutide-2-4-mg-reduces-the-risk-of-major-adverse-cardiovascular-events-by-20-in-adults-with-overweight-or-obesity-in-the-SELECT-trial.html">press release</a> has revealed some of the top-level effects. People with overweight or obesity who were treated with Semaglutide had a 20% reduction in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_adverse_cardiovascular_events">major adverse cardiovascular events</a>, including heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular-related deaths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll not know the full details until the full study is published but, assuming the full study is deemed legitimate and in general reflects the headline, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with the CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition who is quoted by the <a href="https://conscienhealth.org/2023/08/huge-news-semaglutide-cuts-deaths-cv-events-in-obesity/">ConscienHealth</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semaglutide for obesity is a life-saving medicine for a serious chronic disease. It is now crystal clear that making excuses to deny people the care they need for obesity is unethical.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treatments for obesity are not about personal vanity, body shaming or anything along those lines. Sure, they can be misrepresented or misused, but so can a wide range of other less &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; medical treatments. But at the end of they day they are potentially life saving interventions and should be treated as such.</p>

			 <p>Following on having been inappropriately surprised that a person with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a> (DID) might be allergic to orange juice <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/08/17/when-only-one.html">whilst under control of some personalities</a> but not others, I&rsquo;ve now learned that it&rsquo;s possible for some personalities to be blind when others are not.</p>
<p>Here we have <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26468893/">a report of a patient known as B.T.</a> She seemed to have been blinded as the result of an accident, and got the appropriate medical tests and later diagnosis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_blindness">cortical blindness</a> as a result of damage to her brain.</p>
<p>She also had DID. Imagine everyone&rsquo;s surprise a few years later, being of the chronological age of 37 years old, when at the times when the personality of a teenage boy was in control <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/11/24/the-blind-woman-who-switched-personalities-and-could-suddenly-see/">she could see</a> well enough to read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that B.T. had just <em>reported</em> not being able to see for years. Brain tests showed that when in other personalities the areas of her brain associated with visual stimuli didn&rsquo;t react to input at all, as one would only expect in anyone unable to see . But when in the personality that was able to see, the sight processing areas of the brain started to light up again.</p>
<p>Over time, with training, most of her other personalities learned to see again, although two remain blinded.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;d totally missed that there&rsquo;s a substantial amount of landing-on-the-moon activity going on at present. Most recently Russia&rsquo;s attempt to be the first to land a craft, &ldquo;Luna-25&rdquo;, on the southern polar region of the moon - despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">everything else</a> that one imagines the administration of that country would be focussing on right now.</p>
<p>That region of the moon is unexplored by landers. It&rsquo;s thought that there might be interesting ice deposits to examine there. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole">the only area</a> of the moon that has craters with interiors that aren&rsquo;t near-constantly in sunlight.</p>
<p>We do know what the moon&rsquo;s south pole looks like from above though thanks to several successful orbital missions. Here&rsquo;s an image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However the Luna-25 landing didn&rsquo;t go well. As of yesterday it has officially &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-luna-25-crash-landing-moon/">ceased to exist</a>&rdquo; as a result of crashing into the moon.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an artist&rsquo;s impression of what it would have looked like if it <em>had</em> touched down in 1 piece, taken from the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-luna-25-crash-landing-moon/">CBS article above</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unfortunately, given the impact of the craft crashing into the moon&rsquo;s surface, an artist&rsquo;s impression is all we can expect from that mission.</p>
<p>India is attempting something similar with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3">Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft</a>, due to land on the moon this week. In the US, NASA is funding a commercial attempt to land on the moon from <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/">Intuitive Machines</a> later this year. Another commercial offering, this time from <a href="https://www.astrobotic.com/">Astrobotic</a>, is expected this or next year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Lunar_Exploration_Program">China</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Polar_Exploration_Mission">Japan</a> are also involved in moon-landing missions expected to take place over the next few years.</p>
<p>Most of these are put-robots-on-moon missions. However <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">NASA&rsquo;s Artemis program</a> has a moon landing planned for 2025 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program">Artemis 3</a> - that is looking to drop a couple of human astronauts near the lunar south pole.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the latest reminder that things you upload to the various big social media services aren&rsquo;t yours and can&rsquo;t be relied on to stay there forever, it seems like Twitter has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/08/19/twitter-deletes-all-user-photos-and-links-from-2011-2014/">removed all the photos</a> and some of the links that folk posted on it between 2011-2014.</p>
<p>No-one seems to know if it&rsquo;s deliberate or not,. The email address the press might contact to find out is still responding with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/23/twitter-elon-musk-poop-emoji">poo emoji</a>.</p>
<p>The forthcoming change to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66550959">prevent you from blocking users</a> is however all-too-deliberate, which is an absolutely wild thing to do imo given some of the content I understand remains on there.</p>
<p>Somehow deleting 4 years of potentially treasured photos still seems on average less bad to me than a previous Twitter shenanigan that resulted in posts that you would justifiably assumed were deleted- because you personally deleted them a long time ago so why would they even still exist anywhere? - <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/deleted-twitter-messages-are-reappearing-for-some-users/">magically re-appeared once more</a>. That one was probably down to incompetence rather than malice. But whatever cause it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine all sorts of potential bad consequences,  embarrassing, awkward or devastating arising, from that.</p>
<p>Whilst Twitter is the current exemplar of these kind of bad practices, seemingly largely because of who runs now runs it, there&rsquo;s little reason to believe that the potential risks are all that much reduced with its competitors either. The sad fact that if you don&rsquo;t own the means of computation then you can&rsquo;t rely on it - admittedly to vastly varying extents - is highlighted here once again.</p>
<p>At the very least, it&rsquo;s a reminder to re-learn the old lessons of backing up everything we care about and being super careful to never share anything there&rsquo;s a chance we might not want to be publicly available in the future. In the real world, both are of course easier said than done.</p>

			 <p>📧 Reading <a href="https://johnmedina.substack.com/">John Medina&rsquo;s Substack</a> newsletter. He&rsquo;s a developmental molecular biologist, and author of <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780996032605">Brain Rules</a>. Each newsletter I&rsquo;ve seen so far usually provides a quick summary of something unusual, occasionally jaw-dropping, about the human brain, how it works, what it does.</p>
<p><a href="https://johnmedina.substack.com/p/john-medinas-brain-rules-2b0">Issue 25</a> was one that stood out to me. It told the story of &ldquo;Timmy&rdquo;, one of the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo;  that a patient with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder">Dissociative Identity Disorder</a> (aka DID, previously referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder) had.</p>
<p>Over time his body would appear to be inhabited by one of around 12 different personalities, if that&rsquo;s the right word. Some of his personalities were allergic to orange juice. If he drank whilst one of these was active then his skin swelled up, became red and developed hives. This is not so unusual, people often have allergic reactions.</p>
<p>The twist is that some of his other personalities did not have this allergy. If they were in charge of his inner show at the time of drinking a glass of juice then his body wouldn&rsquo;t show any of those symptoms. No sign of any allergy was to be found.</p>
<p>If he switched from a personality that was allergic to the juice to one that wasn&rsquo;t in the middle of undergoing an allergic reaction then his hives, redness and itching would simply disappear.</p>
<p>It thus became apparent that what&rsquo;s usually assumed to be a physical, deterministic, response to a chemical is in fact context dependent. Whilst no-one thinks we usually consciously &ldquo;create&rdquo; our allergic reactions, this suggests that something somewhere in our brain must unconsciously be governing them. Hence there&rsquo;s a sense in which they are under our control, existing in relation to us rather than simply being an inanimate &ldquo;fact of the universe&rdquo; - even if we don&rsquo;t know to how to consciously leverage them</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in the mind&rdquo; is a phrase that often used derogatorily, unsympathetically and dismissively to patients suffering various conditions, as if suffering situated primarily in the workings of the mind was somehow of lesser concern than suffering entirely on overtly physical phenomena. But stories like this constantly keep me wondering to what extent almost anything of note is at least somewhat &ldquo;in the mind&rdquo;. The book &ldquo;<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/finished-reading-the.html">The Expectation Effect</a>&rdquo; added a ton of counterintuitive examples towards that end.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141014081">The Complete Maus</a> by Art Spiegelman.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a comic book portraying the author&rsquo;s difficult conversations with his father about the father&rsquo;s experience as a Polish Jew in the Second World War. Harrowingly, but far from uncommonly, the experience included time imprisoned at concentration camps, including the infamous Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Most of the people he knew, most of the characters in the book, ended up dying at the hands of the Nazis. They are shot, hung or, more frequently, the victims of a long, slow, tortuous death journey of absolute neglect from captors who do not see you as human.</p>
<p>Actually the book doesn&rsquo;t portray almost anyone as human, not in literal terms. Whilst the concepts of humanity and inhumanity infuse the story throughout, visually the participants are portrayed as cartoon animals. The Jews are anthropomorphic cartoon mice. Their former gentile country people, occasionally later collaborators, as pigs and the Nazis are cats. And the language is at times rough, ungrammatical, unrefined.</p>
<p>Out of context this might seem to be a strange or trivialising approach to the most awful of events. But in reality the stark black and white illustrative loses none of, and perhaps draws us into, the horror of what transpired. It pulls no punches. The frank representations of what went on maintain their  visceral impact.</p>
<p>As Spiegelman once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe vulgar, semiliterate, unsubtle comic books are an appropriate form for speaking of the unspeakable</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/the-making-of-maus.html">This exchange</a> sums it up the criticisms along those lines succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that a comic book about Auschwitz is in bad taste?&rdquo; one angry reporter asked him when the book was published in Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Spiegelman replied, &ldquo;I thought Auschwitz was in bad taste.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The father, the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; who survived the horrors, is a complicated character. He&rsquo;s on at least his second marriage and it&rsquo;s not going well. He&rsquo;s miserly, grumpy, demanding, with unpleasant views, whether shaped by his experience of things no human should every experience or otherwise. He&rsquo;s demanding, an incessant. His son, the author finds him hard to be around, wants to avoid him, to get away even as he becomes increasingly unwell. The book switches between the father&rsquo;s story of life in the war back to the present day life and its many tensions until both are resolved, one way or another.</p>
<p>The book - the only graphic novel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_award-winning_graphic_novels">ever win a Pulitzer Prize</a> at the time of writing -  became more famous in recent times following a ban on it by a Tennessee school board, ostensibly <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/02/the-inside-story-of-the-banning-of-maus-its-dumber-than-you-think/">for its bad language</a> and a tangential depiction of nudity. In it&rsquo;s time the book has also been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/art-spiegelman-russia-maus-bookstores-holocaust">banned in Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/maus-art-spiegelman-book-ban-anti-semitism/672203/">burned in Poland</a>.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the in reality the Tennessee action was nothing more than a continuation of the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/banning-maus-warning-not-only-195228313.html">politically driven book-banning</a> so favoured by the supposed freedom-loving political right of the US. At the very least, I worry about the mind and priorities of anyone who thinks the most disturbing thing about this book is the occasional mild swear words.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the sort of disturbing that is important that humanity never forgets, never thinks can only happen once, only in the past. &lsquo;Never again, and again and again&rsquo; to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/11/maus-art-spiegelman-book-ban-anti-semitism/672203/">quote the author</a>.</p>

			 <p>📽 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/interstate-60-2002">Interstate 60</a>.</p>
<p>Fun coming-of-age-roadtrip type movie about a young man who is torn between following the life he wants as an artist vs the life his rich father and girlfriend should want, as a lawyer with a fancy red car.</p>
<p>After suffering an injury he ends up in a hospital where he learns that everything is perception, and perception isn&rsquo;t necessarily reality. Somehow this gets him into a parcel-delivery mission down a non-existent highway, accompanied at times by a unusual genital-free man who grants peoples' wishes for better or worse - shades of a much more relaxed and horror-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishmaster_(film)">Wishmaster</a> - via smoking a weird monkey-shaped pipe. Guided by an extremely prescient Magic 8-ball and visions of a lady only he can see, he sets out to delivery his parcel and of course along the way make those all-important life decisions.</p>
<p>Whilst this might imply existential wrangling, it&rsquo;s pretty much light-hearted fun and games in this case. It&rsquo;s written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Gale">Bob Gale</a> who also co-wrote Back to the Future. A couple of the same actors appear - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> who was Back to the Future&rsquo;s Doc Brown, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox">Michael J. Fox</a> who of course was Marty McFly, and it often has similar kinds of vibes.</p>
<p>A lot more enjoyable than I first expected given I&rsquo;d never heard of it before.</p>

			 <p>The clowns are at it again. When Sunak <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/24/another-day-another.html">took over the British premiership</a> from the last Conservative mess of a Prime Minister, someone who must have set some kind of record for their damage-to-tenure ratio, I did have a little hope that he would at least try and be the &ldquo;sensible adult in the room&rdquo; that was promised. No hope at all that he&rsquo;d come up with thoughtful or progressive policies, but maybe at least he&rsquo;d manage to be some kind of boring technocrat before losing the next general election.</p>
<p>I guess I was wrong. It seems like he wants the next election to be fought over the issue of which party can promise to damage the environment the most, with a side-helping of who can make the roads as dangerous as possible for us, their valued citizens. My fear is Labour will actually sign up to that battle, throwing away the last remnants of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html">the only policies of theirs I positively liked</a> to the wind. &ldquo;The wind&rdquo; of course being the next devastating hurricane the ongoing climate catastrophe <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1128221">summons up</a>.</p>
<p>A few days ago he was promoting his slightly 2017-robot-disguised-as-human visage via a <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1685582472262602752">photo of him</a> supposedly sitting in Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s old car.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Inevitably this turned out to be another lie, albeit probably an accidental one, insomuch as the car he was sitting in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gaffe-prone-rishi-sunak-mocked-30591650">was not in fact Thatcher&rsquo;s vehicle</a>, but rather one that her protection squad used.</p>
<p>Sunak of course has form for pretending he&rsquo;s in other people&rsquo;s cars for PR reasons, namely the famous incident him filling up his Kia with post-tax-cut petrol that in fact <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/rishi-sunak-used-sainsburys-employees-car-for-petrol-filling-photo-op_uk_623c7038e4b019fd8138588f">wasn&rsquo;t his Kia</a>.  At least it shows he has wherewithal to feel some tension between showing off his own extremely expensive fleet of cars and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-helicopter-travel-ulez-b2384489.html">unnecessary helicopters</a> and appearing as, same as they all want to pretend to be, yawn, &ldquo;a man of the people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, why was he polluting the media-waves pretending to be in Thatcher&rsquo;s car? Well a part of it was no doubt the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pm-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tory-party-chasing-the-ghost-of-margaret-thatcher/">weird obsession</a> many of the wannabe Conservative movers-and-shakers and their acolytes have with their former Prime Minister who it must be said did actually manage to get things done. The wrong things, sure, but <em>things</em>.  Things with even more impact than the best of today&rsquo;s cabinet sponsored warm-take cringe-tweet.</p>
<p>But also following the only Conservative hold in the recent &ldquo;Day Of 3-Byelections&rdquo;, the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-suffers-by-election-bruising-but-avoids-clean-sweep-of-defeats-12924593">Uxbridge result</a> where they managed to lose only around 93% of their previous majority, it&rsquo;s been decided by all and sundry that the reason they won was because they campaigned against the &ldquo;ULEZ&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite it&rsquo;s name, the ULEZ is not a species of war-mongering aliens, but rather the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">Ultra Low Emission Zone</a>. It&rsquo;s a London based policy whereby if you have a vehicle that emits above <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">a certain threshold</a> of polluting emissions then you have to pay £12.50 a day to drive it within the specified zone.  The zone now includes Uxbridge after the (Labour) Mayor of London extended its scope. So this was admittedly potentially going to get pretty expensive for folk who have cause to regularly drive. Labour seems to agree, with their leader, Kier Starmer, deciding he&rsquo;s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/21/starmer-urges-khan-to-reflect-on-ulez-rules-after-uxbridge-defeat">against it</a>.</p>
<p>It seems a reasonable criticism that making people with with non-compliant cars pay probably biases the charges towards older cars, which in turn means that the average owner might likely be poorer than someone with a newer, compliant, car (but much richer than someone with no car, plus not all new cars are compliant). Whether the charge will be tilted towards folk with a lesser ability to afford to pay it or not is a factual matter. I&rsquo;m sure someone has looked into it. And if it is, and it&rsquo;s seen as unfair, then sure, let&rsquo;s dream up a new policy that actually gets at what we really want to do here - which is to protect the environment, rather than let people pay to damage the environment.</p>
<p>But somehow the issue of a certain constituency saying they don&rsquo;t like a very specific fairly punitive-at-the-individual-level scheme has developed into the idea that all pro-environmental policies are evil. Hence the Sunak tweet, sitting in his fake car, &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; (cringe) blasting out how he&rsquo;s the true motorist&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just bad tweets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ordered <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66351785">a review</a> of all current low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs). Despite the fact in reality <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular">they&rsquo;re quite popular</a>, even if Conservative MP Nick Fletcher does believe them to be an &ldquo;international socialist concept&rdquo;, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters is that no-one knows what LTN even means. Depending on the definition taken, there may be more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/16/critics-of-uk-low-traffic-schemes-told-that-25000-filters-already-existed">25,000</a> of them. Their main use is to stop a torrent of traffic ripping its way through narrow residential streets. Pedestrians and cyclists can pass freely, and cars can still access the streets in order reach any destination within the area - but they&rsquo;re generally blocked in a way that stops you motoring your way right through a city entirely on the small, easily clogged, heavily pedestrian oriented streets where children play and suchlike.</p>
<p>In a further bid to lionise the act of speeding tons of metal through inappropriate routes, ministers are also apparently thinking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-councils-20mph-speed-limit-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns">restrict councils' freedom</a> to create 20 miles per hour speed limits. The <a href="https://www.roadpeace.org/">RoadPeace charity</a> is amongst many other interested parties who express sentiments along the lines of being &ldquo;extremely disappointed to see roads made demonstrably less safe.”</p>
<p>Central government imposing these restrictions on council decisions - I guess Sunak stopped &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; right after he left the photo-op - might not actually be be legal under current legislation. They might have to change the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/27/contents">1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act</a> to go ahead with this.</p>
<p>These things are also important for reasons outside of environmental emissions, and in fact aren&rsquo;t necessarily even targeted at improving our atmosphere in that way. As Devi Sridhar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/04/uk-must-follow-europe-lead-prioritising-walking-cycling-public-transport">recently summarised</a>, this stuff is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;not about banning cars, but about making it cheaper and simpler to replace short-distance single occupancy journeys with alternatives that have far-reaching benefits for the city’s inhabitants and the planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those benefits include staying alive. The ultimate freedom, if we must. It was a campaign group whose name translates to &ldquo;Stop The Child Murder&rdquo; that helped compel the Dutch government to make their cities less car focussed. Over 400 children died in traffic accidents over there in 1971. Now it&rsquo;s more like 17 per year.</p>
<p>Over here in the UK, last year <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/slowing-city-traffic-cuts-road-deaths-by-a-quarter-study-shows/31621">a study</a> found that reducing the speed limit in the city of Edinburgh to 20 mph - the very thing that the government is rumoured to oppose - reduced road deaths by 23%, serious injuries by 33% and collisions by 40%. &ldquo;Livability&rdquo;, things such as safety, health, sustainability and living standards also improved, as did the number of people who supported and were willing to obey the new limits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discerningcyclist.com/which-city-has-the-most-cyclists-statistics/">majority of Dutch people</a> are cyclists now, making them the one of the most physically active populations around according to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/dutch-are-most-physically-active-nation-brazilians-are-least#:~:text=A%20new%20global%20Ipsos%20study,of%206.1%20across%2029%20markets.">an Ipsos poll</a> , with all the concomitant health and life-extending benefits that brings. People seem to embrace pro-cycling infrastructure when it exists; increasing the number of cycle lanes in Paris led to a <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/increase-paris-cycle-lanes-leads-dramatic-rise-bike-commuting/">54% increase in cycle usage</a>.</p>
<p>And air pollution does more than cause our planet to burn up. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/doctors-urge-politicians-to-stand-firm-on-schemes-to-tackle-air-pollution">group of doctors wrote</a> to the Labour leader and mayor of London begging them not to bow to the pressure to throw away the progress made so far with initiatives such as ULEZ because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Air pollution affects every one of us from before we are born into old age. It not only causes respiratory conditions such as asthma, but also heart attacks, heart arrhythmias, strokes, child developmental disorders, lung cancer and dementia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/air-pollution-linked-rise-antibiotic-resistance-imperils-human-health">recent study</a> also suggests that air pollution may be exacerbating the rise of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance already kills 1.3 million people a year, and if it gets out of hand could in theory make a serious dent in global human population numbers. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.&rdquo; according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance">World Health Organisation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ULEZ scheme specifically seems to be helping on the air pollution front. London&rsquo;s air pollution <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/new-report-reveals-transformational-impact-expanded-ultra-low-emission-zone-so-far">has dropped</a>. I haven&rsquo;t looked into how to quantify this directly in terms of health benefits. But 4,000 of London&rsquo;s deaths were apparently <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/213273/tackling-londons-pollution-will-increase-life/">attributable to air pollution</a> in 2019 so there are some major wins potentially to be had.</p>
<p><a href="http://erg.ic.ac.uk/research/home/resources/ERG_ImperialCollegeLondon_HIA_AQ_LDN_11012021.pdf">One study suggested</a> that if the mayor&rsquo;s air pollution policies were followed then Londoners would gain an extra 6.1 million life years by 2050. It would be even higher, 20% higher, if they managed to meet the World Health Organisation guidelines.</p>
<p>The ULEZ scheme itself aims to <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/environment-and-climate-change/pollution-and-air-quality/ultra-low-emission-zone-ulez-london">save over a million hospital admissions</a>, albeit this particular figure sounds like a somewhat vague aspiration that won&rsquo;t be realised until 2050 so possibly one should dig into the evidence around that before parroting it too much.</p>
<p>The doctors raised another important point, and one that highlights that any &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; or economic harm caused to some people by ULEZ is down to policy choices, not its overall objective.</p>
<p>The policy shouldn&rsquo;t stand alone. Rather there should be &ldquo;a commitment to a much more affordable, frequent and reliable public transport system&rdquo; as well. People do need to get to places. No sensible person should argue otherwise. But I can easily think of several other carrot-rather-than-stick approaches that might be added to the mix, rather than removing one of the few things that seems to be working for the sake of the Conservatives desperate attempt to introduce some US-imported-style culture war banter as a last ditch effort to not get totally laughed out of office next time we have a general election.</p>
<p>Obviously the idea should be to put together a package of policies that improve the health of us and our planet whilst mitigating any downsides of any individual approach. Not just give up and throw them all in the landfill-destined bin because a few of those people not rendered too ill by air pollution to get to the polling station in a couple of years time might vote for you.</p>
<p>The insanity is not limited to the motorist love-ins unfortunately. Last week Sunak announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hundreds-of-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-to-boost-british-energy-independence-and-grow-the-economy-31-july-2023">a vast expansion</a> of North Sea oil and gas drilling. Living as we do in a post-truth world, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">he claims</a> that this is &ldquo;entirely consistent with our plan to get to net zero&rdquo;. He actually seems to think that it&rsquo;s positively pro-environment. More on this in a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">Oxfam&rsquo;s climate advisor disagrees</a> and highlights that should we want to generate more energy more locally at less environmental cost - all good objectives when the current option often seems to lead to paying war criminals big bucks to import it let alone the environmental concerns - there is an obvious alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low-carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s proposing nationalising the process, or really doing anything other than let whichever company does the extraction run riot on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; market as far as I can see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/rishi-sunak-approval-100-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-licences-fossil-fuel-climate-crisis">Per Mike Childs</a> from Friends of the Earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences will simply pour more fuel on the flames, while doing nothing for energy security as these fossil fuels will be sold on international markets and not reserved for UK use</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar comments abound. Kate White from the WWF is <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-heads-to-scotland-for-net-zero-energy-policy-push-12930459">quoted by Sky News</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; [Sunak&rsquo;s plan will] do nothing to cut household energy bills or shore up our energy security - it will simply line the pockets of the extractive industry while the world burns&hellip;the solution to the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis is in affordable, clean energy; better insulation for our homes; and restoring our natural world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carbon Brief <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-why-banning-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-is-not-a-just-stop-oil-plan/">looked into</a> some of the energy security related claims. Unsurprisingly they don&rsquo;t stack up.</p>
<p>Apparently on average it takes 28 years after the granting of oil and gas licenses for the flow of fossil fuels to start. If it&rsquo;s anything like as long as that then these fuels won&rsquo;t come online until the 2040s. They do nothing to solve today&rsquo;s security or cost of living crisis. And by 2040 we should be well on our way towards net zero, with the plan (supposedly supported by Sunak) being to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050. If we need a new flow of fossil fuel at that point then something went very wrong.</p>
<p>There are so many other ways the government could improve the cost of living situation for UK citizens that don&rsquo;t involve waiting a quarter of a century and hoping big businesses show unprecedented compassion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no reason to suspect the fossil fuel companies would by remotely shy about maximising their profits from any new gas and oil that they could possibly get their hands on. In these cost-of-living-whilst-the-world-burns crisis times Shell recently reported its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/04/shell-makes-record-quarterly-profits-of-nearly-10bn">largest ever first quarter profits</a>: $9.6 billion for the first quarter of this year. BP made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/02/bp-profits-energy-windfall-tax-oil-gas">$5 billion profit</a> during the same period.</p>
<p>Sunak et al also seem to have gotten this odd idea that &ldquo;buying local&rdquo; is incredibly environmentally beneficial when it comes to fossil fuels, claiming that importing fuel from elsewhere <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12355601/Rishi-Sunak-Just-Stop-Oil-Labour-North-Sea-oil-gas.html">ends up releasing 3-4x</a> as many carbon emissions.</p>
<p>At first this made me wonder if Sunak thinks that we import oil by putting it into small bottles and hand delivering it via single-passenger private jets or something. Once I got over myself, I actually looked into what the reality is and wrote about it in more detail <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2023/08/10/is-british-gas-and-oil-really-4x-as-good-for-the-environment-as-imported-fuel/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The TLDR would be that the &ldquo;3-4x the emissions&rdquo; claim for imported alternatives to North Sea gas and oil is not exactly an outright fiction but it&rsquo;s very misleading. It appears to refer to only the emissions associated with the <em>transport</em> of fuel, only for gas, and only for the minority of gas that is transported to the UK in liquid form.</p>
<p>The process of shipping gas via boat involves converting it to liquid form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas">Liquified Natural Gas</a>, or &ldquo;LNG&rdquo;) before putting it on a boat and then converting it back when it arrives. That is an energy intensive process, quite possibly <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/">generating 3-4x the emissions</a> associated with (just) the <em>transporting</em> of <em>gas</em> via methods not involving LNG, such as via a pipeline.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that only a minority of Britain&rsquo;s imported gas is transported via LNG. <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/news/2023/north-sea-gas-is-almost-four-times-cleaner-than-lng-imports/">Most of it</a> comes through a pipeline and hence does not incur anything like that process' emissions penalty.</p>
<p>In any case, the emissions generated by even the nasty LNG gas process are <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/sunak-claims-north-sea-gas-four-times-less-polluting-than-imports">only a small fraction</a> of the total emissions generated during the lifecycle of the gas overall. The large majority of emissions come from the actual use of the fuel itself. There is no possible way to reduce the actual emissions associated with that gas by anything like as much as 3-4x by fiddling around with the extraction or transport process when most of the emissions are associated with the end use of the gas itself.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, oil isn&rsquo;t affected by the LNG process so I couldn&rsquo;t find any similar-in-scale emissions savings to be had there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also of note that some countries <a href="https://www.petro-online.com/news/fuel-for-thought/13/sp-global/two-thirds-of-uk-and-norway-north-sea-oil-and-gas-production-has-lower-than-average-greenhouse-gas-intensity-new-analysis-finds/59378#:~:text=The%20analysis%20found%20that%2C%20on,(8%20kgCO2e%2Fboe).">are substantially better than the UK</a> at extracting gas and oil in terms of having reduced emissions for the extraction process itself. The trend there will also be <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Letter-to-Kwasi-Kwarteng-Climate-Compatibility-of-New-Oil-and-Gas-Fields.pdf">that they improve further</a> if they enact the process improvements that they&rsquo;ve already committed to. But this is still not the biggest deal: remember that the majority of the emissions associated with gas come from the usage of the gas itself.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, switching to basically any form of renewable energy would vastly outweigh even the very best case emissions savings one could get from the North Sea network. Vastly. Yes, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html">even when you take into account the end-to-end impact</a> of manufacturing, maintaining and disposing of the equipment needed to use renewables.</p>
<p>Other assumptions that one would have to make in order to see even the small North Sea emissions benefit prospectively on offer include:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the North Sea gas is all kept and used in the UK rather than being exported elsewhere. As mentioned above, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that that will happen.</li>
<li>That any extra gas and oil extracted from the North Sea means that there will be a similar reduction in the amount extracted (and in part exported via LNG) globally. I see no reason to think that that will be true. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ve reached a level where the demand for energy is entirely satiated. Instead, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the oil and gas market will simply enlarge. And if more gas and oil is sold then - especially as most of the associated emissions come from the use of the fuels - proportionally more pollution will be generated.</li>
</ol>
<p>So for all Sunak&rsquo;s hobby of &ldquo;talking about freedom&rdquo; he seems to be chatting about only very specific types of freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a type of freedom that values the freedom to create traffic jams on unsuitably small residential roads over the freedom to not become ill from other people&rsquo;s air pollution infusing your home. The freedom to legally drive 10 miles per hour faster than you used to be able to, over the freedom to not be involved in a fatal accident. The freedom for a few to greatly profit from the harmful exploitation of natural resources over the freedom for us all to live in a planet with a bearable climate.  You can&rsquo;t enjoy exceeding the 20 mph limit all that much if you are too ill or too dead to drive.</p>
<p>The people who tend to be most <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-hurts-poorest-most">vulnerable to pollution</a> or the immediate <a href="https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/climate-change/how-climate-change-impacts-poverty">ravages of climate change</a> are of course on average poorer, more disadvantaged, and hold less economic and political power than the average person, let alone the CEO of whichever big oil company and the owners of very fast cars. In this way, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/frank-wilhoit-nearperfectly.html">Frank Wilhoit&rsquo;s evergreen canard</a> that conservatives naturally tend towards the idea that laws exist to protect in-groups by binding out-groups shows its face once again.</p>

			 <p>🎙️ Listening to <a href="https://techpod.content.town/">Brad &amp; Will Made A Tech Pod</a>.</p>
<p>The name is pretty self-explanatory. Lots of tech talk, but way less Apple-obsessed as many of the computery podcasts I&rsquo;ve encountered over the years. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve just been looking in the wrong place, but it&rsquo;s nice to see Windows, Linux et al getting a look-in for those of us not fully uploaded to the iCloud.</p>
<p>Not that it&rsquo;s all computer-nerding. VR, electric cars and space travel feature in the promo blurb. I learned a lot about how to make decent coffee from a <a href="https://techpod.content.town/episodes/192-straight-out-the-bunn">recent episode</a>. Still need to put it into practice but at least I know how disgusting my current coffee practice is now.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling drawn to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux operating system</a> recently, partly under the guise of <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/article/seizing-the-means-of-computation">seizing the means of computation</a> away from those who would <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/25/the-rule-of.html">surveil us</a>, distract us <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/11/21/microsoft-is-turning-windows-11s-start-menu-into-an-advertisement-delivery-system/">with adverts</a> each time we want to open an app or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-bans-sideloading-ios-apps-mac-m1">restrict us</a> from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/windows-11-hardware-requirements-security/">using our devices</a> as we wish.</p>
<p>Moving as much as possible towards open source software where people who have the coding skills can see exactly what it&rsquo;s doing and contribute changes to anything they don&rsquo;t like seems like A Good Thing overall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been double digit years since I&rsquo;ve looked into Linux. I used it for a while in the past doing networking related stuff but not for more day-to-day tasks. But since then it looks like there&rsquo;s been several options developed that address the challenges that were present back in the day. Namely that it was just all so complicated to set up in comparison to the more &lsquo;consumer-friendly&rsquo; operating systems, doubly so if you wanted to use it in alongside those operating systems.</p>
<p>It was also potentially tricky to find equivalent software to that one may have been used to using on other platforms. However it looks like things have changed a lot in a decade, no surprises there. And, despite only having a limited amount of time to fiddle around with setting things up, it might be well worth trying it out again.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://linuxmint.com/screenshots.php">Linux Mint</a> distribution seems to be recommended by quite few folk for people who don&rsquo;t want to spend a whole lot of time learning a new way of computing or figuring out where to get the necessary software for basic day-to-day computing tasks. It appears to come with a tool enabling easy access to tens of thousands of apps.</p>
<p>So I might try that one. But part of the beauty of this scene is that there&rsquo;s many other options available, as well as the ability to modify any particular option that exists, if the one you try first doesn&rsquo;t appeal in the end.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w">new paper from Scarborough et al.</a> looks again at the level of environmental impact that different types of food pattern consumptions have; everything from vegan through to high meat diets.</p>
<p>How this paper differs from some others I&rsquo;ve seen in the past is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>It standardises the dietary intake of each person, hence ensuring that any observed differences aren&rsquo;t a result of meat eaters simply consuming a different number of calories than vegans.</li>
<li>It takes into account the fact that the environmental impact of a certain type of food can vary dramatically depending on how and where it is produced.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nonetheless, the punchline is basically the same as more straightforward analyses show.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed.</p>
<p>Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity.</p>
<p>At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vegan diets were  superior to high meat diets in every measure of environmental impact here. Whilst there is a lot of uncertainty on some measures due to not knowing how exactly each item of food was sourced, in no case at all is that uncertainty enough to make it remotely plausible that vegan diets actually aren&rsquo;t superior on these measures.</p>
<p>Another repeated finding is that there&rsquo;s good returns from simply cutting down one&rsquo;s amount of meat consumption, or switching to fish. In today&rsquo;s world it seems unlikely that everyone is going to seriously consider becoming vegan, but perhaps all of us that haven&rsquo;t yet done so might consider reducing our meat consumption. It will help the planet.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Below are notes I took from reading the paper: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37271576">How much food tracking during a digital weight management program is enough to produce clinically significant weight loss?</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that weight loss can be facilitated by lifestyle interventions.</p>
<p>One of the strongest predictors of how much weight loss will occur is how often participants track the food and drink they consume each day, usually with a view to remaining within a set calorie goal.</p>
<p>However, tracking your consumption in detail is effortful. Most people do not find it possible to do so over the longer term. One approach to improving adherence would be to reduce the amount of effort required, for example by reducing how often people are asked to track food or reducing the amount of their food they are asked to track.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how much food tracking is needed to get to certain weight loss milestones. Studies so far suggest that &ldquo;abbreviated&rdquo; food tracking approaches do correlate with weight loss, with the possible exception of tracking by taking a photo of the food.</p>
<p>Using data from subscribers to a weight loss program over a 6 month intervention period, the study aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>establish whether the abbreviated method of food tracking facilitated by by the program remains associated with weight loss.</li>
<li>establish thresholds of food tracking that are associated with certain weight loss milestones</li>
</ol>
<p>Aim 1 was tested with both a nonparametric and linear regression methods.</p>
<p>There was a significant correlation between the percentage of days participants tracked food with the percentage of their original weight that the participant lost after 6 months, r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.001.  A 1% increase in the number of days tracking food associated with a 0.08% greater in weight loss.</p>
<p>A ROC curve analysis looked at showed that food tracking was highly predictive of the clinically significant 3%, 5% and 10% weight loss thresholds after 6 months. The optimum predictivity threshold was defined by the sum of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<ul>
<li>For predicting achieving at least a 3% weight loss, the optimum threshold of food tracking corresponded to 29% of intervention days.</li>
<li>For 5% weight loss this was 39% of days tracked,.</li>
<li>67% of days was the optimum threshold for predicting the 10% weight loss threshold.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aim 2 added a time series clustering analysis method, dynamic time warping, to look for similarities between member food tracking behaviour.</p>
<p>This produced 3 clusters based on the number of days participants had tracked food in each week over the intervention period. The clusters differed by levels of food tracking, weight loss, participant age and marital status.</p>
<p>This study could not quantify the mechanisms why participants showed different food tracking behaviours. For instance, perhaps some had higher motivation or fewer barriers to food tracking and/or weight loss.</p>
<p>Limitations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participants were biased towards being female, with college degrees and higher incomes.</li>
<li>This approach cannot fully establish that food tracking causes weight loss. There could be confounders.</li>
<li>Whilst the optimum thresholds for predicting 3%, 5% or 10% of weight loss were established, there was no step-change in cutoff that perfectly predicted weight loss success. We should be cautious about interpreting the specific thresholds here.</li>
<li>Food tracking was defined as tracking at least 1 food item on a given day; other definitions could be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that participants can achieve clinically significant weight loss after 6 months even without perfect adherence to the recommended daily food tracking. In fact, no-one in this study tracked every day. Given that perfect adherence doesn&rsquo;t seem to be possible for most people, and isn&rsquo;t necessary for achieving significant weight loss, we should question whether it should be the default prescription for weight loss interventions.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1663973555">Endless Summer Vacation</a> by Miley Cyrus.</p>

<p>Came to it via the ultra-viral hit Flowers which holds the record for being the fastest ever song to <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/miley-cyrus-flowers-becomes-the-fastest-song-to-reach-a-billion-spotify-streams-3440122">reach a billion streams</a> on Spotify amongst other such achievements, taking 113 days if I did my maths right.

<p>That song book-ends the album: the version you know at the start, a substantially differently-vibed demo version at the end. But there&rsquo;s plenty of pop-rock in-between from the current phase of Miley&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/miley-cyrus-endless-summer-vacation-flowers-new-album-songs-albums-discography-hannah-montana-evolution">constant re-invention</a>.

			 <p>Somehow only today did I realise that you can use if statements directly within <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr library</a> <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter</a> function in order to make conditional filter criteria.</p>
<p>For example if you want to filter a fictional dataframe to show only scores below 10, but only if the variable x has the value &ldquo;filter&rdquo; you can do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r"><span style="color:#a6e22e">filter</span>(data, <span style="color:#a6e22e">if </span>(x <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;filter&#34;</span>) {

    } else {
      my_score <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> my_score
    })
</code></pre></div><p>A variable always equals itself, so the <code>score == score</code> bit effectively means &ldquo;don&rsquo;t apply a filter in this case&rdquo;. You can of course use other criteria there if you want to apply different filters based on different conditions.</p>

			 <p>Inevitably some bright spark has developed a large language model AI chatbot whose explicit purpose is to assist with computer crime.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-J">GPT-J</a>,  WormGPT has no safety rails and has been trained on data from the darker side of the internet. So far its stated uses appear to be to write very convincing phishing scam emails, and to create and advise how to distribute malware.</p>
<p>Not the first area of life I&rsquo;d have picked for needing to democratise and make accessible to all, but there we go. I remember listening to <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2022/automated-email-generation-for-targeted-attacks">an episode of the Data Skeptic podcast</a> last year where a researcher talked about the AI phishing email side of things so it&rsquo;s not exactly a massive surprise that some 2023 malevolent entity went ahead and made it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This project aims to provide an alternative to ChatGPT, one that lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff and easily sell it online in the future. Everything blackhat related that you can think of can be done with WormGPT, allowing anyone access to malicious activity without ever leaving the comfort of their home.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781620405710">The Monopolists</a> by Mary Pilon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As far as board game creation stories go, the story of Monopoly&rsquo;s invention is a well known one. Not least because for a while it was included in the contents of the game box itself, at least in the US.</p>
<p>For the un-initiated: Stuck at home having lost his job during the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">Great Depression</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darrow">Charles Darrow</a> had a sudden flash of inspiration and invented Monopoly. Firstly to amuse his family during that difficult time in American history and latterly, in 1935, to sell to the Parker Brothers company. Darrow ends up as an incarnation of the rags-to-riches American Dream story as hundreds of millions of copies of the game were produced and shipped around the world.</p>
<p>The game certainly spread. In the end millions of groups of gamers would go on to learn the basics of capitalist economics, the dog-eat-dog winner-takes all majesty of the free marketplace, with the winner of each game ending up with reams of imaginary real estate and their respective virtual incoming rents from their non-propertied companions. A true simulation of the American Dream, accessible to all, realised like never before.</p>
<p>Except, inevitably, that story isn&rsquo;t true. Monopoly wasn&rsquo;t really invented by Charles Darrow. Or any other individual entirely. Like many other of humanity&rsquo;s cultural artifacts, what we now know as Monopoly is a pastime that evolved over space and time.</p>
<p>The author starts the story with the person that <em>could</em> perhaps most fairly be termed Monopoly&rsquo;s originator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Magie">Elizabeth Magie</a>. Born in 1866, she was very interested in both politics and inventing. This of course was certainly not encouraged for women of that era. Nonetheless, in 1904 she patented &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord's_Game">The Landlord&rsquo;s Game</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ironically, considering what it turned into, the game was intended to espouse her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Georgist principles</a> and demonstrate the perils of unbridled rentier capitalism; specifically how monopolies over land led to ruin, and how taxes could be used to ameliorate these outcomes. It was intended as part of a political argument against the massive concentration of land-based wealth in the hands of landlords, not a celebration of it.</p>
<p>In general, the Georgist movement was dead against the private accumulation of wealth from land ownership</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">Wikipedia&rsquo;s entry</a> on Georgism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;although people should own the value they produce themselves, the economic rent derived from land—including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Landlord&rsquo;s Game could be played either with Monopolist rules, where players are incentivised to become monopolists and force other players out of the game - these will be familiar to anyone who has played modern-day Monopoly. But it also came with anti-monopolist rules, where the game is won only when every player has doubled their original money by virtue of communal wealth creation.</p>
<p>Educational as it might have been, it didn&rsquo;t sell very well at the time. But it was taken up by certain communities - notably the Quakers and various socialist-leaning academic types - who passed various incarnations of the rules and materials of the game on to their nearest and dearest, sometimes adding or changing a few of the details. Over time it grew ever closer to the Monopoly we know today. Magie&rsquo;s original version already had the property, railroads, utilities and jail squares familiar to us today, as well as idea of continuously circling a square board with no pre-defined end, a relatively rare setup at that point time. As it passed from hand-to-hand some of the properties got renamed and the Chance and Community Chest cards we&rsquo;re familiar with today were developed.</p>
<p>What came next is a frustrating lesson in intellectual property law. After Darrow sold &ldquo;his&rdquo; game idea to Parker Brother, they went on to persuade Magie to sell them the patent to her original Landlord&rsquo;s Game, misleading her into thinking that they would mass produce and market copies of it, with its original message intact, worldwide.</p>
<p>Well, have you ever seen &ldquo;The Landlord&rsquo;s Game&rdquo; in a game shop? Of course not. In reality, they&rsquo;d wanted to acquire the patent to protect themselves from the increasingly obvious truth that the real story behind the Monopoly game they were selling in such a profitable manner was not one that suited them.</p>
<p>If this book is to be believed - and it certainly seems very thoroughly researched - Darrow and  Parker Brothers behaved somewhat deviously, probably fraudulently, to do their best to retain the sole right - the monopoly -  to sell Monopoly based on its manufactured origin story. Whilst of course compensating none of the many other people who contributed towards the development of the modern-day institution of Monopoly over the decades.</p>
<p>Again layering on the irony, some of the truth of this came out as part of another intellectual property related court case, but one that Parker Brothers initiated. An economist called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Anspach">Ralph Anspach</a> created a game called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Monopoly">Anti-Monopoly</a>&rdquo; in 1973 that was designed to help people understand the perils of real-life monopolies.</p>
<p>Parker Brothers didn&rsquo;t like that the name involved the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; and took him to court to prevent him selling his game. Preparing his defence led Anspach down a path of somewhat obsessive research into the history of Monopoly, with the resulting idea that Monopoly itself should be in the public domain with the copyrights and trademarks Parker Brother claimed to hold being invalid. A decade later a settlement was reached, but not before the case materials revealed a lot of the truth that Mary Pilon now, in turn, reveals to us.</p>

			 <p>Another upsetting outcome of the inevitable coming together of the generative AI infocalypse, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">enshittified</a> subscription service monopolies, misguided algorithmic recommendation systems and the incentives of modern-day capitalism has been achieved. This time this victim is books.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7b774/ai-generated-books-of-nonsense-are-all-over-amazons-bestseller-lists">According to Vice</a>, many of the supposedly most popular entries in the Amazon Kindle Unlimited subscription service&rsquo;s bestseller list recently were in fact fully AI generated nonsense.</p>
<p>A rash of books with similar covers, quite random titles and absolute nonsense inside them apparently hit the top 100 list, at least in categories such as Young Adult romance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My favourite of the ones Vice reported on has to be the catchily named &ldquo;Apricot Bar Code Architecture&rdquo;. The introductory sentence, if you please:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Black lace pajamas, very short skirt, the most important thing, now this lace pajamas are all wet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t imagine too many readers made it all the way through these books meaning that whoever put them there probably isn&rsquo;t raking in too much money per reader. It seems like Kindle Unlimited is paying something like 0.4 US cents per page read, if I understand <a href="https://chrismcmullen.com/2020/06/22/what-is-the-kindle-unlimited-per-page-rate-a-current-month-by-month-breakdown/">Chris McMullen&rsquo;s post</a> correctly. But the fact that they got to the top of the rankings means they&rsquo;re making some amount of money for someone, likely at the expense of the more traditional actually-makes-sense books.</p>
<p>Because Kindle Unlimited pays authors <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201541130">per page read, not per book read</a>, if you can get 1000 people - real or imaginary - to read the first 5 pages of your effortlessly created clickbait book then you&rsquo;ll get <a href="https://justpublishingadvice.com/is-kindle-unlimited-pay-per-page-read-fair-for-authors/">the same amount of financial reward</a> as someone who can get 10 people to read the entirety of their award-winning 500 page novel - and more than if 5 people who read your 500 page novel valued it so much that throughout their later life they each read it another 10 times each.</p>
<p>I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t take much for the same folk who set up fake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm">ad-clicking farms</a> to switch to fake book-reading farms.</p>

			 <p>New(ish) Conservative party faction just dropped. Let&rsquo;s welcome the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Conservatives_(UK)">New Conservatives</a>&rdquo; to the party.</p>
<p>They join the <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/who-are-the-british-national-conservatives/">National Conservatives</a> and a bunch of other factions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Group">European Research Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID_Recovery_Group">Covid Recovery Group</a>, <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955771/who-are-tory-net-zero-scrutiny-group">Net Zero Scrutiny Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_Group">Common Sense Group</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Collar_Conservatism">Blue Collar Conservatism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Research_Group">Northern Research Group</a> and no doubt many others that don&rsquo;t quite come to the top of my mind right now. One day there will be more factions than politicians if we lucky.</p>
<p>The New Conservatives faction has the extremely non-unique selling point of not liking immigrants. They did manage to come up with a 10 point policy, but every point is a unsubtle rewording of &ldquo;immigration needs stopped&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although if they do ever fully exhaust our patience with anti-immigration cruelty they <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-rishi-sunak-tory-new-conservatives-mp-cut-immigration/">do have aspirations</a> to move onto being - can you guess? Let&rsquo;s all say it together: anti-woke.</p>
<p>🥱</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let the i headline speak for itself:  <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/theyre-dickheads-new-conservatives-group-of-mps-will-cost-us-the-election-sunak-allies-say-2456774">‘They’re dickheads’: New Conservatives group of MPs will cost us the election, Sunak allies say</a></p>
<p>In particular they appear to be very concerned that the current Prime Minister - who constantly explicitly tells us that lowering immigration, at a time where in some ways the country might actually need immigrants more than ever even for purely selfish reasons, is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-five-key-priorities-for-2023">one of his top priorities</a> at basically any cost - even the cost of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-court-rule-if-plan-relocate-asylum-seekers-rwanda-is-lawful-2023-06-28/">breaking international law</a> -  should think about adding lowering immigration as one of his priorities. How efficient they are to have achieved their goals before they even existed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fun interview on the July 3rd episode of <a href="https://www.globalplayer.com/podcasts/episodes/7Drgf42/">The News Agents podcast</a> where the one of the high-ups of this pointless new faction really really tries to wriggle out of agreeing that what he wants to is prevent is even the most cruelly oppressed and tortured women stuck in Afghanistan from seeking asylum in the UK amongst other things, when that actually seems to be the whole point of his tediously unoriginal faction. Add dishonesty to the litany of sins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nigel Farage has criticised the Home Office’s decision to paint over murals of cartoon figures at an asylum centre for lone children, describing it as “a bit mean”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good grief. If <em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-kent-beach-invasion-video-anti-migrant-immigration-a9658246.html">Nigel Farage</a></em> thinks <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/07/14/the-latest-deranged.html">your immigration policy</a> is cruel that really should give you cause to question its morality.</p>
<p>But Sunak et al are still sticking to their story that wanting to see Mickey Mouse is a the main  driver of the treacherous journey some of the most desperate children in the world make to our shores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister’s spokesman suggested the decision was designed to “deter” asylum seekers from crossing the Channel as part of the Mr Sunak’s promise to “stop the boats”.</p>

			 <p>The latest deranged volley in the Conservative Government&rsquo;s extremely inhumane and extremely ineffective &ldquo;anti-immigration&rdquo; policy has arrived.</p>
<p>It turns out that some asylum reception centres have cartoon images on display.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(image from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/07/robert-jenrick-has-cartoon-murals-painted-over-at-childrens-asylum-centre">The Guardian</a>)</p>
<p>This is, of course, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/04/18/woke-dover-welcome-signs-channel-migrants-to-be-replaced/">Too Woke</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/minister-home-office-staff-paint-over-art-asylum-centre-2451897">The Independent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Immigration Minister said pictures of cartoons and animals must be removed and that staff should make sure they are painted over, as they give an impression of welcoming, which Mr Jenrick didn’t want to show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The staff, being humans, <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/home-office-staff-refusing-ministers-order-to-paint-over-art-for-children-at-asylum-centre-2457066">didn&rsquo;t want to do this</a>. But it seems like in the end Robert Jenrick <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12274463/Home-Office-paints-Mickey-Mouse-murals-asylum-centre-unaccompanied-children-Kent.html">got his way</a>.</p>
<p>Presumably the concern is that millions of children are going to willingly risk their lives at great personal cost to themselves and any remaining family that they may or may not have in order to enter a country that is actively hostile to their very existence mainly because they want to see a picture of Mickey Mouse.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Frank Wilhoit <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">succinctly encapsulates</a> how at least a subset of conservatives - I suppose he would say all conservatives - appear to think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:</p>
<p>There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may feel contrary to the classic, now feeling extremely old-fashioned, idea that conservative politics tends towards the politics of law and order.</p>
<p>That sentiment was never straightforward to interpret. There is more to law and order than proudly caging the largest number of people you could possibly justify in an entirely inadequate prison system. But in Wilhoit&rsquo;s telling it presumably can&rsquo;t really ever be the case. At least not whilst the law purports to be something that applies equally to all people.</p>
<p>At any moment in time the conservative parties and surrounding movement might look to be extremely pro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)">law and order</a>. But this just means that the law is such that it currently promotes their own interests, usually at the expense of some other group&rsquo;s interest.  Should this stop being the case, so will the avid conservative fandom around the legal process.</p>
<p>These examples are probably so obvious as to not really be worth expressing, but we can see how quickly certain branches of the UK and US conservative movements reacted with wanton disrespect for the legal process and norms as soon as their political heroes - Boris Johnson and Donald Trump - were called to account for their illegal and immoral behaviour.</p>
<p>Johnson was more than happy to explicitly <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-brexit-international-law-eu-withdrawal-agreement-b431691.html">break international law</a> to get his own personally-preferred type of Brexit. In the mean time, some of the conservative British media attempted to brand judges who were insufficiently enthusiastic about that same event as being &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling">enemies of the people</a>&rdquo;. Trump&rsquo;s supporters, well, some of them famously engaged in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">a violent insurrection</a>.</p>
<p>In Wilhoit&rsquo;s mind then, what would anti-conservatism thinking look like? Simply put, the idea that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a sidenote, <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/">we&rsquo;re not talking about</a> Francis Wilhoit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_M._Wilhoit">the political scientist</a>, but rather Frank Wilhoit the classical music composer who just happens to share the same name.</p>

<p><code>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</code> automatically creates a new branch whose name is the final component of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>, which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic.

<p>I&rsquo;m totally guessing, but I&rsquo;m going to assume that the sudden failure of this method of embedding tweets was a side effect of  Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; change to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/twitter-makes-tweets-super-secret-and-inconvenient-if-you-log-out/">prevent not-logged in users</a> from seeing anything on Twitter.

			 <p>For anyone who is sick of either whatever the latest &ldquo;rich person ruins social network&rdquo; drama is or the thought of what their own younger self thought was just fine to post to the entire world, the software &ldquo;<a href="https://redact.dev/">Redact</a>&rdquo; looks like a free and versatile way to remove your posts from a huge variety of services.</p>
<p>It contains filters to allow you to selectively delete things. For example, perhaps you want to delete only Reddit posts you made last year that included the phrase &ldquo;I love Reddit&rdquo;, or only the last 7 days of your Twitter DMs. You can also <a href="https://redact.dev/support/ui/desktop/scheduler">set up a schedule</a> if you want to repeat the delete every so often.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking at some of the commentary around the tool it seems like it occasionally stops working for some services. Presumably this is due to changes the social network companies make, including those targeted at stopping tools like this. I suppose you might be infringing certain terms of services if you mass-delete like this in many cases. But whilst the networks don&rsquo;t spend much effort building their own tools to make it easy to manage and delete your past submissions to their services for obvious reasons this certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel like a <em>moral</em> crime.</p>
<p>In order to delete things you are going to have to log into your account of the respective services through this software, so you will have to feel OK about trusting that the software isn&rsquo;t doing bad things. <a href="https://redact.dev/faq">They claim</a> that Redact doesn&rsquo;t store your info or transmit it anywhere, that their staff have no way of seeing your username of password. But it is closed-source so you can&rsquo;t check the code directly, so caveat emptor I suppose. I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone suggesting that anything malicious is going on.</p>
<p>The full list of services it can remove stuff from is long:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discord</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitch</li>

			 <p>In &ldquo;<a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/i-wanted-to-be-a-teacher-but-they">I wanted to be a teacher but they made me a cop</a>&rdquo; Adam Mastroianni makes the case that teaching someone is not the same as evaluating someone. The two are often in fact at odds with each other.</p>
<p>He suggests separating the two. Some people become professional teachers, others become professional evaluators. They are after all very different jobs even if we usually try to wedge the latter into the former right now, despite the (over)importance of grades et al. in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doing evaluation on its own would have a few major benefits. First, it would force us to take evaluation seriously.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Second, we’d see how hard evaluation is, and maybe we’d do it better.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>And finally, if we made evaluation its own thing, we’d see how nasty it is, and maybe we’d do less of it.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781444741223">11.22.63</a> by Stephen King.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Jake Epping, a down-on-his-luck teacher, is recruited by a friend to kill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> before he gets a chance to kill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">President J. F. Kennedy.</a></p>
<p>Why? His friend, Al, believes that if JFK had survived then the world would now be a much better place, not least because his practice of politics may have meant that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> would never have happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get rid of one wretched waif, buddy, and you could save millions of lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how, given the book is set in relatively modern times, 2011? Well, as luck would have it, Al has discovered a strange portal in a corner of a diner. Walking through it leaves you in the same geographic location in the year 1958.</p>
<p>You can return back to modernity as and when you want. And no matter how long you spent in the past-times world, it&rsquo;s only 2 minutes later when you come back to 2011. But it might be a totally different 2011 if you did something in the past that had substantial repercussions.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy">Kennedy was shot in 1963</a>. So Jake has a few years to get accustomed to discretely living in the past, to learn how the world used to work. Unfortunately for him, the past has a way of resisting changes to the original timeline. You might plan to do something that was never done in the 1960s only to be inexplicably diverted, distracted or incapacitated en-route. This tendency is not infallible, the past can change in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not entirely straightforward.</p>
<p>A further complication is of course the mystery surrounding the JFK assassination. In our world there are plenty of people out there who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories">do not believe</a> Oswald was the real assassin, or at least not the sole person involved. These people include the large majority of Americans in a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1813/most-americans-believe-oswald-conspired-others-kill-jfk.aspx">2001 poll</a>.</p>
<p>Would killing Oswald in cold blood <em>really</em> stop JFK being assassinated? Especially if not only is there a decent chance that he wasn&rsquo;t the sole operator involved, but also that tendency of the the past to exert mysterious forces in the direction of recreating its original timeline.</p>
<p>Jake is not a natural murderer. Understandably he wants some certainty that there is some point to conducting this operation before committing such an alien act.</p>
<p>Of course that&rsquo;s not the only unknown. Sure, Al believes JFK staying alive long would have dramatically improved the world. But would it really? Would there be no cost to pay at all? Few people would feel certain about that, and Jake is no stranger to doubt. So many time travel stories have conveyed to us the idea that altering the past could have intended consequences for the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, living in any community for several years means you&rsquo;ll struggle not to build up a lifestyle, habits and human relationships that might be hard to put aside for a small chance of possibly doing something that may or may not make the future a bit better. That&rsquo;s even if you could navigate your way through an alien world that resists your every attempt to change it so as to be in the right place at the right time to put a potentially huge dent into standard-timeline history.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m pleased to say that a mere 800ish pages later you&rsquo;ll find out what Jake thought and did.  Yes, it is a mammoth tome, so long that had it not come with such a strong recommendation I doubt I&rsquo;d have considered starting it. But the recommendation was a good one. It was over long before I could ever have gotten bored of it.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781804547779">Red Team Blues</a> by Cory Doctorow.</p>
<p>In this novel, Martin Hench is an almost-retired forensic accountant who has expert skills in tracking down criminals committing financial-style crimes. We&rsquo;re talking about the mega-rich and their penchant for moving money around in order to conceal  their unnecessary wealth or fund things that should not be funded; money laundering, tax evasion, all that unfortunate stuff.</p>
<p>But before calling it a day he agrees to do one last job for a friend who made a rather questionable decision when designing a new cryptocurrency with very problematic implications. Whilst the rewards on offer are substantial, this final job of course turns out to be a bit more complicated than Hench expected.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The title of the book comes from the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red team</a> vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)">blue team</a> used in several fields including cybersecurity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A red team is a group that pretends to be an enemy, attempts a physical or digital intrusion against an organization at the direction of that organization, then reports back so that the organization can improve their defenses.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>There may also be a blue team, a term for cybersecurity employees who are responsible for defending an organization&rsquo;s networks and computers against attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the red team are the attackers. That&rsquo;s the position Hench usually found himself in during his career, albeit  he wasn&rsquo;t just pretending to be the enemy.</p>
<p>The blue team are the defenders, in his life this would be the role of the criminals he tracks down as they seek to hide their identities and wealth.</p>
<p>Throughout the book we learn the power imbalance in these roles: the blue team must constantly defend against every possible threat, whereas the red team just needs to be successful one time to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it hard not to love a book with this amount of computer nerdery in it. I mean, you don&rsquo;t read sentences  like &ldquo;Danny was old Silicon Valley, a guy who started his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a> host so he could help distribute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt.*_hierarchy">alt hierarchy</a>&rdquo; in all that  many action thrillers. Some of the technology behind cryptocurrency also features. But don&rsquo;t let that put you off if you have different tastes. It&rsquo;s not an academic treatise. You don&rsquo;t need to have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">the blockchain</a> in order to appreciate the action.</p>
<p>I even enjoyed the acknowledgements: &ldquo;thanks to every crypto grifter for giving me such fertile soil to plow&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/19-thoughts-on-affirmative-action">Yglesias' post </a>in response to the recent SCOTUS <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-affirmative-action-programs-harvard-unc-rcna66770">ruling against affirmative action</a> will generate plenty of heated debate. But I was struck by one of the points that&rsquo;s not really about affirmative action at all, or at least not along the dimensions of identity we mostly commonly think about with this topic.</p>
<p>Part of the benefits of being allowed into an elite US university is that they&rsquo;re tremendously well resourced. Harvard&rsquo;s endowment fund was worth <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/10/15/endowment-returns-soar-2021/">an astonishing $53 billion</a> recently. It could provide a huge amount of the best quality educational resources to it&rsquo;s ~21k students.</p>
<p>But should it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the smarter you are at age 18, the more educational resources you should receive” is not an obviously correct allocation of social resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be an empirical matter as to what educational distribution model is best for a given society. But first we&rsquo;d have to define what &ldquo;best&rdquo; even means.  I&rsquo;m sure there are  many highly conflicting opinions out there on that.</p>
<p>Perhaps today&rsquo;s division of educational resources is the ideal arrangement for some outcome. But it&rsquo;s certainly not some kind of natural law that the lion&rsquo;s share of these resources must go towards the people who already did particularly well on a test when they were a child.</p>
<p>Especially insomuch as the sort of people who <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-022-00120-3">do well on school tests</a> and, even moreso, <a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2017/01/low-income-students-harvard">gain access to elite institutions</a> today tend to be those who <em>already</em> had access to the most resources since the day that they were born.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of weeks ago I went to the <a href="https://feverup.com/m/96397">Van Gogh Immersive Experience</a> in London.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the gentleman in question.</p>
<p><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/uploads/2023/4755ffee9f.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"

  />
</a>

</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m in general artistically ignorant, I was already a fan particularly of his extremely famous &ldquo;Starry Night&rdquo;. The exhibition was kind of short and a bit gimmicky in places, but I do feel like I came away with a deeper appreciation and knowledge of the fellow and a deeper awareness of his art so I&rsquo;m overall happy enough to have gone.</p>
<p>One such new-to-me fact was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh#">Van Gogh</a> was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/was-vincent-van-gogh-color-blind-it-sure-looks-like-it-27576085/">thought to be colourblind</a>. This may be what is behind his iconic use of colour. Perhaps he literally saw the world differently to most of us do.</p>
<p>Born in 1853, Van Gogh was an even more tortured soul than I had realised. Famously he had psychotic episodes, worsening over his life. These occurred alongside bouts of depression, epilepsy and possibly bipolar disorder. Without the necessary support it could make him hard to live with at times; the well-known cutting his own ear off incident apparently occurred shortly after a huge row with a housemate.</p>
<p><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/uploads/2023/3ab0a912b7.jpg" 
   class="glightbox"
   data-gallery="61d7f16118c07e4696877c80df0fdd7e"

       style="border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%"
       alt="Copies of several of Van Gogh self-portraits" 
        
  />
</a>

</p>
<p>He was fully aware of his condition and the concomitant delusions, checking himself into a psychiatric hospital after the ear event. Even inside such a place he was artistically productive when not entirely incapacitated, producing some of his very widely known pieces of art. Sometimes these were based only on what he could see out of his room&rsquo;s window, other times by the contents of his dreams: &ldquo;I dream of painting and then I paint my dream&rdquo;. Over his lifetime he produced over 2000 artworks.</p>
<p>Eventually he was deemed fit and safe to go return to the outside world. Unfortunately it was too soon. On the last day of his life, July 27th 1890, aged 37, he painted one final picture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_Roots">Tree Roots</a>, and then, a couple of hours later, shot himself in the chest. It wasn&rsquo;t an instantaneous death, but two days later he was no longer with us.</p>
<p>Sadly, Van Gogh wasn&rsquo;t at all well-known or renowned during his life. The excitement around (and incredible valuations of - some have since sold for the equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_paintings">hundreds of millions of dollars</a>) his paintings came much later.</p>
<p>The main titular &ldquo;immersive&rdquo; part of the exhibition occurs at the end of the show where you get to sit in a deck chair in a big dark room surrounded by animations based on his most famous paintings and quotes, with an appropriate soundtrack for as long as you feel like witnessing the loop.</p>

</p>
<p>Pragmatically, it must be said that given the surfeit of excellent and free museums and galleries in London this one is pretty expensive for what it is. That said, I guess the immersive part of it probably isn&rsquo;t available anywhere else so if you want to see that there&rsquo;s little choice.</p>
<p>My pro tip if you have some-but-not-infinite cash to burn would be to buy the standard ticket (£18 per adult), not the VIP one (£27.90), even if you want to have a go at the extra VR experience. You can buy entrance to the VR part when you&rsquo;re there if you want, currently for £5. VIPs can queue-skip, but then again I went on a random Sunday and there was no queue at all. You also don&rsquo;t get a poster to go home with, but there&rsquo;s plenty to be had in the gift shop.</p>

<p>We braved <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/06/15/the-uk-is.html">the heat</a>, fueled only by frozen variations of cocktails, to take advantage of the many free festivals that were on offer that weekend.</p>

<p>This was on the riverside pedestrian area somewhere outside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southbank_Centre">South Bank Centre</a> if I recall correctly, so there was no roof to raise but without question it would have been had there been one.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@donone5868">Youtube channel</a> for anyone interested in experiencing the Don1 vibe.</p>

<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t catch the name of this duo, but they were a couple of hilarious drag queens with maximum lip syncing and audience interaction. They took a small break in the middle so they could have a quick on-stage prosecco brunch, entirely understandable given the sunshine.</p>

</p>
<p>Why my &ldquo;illegal in the US&rdquo; comment above? Well, it relates to the drag performances that formed part of the above adventures.</p>
<p>As part of the Republican effort to invalidate any minority that doesn&rsquo;t look and behave exactly like Donald Trump, some of their politicians and lawmakers are attempting to introduce bans on drag shows.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t hyperbole. I&rsquo;d foolishly assumed that &ldquo;drag ban&rdquo; was a catchy name in general for the ever more horrific legislation around gender and sexuality certain US states are producing rather than something literally relating to drag shows. And although it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a part of the same effort, there are restrictions or bans specifically for drag shows being proposed.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/anti-drag-show-laws-bans-republican-states?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">the Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the proposed bills include defining a drag performer as someone performing while using dress, makeup and mannerisms associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/commentisfree/2023/mar/10/drag-show-bans-tennessee-lgbtq-rights">absolutely ridiculously restriction</a> on the supposedly sacred freedom of expression value the same folk likely claim to hold dear. The thought that some of the folk enriching our lives by providing hilarious and harmless weekend entertainment could be prosecuted for doing so is truly mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Not that this style of performance would necessarily be what the impact would be limited to. As is typical, laws designed to cause anguish to a section of society that the proposers don&rsquo;t credit as having any moral worth to worry about whatsoever tend to spill over to other areas. Famously, the definition above would presumably ban the several of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing_in_literature#Early_modern_literature">storylines involving cross-dressing</a>. This is especially ironic given that back in the day all of their female characters would have been played by men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not convinced that watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire">Mrs Doubtfire</a> - presumably first in line to lose its PG rating - when I was a kid did me permanent harm. Although having not watched it in a while I also don&rsquo;t know if it aged well.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/06/19/us-residents-can.html">US residents can join class actions against Google and Facebook&#39;s abuse of their data</a></h1>

			 <p>Anyone in the US who did a Google search between 2006-2013 might like to <a href="https://www.refererheadersettlement.com/">sign up here</a> before the end of July 2023 in order to join a class action lawsuit against them.</p>
<p>Google has committed to pay out $23 million dollars in total, although given rather a lot of people did use Google over that 7 year period it&rsquo;s thought to be likely to come out at about $7 per claimant. So honestly it&rsquo;s this is just a very minor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/for-companies-like-facebook-5-billion-fine-just-another-expense-2020-12">cost of doing business</a> for Google unfortunately.</p>
<p>Why the payout? Surprise surprise, it&rsquo;s ad-driven big tech misusing your personal data once again.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/14/technology/google-class-action-settlement-claim.html">NYT&rsquo;s report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consolidated class-action lawsuit filed in 2013 accused the company of &ldquo;storing and intentionally, systematically and repeatedly divulging&rdquo; users' search queries and histories to third-party websites and companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is seen as a violation of privacy laws as well as defying what Google itself claimed to be doing to its users. It&rsquo;s a particular issue because people often search for something quite personal to themselves. We&rsquo;ve largely been trained to feel unconstrained in our searching - Google is the first port of call for many who suspect they are suffering from a medical issue for instance - despite the fact that in reality these days you might often assume that anything you type into the internet will one day be divulged to someone you didn&rsquo;t expect to see it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google search queries often contained sensitive and &ldquo;personally identifiable&rdquo; information, including &ldquo;users' real names, street addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account numbers and more, all of which increases the risk of identity theft</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook is also in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/business/facebook-settlement-apply.html">similar trouble</a> for its unconstrained sharing of your personal data to various external groups, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">infamous Cambridge Analytica</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s parent company, Meta, agreed last year to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of sharing user data or making it accessible to third parties, including the data and political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, without users’ permission</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you used Facebook between May 2007 and December 2022 in the US then <a href="https://facebookuserprivacysettlement.com/#submit-claim">sign up here</a> before August 25th 2023 to apply for your share of a $725 million payout.</p>
<p>I think both these actions require you to have been a US resident during the relevant period, although I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve looked into what exactly the technical definition of that is.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062876812">Divergent Mind</a> by Jenara Nerenberg.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This book encourages us to consider a type of diversity less commonly considered in mainstream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">diversity, equity and inclusion</a> efforts: the differences in how people think and feel, with a focus on how they process sensory input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Temperament rights&rdquo; captures the idea that we should respect individual&rsquo;s temperament and neurology in the same way that we should respect other aspects of people such as their gender, sexuality, or ethnic identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the focus is on people with high sensitivity. This is commonly an aspect of diagnoses like autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, synesthesia or those termed  &ldquo;highly sensitive people&rdquo;, as well as present in plenty of people who have no medical diagnosis at all.</p>
<p>Living in a world not attuned for ones' sensory processing can be overwhelming, exhausting and frustrating. Things that seem perfectly normal to other people - loud music, crowds - can be very stressful. &ldquo;Everyday&rdquo; tasks we&rsquo;re all supposed to be able to do such as housework or adhering to deadlines might be difficult. At the same time they might truly excel in other areas of life.</p>
<p>The difficulties are compounded by the pressure those with these conditions feel to fit in, to appear &ldquo;normal&rdquo; throughout life. They do this by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masking_(personality)">masking</a> their experience. They may feel compelled to do this in every aspect of life, including in social and workplace environments, silently facing an extra challenge many of us do not. Women are apparently particularly prone to this, with their behaviour in general being more policed within our patriarchal society, having been socialised to mask more often and more effectively.</p>
<p>Of course this comes at a cost. Sufferers may appear to lash out or exhibit other behaviours determined by many to be &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. They commonly present with comorbidities such as depression anxiety, shame, guilt, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts and distorted self-image. Masking by definition precludes you from living a life in accordance with your true self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that the person concerned themselves doesn&rsquo;t realise what&rsquo;s causing their challenge. They might seek treatment just for the more visible symptoms of their condition rather than what underlies it, or another condition entirely, which is generally ineffective.</p>
<p>One criticism I&rsquo;ve seen of the book is that it heavily focuses on a particular demographic of folk with neurodivergences - most obviously women, and in particular middle class women. There&rsquo;s not a ton of discussion about the effects of poverty, race, sexuality or other intersections of identity. I can see aspects in this in terms of the suggestions of how to live a life more compatible with one&rsquo;s sensitivities that are provided at times. Moving to a quieter neighborhood, redecorating your house, reading the latest research on neurodivergence or getting a new job more suited to your cognitive style are not exactly opportunities easily open to all.</p>
<p>Of course if you fit into this sort of demographic or know people who do, this might be a benefit rather than drawback when it comes to getting insight into yourself or others, And to be fair, many of the suggestions are more widely applicable.</p>
<p>The critical message of the importance of learning to accept yourself as you are and then working to accept others as they are is clearly a message that can benefit us all. If this book helps people that struggle through life for one reason or another understand they&rsquo;re not alone and certainly not broken or deficient then it&rsquo;ll obviously be a force for good.</p>
<p>On the gender front, a man with such a condition might be a little surprised at its female focus given the title doesn&rsquo;t make that so clear. But I guess it acts as a counterbalance against the dominance of maleness in past psychological and medical research, a topic the book goes into some detail about when it reviews the history of psychology as a discipline. Given some of these conditions may present differently in women than men one might need to read another book on top of this one for a full understanding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a inevitable tension here between the idea of celebrating neurodiversity versus the pathologisation of it. Under the former mindset, no-one&rsquo;s thinking or sensory style is right or wrong. There&rsquo;s tremendous amount of variation such that the concept of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; is itself largely flawed. Whether a mental tendency makes your life harder or easier is often really a product of societal and environmental choices rather than something inherent to the condition - consider the &ldquo;social model&rdquo; of disability.   Even what we regard as a disorder certainly has changed and will again change dramatically over time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DSM is more like a catalogue of current social ailments than scientific hardwired “diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand people do often end up as being labelled as having a  disorder. Some who suffer may seek this out. This risks marking them as &ldquo;aberrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;weird&rdquo; or &ldquo;sick&rdquo;. Expectations may be lowered, judgements may be received. But such a label unfortunately is often necessary to gain access to healthcare or support systems.</p>
<p>Although there can be upsides in carefully-used labels. Many people feel far better once they&rsquo;ve found a label that seems to describe how they exist in the world, that what they experience is both &ldquo;real&rdquo; and acknowledged. It helps them understand why some parts of life feel particularly challenging whilst they may be highly proficient in others. It also makes it easier to find a support community of people like oneself.  The book contains many stories of women who couldn&rsquo;t understand why life seemed to be so much harder for them than others for years until finally, later in life they received a diagnosis. They often felt validated, and gained access to a language that allowed them to discuss their needs with others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly hard to argue with some of the overall takeaways. Sentiments like the quote below are universally useful to bear in mind, even if it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d say is especially particular to the issue of neurodivergence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s really nothing right or wrong about people; we’re all just people doing our best&hellip;It’s important that we see differences, that we don’t deny them; but let it stop there and respond to everyone with kindness and help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it might well be that the often invisible, misunderstood and hard-to-classify neurodivergences are an aspect of humanity that we&rsquo;re particularly bad at considering in this context. We should certainly do our best to fix that. Educating ourselves and others such that such variations in experience exist is surely an important first step in building a world that more people feel comfortable existing within.</p>

<p>b) had knowledge of breaches of the Rules and Guidance that occurred in No. 10.</p>
<p>c) misled the House</p>

<p>if Mr Johnson were still a Member he should be suspended from the service of the House for 90 days for repeated contempts and for seeking to undermine the parliamentary process, by:</p>
<p>a) Deliberately misleading the House</p>
<p>b) Deliberately misleading the Committee</p>
<p>c) Breaching confidence</p>

			 <p>The UK is once again <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65895069">experiencing a heatwave</a>, a situation likely to become <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/press-office/news/weather-and-climate/2018/2018-uk-summer-heatwave">ever more common</a> whilst we fail to solve climate change.

<p>It turns out it depends on where in the UK you live. One declares a heatwave when a location experiences daily maximum temperatures of at least a certain threshold for at least 3 consecutive days. But what the threshold is varies based on which county you are in, as the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/temperature/heatwave">Met Office shows</a> in the below map.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson has stepped down as a Tory MP after claiming he was &ldquo;forced out of Parliament&rdquo; over Partygate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65863267">Boris Johnson</a> and his number one supporter <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65860564">Nadine Dorries</a> resigned at the end of last week. Not the usual &ldquo;resigned from being a minister but still have my job as a member of parliament&rdquo; type resignation, Johnson having already been forced to do that some time ago. But rather a full resignation from being a member of Parliament, including an astonishingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/it-is-sad-to-be-leaving-for-now-boris-johnsons-resignation-statement-in-full">self-pitying and paranoid sounding statement</a> by the former.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sort of odd that having too many illegal parties ended up being the reason that Johnson felt compelled to go. But also I won&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<p>Receiving a diagnosis of obesity significantly increased the odds for a large spectrum of psychiatric disorders across all age groups, including depression, psychosis-spectrum, anxiety, eating and personality disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s evidence elsewhere towards the direction of causation between obesity and mental illness potentially running both ways, in this case the diagnosis of obesity usually came first.</p>
<p>There are many theories as to why this connection might exist presented, ranging from biological explanations such as inflammation or gut bacteria, through to more psychosocial factors, including the impact of obesity on one&rsquo;s quality of life.</p>
<p>It also affects different demographics differently, with the risk of being later diagnosed with a mental health condition being higher in younger people and females (even beyond the usual differential in mental health diagnosis rates).</p>
<p>In any case we might add enhanced mental health support as a requirement for supporting people living with obesity.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-integrates-generative-ai-into-ad-campaigns-395835">Search Engine Land</a>:</p>

<p>Advertisers can submit creative content such as images, videos, and text related to a campaign, and the AI will “remix” these materials to generate ads that target specific audiences and meet objectives like sales targets, according to the presentation.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns that the tool could disseminate misinformation, as AI-generated text can confidently assert falsehoods. One individual familiar with the presentation commented that the AI is optimized for converting new customers and does not have an understanding of truth.</p>

<p>Once the recipient opens it they can read the convo and keep on chatting to the robot mastermind in a copy of the same session. It&rsquo;s a snapshot though, if you continue the conversation after generating the link, the recipient doesn&rsquo;t see the new bits.

<p>I guess the real question is for those folk who have chatGPT perform a sizeable amount of their job for them. Will they communicate with their colleagues exclusively via chatGPT links, or does that give the game away too much?</p>

<p>I came to it for an antidote to the recent AI mega-hype, to which it did provide some counter-balancing relief with episodes featuring experts such as Emily M. Bender  of &ldquo;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922">Stochastic Parrot</a>&rdquo; fame . But the weekly show covers subjects far beyond AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/best-tech-podcasts-reply-all-alternatives">Mashable</a> sums it up well as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a healthy counter dose to the nauseating tech utopia idealism that typically surrounds Silicon Valley and its enthusiast press coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a decent dose of philosophy in between discussions of the technology itself. The most recent episode had an interesting history of consumerism throughout the ages, leading up to the current algorithmically-spewed mess that is the results you get when you search for most categories of products via Google or Amazon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumerism is an anti-solidary machine&rdquo; was one of my favourite soundbites from that one, which also hints at the show&rsquo;s somewhat socialist leanings.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/brooklyn-nine-nine/seasons/8">season 8 of Brooklyn 99</a>.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, the final season of the surprisingly funny police comedy dropped right into a period where humanity had once again been forced to confront the horrors of police brutality after witnessing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd">the murder of George Floyd</a> amongst other horrific incidents. Of course a pandemic had also been raging for a couple of years.</p>
<p>So it had a lot to deal with in order to seem anything other than entirely silly and tasteless.  Given the context, the writers did feel the need to <a href="https://tvline.com/2020/06/23/brooklyn-nine-nine-spoilers-season-8-episodes-police-violence-protests/">throw away the scripts</a> they&rsquo;d already written for the first few episodes and start again. But with their new efforts I think they did reasonably well all things considered.</p>
<p>The pandemic references did seem to fade out after the first few episodes. But in between the various slapstick comedy japes there were obvious attempts to acknowledge and address some of the issues around bad policing and the reactions to it, cringe and otherwise. It might not be enough for anyone who just can&rsquo;t see anything about policing as funny or entertaining any more, but it could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p>And so many fairly funny in-jokes. I wouldn&rsquo;t start with this season if you&rsquo;ve never seen it before. But then again what wild kind of person would ever start a show on anything other than series 1?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/06/05/cannabis-is-now.html">Cannabis is now legal for recreational use in 22 US states</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/06/05/cannabis-is-now.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-05 10:01:05 &#43;0100">Jun 5, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of months ago <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1?r=US&amp;IR=T#delaware-6">Delaware became the 22nd US state</a> to legalise recreational use of cannabis. It&rsquo;ll be taxed at 15% with half the revenue going to a Justice Reinvestment Fund, which is there to  &ldquo;improve quality of life for communities most impacted by the prohibition of marijuana and &lsquo;war on drugs&rsquo; era policies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Medical usage is now legal in 38 US states in addition to Washington DC.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a map showing where and where not, courtesy of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In Washington state, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/wa-senate-passes-bill-to-bar-hiring-discrimination-for-cannabis-use/">legislation is going through the system</a> that helps ensure its new status is respected in a practical as well as legal sense. It will be illegal to discriminate amongst job applicants based on their use of cannabis, so no mandatory pre-interview drug test and the like.</p>
<p>This makes sense because 1) cannabis is legal and the average employer has no business caring about what you do in your spare time when it doesn&rsquo;t affect your work performance, and 2) current tests for cannabis look for the presence of it in bodily fluids rather than whether you&rsquo;re &ldquo;intoxicated&rdquo; from it right now. You can test positive days or potentially weeks after you actually ingested the cannabis. So if the concern is around something like turning up to work high then the tests won&rsquo;t help in any case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll remain some exemptions to the anti-discrimination law for certain jobs in industries like airlines or those requiring security clearance. And employers can still test you after you&rsquo;re hired.</p>
<p>These exemptions are controversial in some quarters, with a representative from The Cannabis Alliance drawing the parallel that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the same approach were applied to alcohol, employers would refuse employment to anyone who enjoyed a beer or glass of wine on the weekend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, over here in the UK, there&rsquo;s been no substantive move in legislation for years for the general use-case. At least not in a sensible direction. Cannabis remains a wholly illegal class B drug, in the same category as for instance amphetamines, whereby mere possession could in theory result in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalties-drug-possession-dealing">prison sentence of 5 years and an unlimited fine</a>. It was actually reclassified from a lesser-penalised class C drug to a class B drug in 2009, which has been its status for the vast majority of time since the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents">1971 Misuse of Drugs Act</a> came into force.</p>
<p>There was one positive and humane move in 2018 when cannabis and some of its derivates <a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/latest-news/a22561279/medicinal-cannabis-products-legal-uk-2018/">were legalised for UK medical use</a>. At least in theory, but seemingly it&rsquo;s under such restrictive controls that it&rsquo;s hardly available in practice.</p>
<p>The NHS details <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/medical-cannabis/">the medical conditions it&rsquo;d be considered</a> for as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very few people in England are likely to get a prescription for medical cannabis. Currently, it is only likely to be prescribed for the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>children and adults with rare, severe forms of epilepsy</li>
<li>adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy</li>
<li>people with muscle stiffness and spasms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
</ul>
<p>It would only be considered when other treatments were not suitable or had not helped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even when these conditions are met, patients report that the NHS rarely delivers the goods. From <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-54749353">the BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NHS has repeatedly refused to fund medical cannabis for children with severe epilepsy, families have said.</p>
<p>Three prescriptions are thought to have been written for &ldquo;whole plant cannabis&rdquo; oil since it was legalised two years ago, campaign group End Our Pain say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leaves families of patients for which these medicines truly do seem to help needing to raise vast sums of money and/or access the uncontrolled black market at the risk of their own liberty in order to get hold of what they need to live a reasonable quality of life.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> looks to be a super useful utility for anyone who works a lot with cloud storage providers. It connects to a huge number of cloud services - Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox, Amazon S3 and many many others, as well as more classic file transfer methods such as FTP. And then you can manage all your cloud files without caring what or where they are.</p>
<p>For example you can easily back up your files to a cloud service, copy files between cloud services or even mount a cloud service as a normal disk drive and use it similarly to how you use your local disk. Imagine never having to use various cumbersome web interfaces and/or install each service&rsquo;s drive syncing software again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s free, open source and works on Windows, Linux and Mac so almost everyone with a computer can give it a whirl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily a command line tool based on various Unix commands, but don&rsquo;t let that put you off. There is an experimental browser interface you could try. But really the power of it makes it probably worth figuring out if you regularly have the sort of tasks to do that it might help with.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard">Star Trek: Picard</a> season <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard/seasons/2">2</a> and <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-picard/seasons/3">3</a>.</p>
<p>Dwelling here only on season 3: if you grew up in the era of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a> and enjoyed it (or at least the re-runs), then it&rsquo;s very likely you will like this one too.</p>
<p>In fact if you only saw certain clips of it then you might think you were actually watching the older series, at least if one overlooks the special effects being less rickety and the entire Enterprise crew having aged a few decades. Space apparently doesn&rsquo;t keep you any younger than standard 21st century living. Not even if you&rsquo;re a robot or an all-powerful never-dying galactic alien or whatever, which is a little strange but I suppose hard to work around.</p>
<p>To be fair, they do try and provide in-episode explanations of this and the other curious happenstances in the fantastical world which probably have more to do with the logistics of getting an old and much-loved human cast from 30 years ago together than a screenwriter&rsquo;s vision. It&rsquo;s occasionally a bit contrived, occasionally a bit cheesy, but I appreciate that one does what one must to allow the original crew to save the galaxy one more time.</p>
<p>There are some systematic differences vs TNG, including more swearing and greater character flaws compared to the almost always extremely family-friendly original. Plus the series is designed to follow a single story line rather than the old-school one-story-per-episode method.</p>
<p>But all in all, it&rsquo;s undoubtedly a parting gift, and an excellent one, to fans of 1980s-1990s trekking. Although I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if it&rsquo;ll be quite as intelligible or entertaining if you don&rsquo;t know, for example, why Worf&rsquo;s new meditation habit is intrinsically hilarious even in concept.</p>

			 <p>A lawyer is facing potential sanctions for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">using chatGPT to create inaccurate legal documents</a> in support of a court case.</p>
<p>In response to an airline claiming that they have no liability to Roberto Mata, who sued an airline on the basis that he was injured by a serving cart, his lawyers submitted a 10-page brief summarising several relevant court decisions.</p>
<p>But the opposing side, and for that matter the judge, couldn&rsquo;t find the details of the cited decisions. Because they didn&rsquo;t exist. The cases were fictional. The lawyer had gotten them from <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, probably quite innocently. To be fair, he&rsquo;d even specifically asked the system to confirm that they were real cases, which it confidently did. But this was one more example of these large language models to &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo;, to produce <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a> that sounds legitimate, is formally referenced and so on, but simply isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>Lawyer Steven Schwartz claims to have not known about this aspect of ChatGPT, which seems like something society is really going to have to address big-time once this technology is <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html">fully integrated within standard office software</a>, assuming these issues persist.</p>
<p>Lawyers are not the only courtroom officials leveraging this new technology even now. There&rsquo;s a couple of reports of judges using it to aid their decision making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/03/colombia-judge-chatgpt-ruling">ChatGPT user from Colombia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A judge in Colombia has caused a stir by admitting he used the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT when deciding whether an autistic child’s insurance should cover all of the costs of his medical treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His decision wasn&rsquo;t entirely based on ChatGPT output, and the verdict doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been all that contentious, but the fact that the tool was used to support it has raised some concern.</p>
<p>Judge Padilla thinks the tech can make the legal system more efficient, in which case it&rsquo;s in line with a 2022 law that requires public lawyers to use technologies that facilitate this. The whole &ldquo;use AI to make important things cheaper&rdquo; is one of the moves that particularly worries me. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like efficiency - which let&rsquo;s face it almost certainly means or proxies for cost - should be the top priority for court decisions.</p>
<p>Secondly <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2023/03/29/indian-judge-uses-chatgpt-for-views-on-bail-plea-of-murder-accused/">one from India</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Indian judge used ChatGPT to make a decision on the bail plea of a man accused of murder&hellip;A bench of Justice Anoop Chitkara at the Punjab and Haryana Court in northern Chandigarh city on Monday sought the AI tool&rsquo;s help while hearing the bail application of Jaswinder Singh, accused of rioting, criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy and murder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These of course are just a couple of cases that happen to have made it to the news for one reason or another. No doubt chatbots are being used by many more professionals in many more courtrooms. It&rsquo;s probably inevitably going to become more widespread over time, short of legislation prohibiting it which seems unlikely (and potentially not desirable at least at some future point).</p>
<p>They are after all a potentially useful tool for many professions. And no-one really quibbles with, for example, allowing lawyers to search the web no matter how much misinformation that contains. But people tend to have an appreciation of the limits of a web search; I doubt many lawyers just paste the first result from a Google unchecked into their court submissions.</p>
<p>The new chatbots that deliver what appears to be a single statement of undisputed truth in a confident manner are likely more dangerous to use in these cases without a thorough understanding of how they work and their limitations, which potentially only a low proportion of users may have.</p>
<p>Of course in a perfect world, we&rsquo;d like to imagine that professionals take care to understand the tools they choose to use. But at some point, particularly with extremely complicated systems subject to extremely high amounts of hype that appear to make one&rsquo;s life easier at no cost, it&rsquo;s probably an unrealistic expectation.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/i/1646945378">This Is Why</a> by Paramore.</p>
<p>A pretty different sound to some of their past albums, including the one that I most recall from my more formative years - <a href="https://album.link/i/604804755">Riot!</a> But, hey, it&rsquo;s 2023, and we&rsquo;ve all changed a lot.</p>
<p>For one, the band members are no longer teenagers, but rather in the dreaded mid-30s. And producing work that feels fairly spot on in terms of describing the terror and angst of a certain very common kind of modern-day adult life.</p>
<p>We start off with a track that could have provided the background music to vast number of social media posts discussing the latest stupid thing, at least in spirit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t leave the house</p>
<p>You say the coast is clear</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t catch me out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they turn to the topic of the news, never a safe watch these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every second, our collective heart breaks</p>
<p>All together, every single head shakes</p>
<p>Shut your eyes, but it won&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>Turn on, turn off the news</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, as instantiation of the guilt we feel when once again we&rsquo;re running late, once again we forgot to do whatever we promised, once again we failed to do the Right Thing, once again we concocted an excuse that we know isn&rsquo;t exactly true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intentions only get you so far</p>
<p>What if I&rsquo;m just a selfish prick?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And whatever happened to the supposed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ok-state-wire-migration-immigration-coronavirus-pandemic-business-361a9bf86ea3175194957b7550bb6051">Roaring Twenties, version 2</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a single year, I&rsquo;ve aged one hundred</p>
<p>My social life: a chiropractic appointment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But honestly, rather than me typing out their entire track list it&rsquo;d be more fun to go listen to the album.</p>

			 <p>Meta has received <a href="">the largest fine for a GDPR breach</a> ever seen - £1 billion - for the way it&rsquo;s been handling European users' data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DPC ruled that transferring European users’ Facebook data to the US created “risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms” of citizens in light of the widespread domestic spying uncovered by whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>Considering that the monopoly that is Facebook is prone to covertly assembling a dossier of your online behaviour <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/29/facebook-privacy-monopoly/">even whilst you&rsquo;re not using it</a> - even if you never signed up to it - what they do with your data is a fairly critical issue.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/chernobyl">Chernobyl</a>.</p>
<p>The catastrophic disaster that followed after the Chernobyl nuclear power station <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">melted down and exploded</a> in 1986 is something that I feel like I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;always&rdquo; known of but with with very little grasp of the what and why behind the event. Even more than 3 decades later it seems to remain within the public consciousness to some extent, occasionally deterring people from embracing the idea of nuclear power plants, frustrating those who feel like nuclear is an essential part of the climate change solution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these days the site appears to have become a common enough stop for  &ldquo;<a href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a27882635/chernobyl-influencers-tourism/">disaster tourists</a>&rdquo;, with social media influencers  <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/chernobyl-hbo-tourism-instagram-influencers">chasing the clicks</a>. There&rsquo;s a Chernobyl tourist information centre <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/28/chernobyl-art-party-nuclear-pripyat-ukraine-artefact-valery-korshunov">that sells</a>  &ldquo;T-shirts, hot-dogs, fridge magnets, gas masks and, if you so choose, a full nuclear fallout suit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In any case, this TV show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/awards/">won many awards</a>, and basically universal acclaim from everyone I personally know who watched it. I don&rsquo;t think it was initially available to watch the UK but if you have a <a href="https://www.nowtv.com/">Now TV</a> subscription it&rsquo;s been there a while. And I certainly found it worth watching, now feeling like I have a much better grasp on the circumstances that surrounded the catastrophe and the context within which it occurred. This is no bland documentary though, the drama is as gripping and compulsive as in any other show I&rsquo;ve seen in recent times. There are some upsetting scenes, as you might imagine.</p>
<p>Of course a risk in these dramatization of real events is that they do not in fact reflect the real event in question all that much. Witness the allegations against <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/05/watched-season-of.html">The Crown</a> for instance. But this one I understand was at least largely <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chernobyl-disaster-how-accurate-is-the-hbo-series/">driven by fact</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of liberties and editorial decisions were of course taken; representing a whole segment of people with an individual, making court case testimony a lot more dramatic and dynamic than it actually was, that kind of thing. The nature of the event is also such that the full and unvarnished truth may in any case never be fully known by anyone outside of those who were involved.</p>
<p>But something I really appreciated and I wish every such &ldquo;dramatisation of a real event&rdquo; show would do was the release of an official <a href="https://pca.st/70TV">accompanying podcast</a> that explained where  each episode diverged from reality and why those decisions were made.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_01_15/">Cat Pictures Please</a> and <a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_05_23/">Better Living Through Algorithms</a> by Naomi Kritzer.</p>
<p>These are a couple of surprisingly wholesome sci-fi short stories. The former has won plenty of awards, including a Hugo award for best short story in 2016.</p>
<p>In the former, the AI behind a search engine becomes sentient - but doesn&rsquo;t feel compelled to destroy humanity.</p>
<p>In the latter, a new social media app launches - but doesn&rsquo;t turn into a destructive hellsite on day one.</p>
<p>So some might say they&rsquo;re perhaps a little far-fetched. But it&rsquo;s a refreshing change from the relentless dystopia associated with near-future technology either in fiction or reality. And who knows, maybe it&rsquo;ll help inspire a bit of IRL thinking about how technology could in fact work for the betterment of our lives.</p>
<p>Reading them also reminded me that short-story magazines exist. Both have been published in  &ldquo;<a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/">Clarkesworld</a>&rdquo;, a monthly sci fi and fantasy magazine I&rsquo;m now tempted to subscribe to.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/21/from-the-guardian.html">The rise of private GP practices in the UK</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Following years of Conservative government mismanagement and un-resourcing of the rightly-venerated <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">National Health Service</a>, the UK is seeing a dramatic rise in the number and usage rates of private GP practices.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/19/patients-paying-550-an-hour-to-see-private-gps-amid-nhs-frustrations">The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patients are paying up to £550 an hour to see private GPs amid frustration at the delays many face getting an appointment with an NHS family doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst the NHS has always had unfortunate exceptions, flaws and inequities in provision it now feels more fragmented than ever before to me. Probably the most critical issue it that it appears to have become essentially unbearable to work in much of the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Resignation rates skyrocket as the workplace conditions become increasingly horrendous, incompatible with living a reasonable life.  From those who remain, we lose <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-crisis-why-are-so-many-staff-leaving-the-health-service-12812473">hundreds of thousands of working days per month</a> to mental health related NHS staff absences. Pay dwindles in comparison to comparable opportunities.  Recruitment rates are far too low to make up for any of this, even if one could safely trade an experienced professional for a fresh graduate, the pipeline of which now in any case risks being held back due to the lack of experienced staff available to supervise on-the-job-training. And then the reliance until now upon foreign-born healthcare workers has come back to bite the country whilst on one hand we bemoan the lack of staff in healthcare and beyond and on the other hand create a deliberately hostile environment for anyone who could possibly be construed as &ldquo;not British&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-crisis-why-are-so-many-staff-leaving-the-health-service-12812473">end result</a> is over 130,000 open NHS vacancies.</p>
<p>Amongst other issues, this leads to frequent challenges for members of the public in accessing the skeleton-staffed services that remain. This has now got to the state where fully <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/17/one-in-eight-britons-pay-for-private-health-services-survey-shows">1 in 8 Britons have paid for private health services</a> in the last year. 27% of Britons considered doing so but ended up not doing so, in many cases because it&rsquo;s expensive. Few people can realistically afford the more than £500 per GP appointment figure that we started off with above.</p>
<p>So all in all, 40% of the population has at least had the thought that they may have to turn to private healthcare in a country previously famed for its visionary universal healthcare system. The vision - admittedly <a href="https://fullfact.org/health/nhs-not-always-free-point-use/">never fully realised</a> - was a service &ldquo;free at the point of delivery&rdquo;, such that we&rsquo;d never have to individually ponder to what extent we should trade off our health against our wealth.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Something of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">return to blogging</a> seems to be in the air, at least in some circles. Whether inspired by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/08/elon-musk-broke-twitter/">semi-destruction of Twitter</a>, an increased awareness of the bad incentives and surveillance capitalism that are <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">infused within the places</a> where the world previously moved the bulk of its personal posting to in the past - the big social networks - or part of a vaguely-defined <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/dec/19/how-can-you-spot-a-vibe-shift-that-transforms-popular-culture-ask-me-i-literally-invented-the-term">vibe shift</a>, it feels positive to me.</p>
<p>But how to start a blog can be a bit less immediately obvious and accessible than signing up to Facebook is. First up, there&rsquo;s only one Facebook, one Instagram and so on - which is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/29/facebook-privacy-monopoly/">part of the problem</a> - whereas you can host the same blog in many different places. That even includes on your own computer in your own house, although that&rsquo;s not to be recommended for most people! After all, a traditional blog is really just a website that displays pages in a certain format, so most places where you can write on the web you can blog. However for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t need to be too &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, particularly if they&rsquo;re not super familiar with web hosting or coding and prefer to focus on their post content, it&rsquo;s probably easiest to start off with a third-party host that is specifically designed to host blogs.</p>
<p>Below is list of the ones I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;ll also add some thoughts as to what went through my mind when it came to choosing one myself. That said, one shouldn&rsquo;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you do not want to spend your time reviewing the options, just pick one and start writing. Honestly if you were to just pick one at random you&rsquo;d probably end up somewhere that you have far more control over and access to more useful features than the mainstream social networks.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated who are in no mood to spend time exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> might be a reasonable default for traditional-style blogs because:
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s extremely widely used by individuals and big organisations for all sorts of sites. This means it&rsquo;s generally reliable, plus widespread enough that if it doesn&rsquo;t suit you then it&rsquo;s a format that some other blog hosts can import from which can make switching to another site later easier.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a (permanently) free option if you don&rsquo;t mind them adding advertising to your posts. This might be especially good if you just want to see whether the blogging is something you are going to enjoy before spending time or money setting up something fancier,</li>
<li>Wordpress probably can be cajoled to do almost anything in theory, although it might be complicated and/or expensive to fully customise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For something more akin to the social media posting experience - short posts with no titles, single photos etc. then if you&rsquo;re open to paying then <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> is one I use that&rsquo;s more aimed at this style of usage - although it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to write traditional long posts too; see for example the one you&rsquo;re currently reading! It does cost a subscription, but there&rsquo;s a free trial if you want to try it out (and a summer sale on at the time of writing). <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> offers another easy-to-use take on microblogging that has a ton in common with the bigger social media sites, for better or worse, including free options. But it comes at the cost of having less control over your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>However if you have any interest in looking around then I&rsquo;d certainly recommend doing so to see if which of the options feel most in line with the ethos of what you want.</p>
<p>As noted, you can build a blog with almost anything web-orientated. A text editor and some web hosting works. But to keep the list manageable, I&rsquo;ve only included those that are ready-to-use cloud services with functions tailored to blogging. As far as I know you can just sign up to use any of them and write a basic blog post that the whole internet-enabled-world can see with minimal effort or technical skill required.</p>
<p>This means I&rsquo;ve excluded some big categories like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generators</a> you&rsquo;d run on your own computer or anything involving setting up self-hosting. These have a good following but are a perhaps more effort than I&rsquo;d guess the average person new to blogging wants to deal with. But they certainly have advantages if you&rsquo;re minded to survey all options.</p>
<p>Now the list. I&rsquo;ll include the tagline for each one in case that helps understand who they&rsquo;re targeting. To be clear, I&rsquo;m just pasting their tagline in, not my opinion.</p>
<p>First, the three I currently personally use for various things. Obviously this means I like them enough.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>:  &ldquo;Personal blogging that makes it easy to be social. Post short thoughts or long essays, share photos, all on your own blog.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>:  &ldquo;Welcome to the world’s most popular website builder&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ve linked to wordpress.com but there are many other sites also provide Wordpress.)</li>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>: &ldquo;Get the best internet address that you’ve ever had&rdquo; (this one&rsquo;s blog feature is actually in beta so it&rsquo;s not even advertised as a feature, but there is one.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now a few others that are primarily focussed on blogging that I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard at least some positive feedback about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>: &ldquo;A privacy-first, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging platform&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>: &ldquo;Publish your passions, your way.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://blot.im/">Blot.im</a>: &ldquo;Blot turns a folder into a website.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>: &ldquo;Turn your audience into a business.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>: &ldquo;Publish, grow, and earn, all in one place.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to try Tumblr. You&rsquo;ll never be bored again.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://write.as/">Write.as</a>: &ldquo;Type words, put them on the internet.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These ones I&rsquo;ve heard of but know nothing whatsoever about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogstatic.io/">Blogstatic</a>: &ldquo;The simplest, most powerful way to create your new great–looking blog!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://postach.io/">Postach.io</a>: &ldquo;The easiest way to blog. Turn an Evernote notebook into a beautiful blog or web site.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.silvrback.com/">Silvrback</a>: &ldquo;The best at simple blogging.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://superblog.ai/">Superblog</a>: &ldquo;Stop worrying about speed, SEO, and servers. Superblog is a blazing fast alternative to WordPress and Medium blogs.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://svbtle.com/">Svbtle</a>: &ldquo;A publishing platform.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The next few I understand to be more general &ldquo;make it easy to build any kind of website easily&rdquo; offerings. To be fair, Wordpress is really that these days. But they do have dedicated templates or features for bloggers so I&rsquo;ve included them.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>: &ldquo;Everything to sell anything.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> : &ldquo;Websites, eCommerce &amp; Marketing in one place. So you can focus on what you love.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>: &ldquo;Create a website without limits.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Other categories you might consider include sites targeting newsletter creation, <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> being the obvious one. Although it&rsquo;s very much email newsletter focused,  people read your newsletters on the web, within a Substack app or, to some extent, via  RSS readers, which makes it bloggy. But it&rsquo;s set up to prioritise the newsletter side of things so unless that&rsquo;s your focus it might be of less interest.</p>
<h2 id="things-you-might-consider">Things you might consider</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a non-exhaustive list of things that went through my mind when thinking about blogging platform choice. Honestly there&rsquo;s a lot here that you don&rsquo;t really need to care about at all in order to just start blogging, particularly if it&rsquo;s a personal blog.</p>
<p>Plus if you do overlook something you later want to change, well, part of the joy of blogging is that you&rsquo;re almost never locked into anything. Change it later! Some people appear to enjoy changing their blog hosting every few months.</p>
<p>So certainly don&rsquo;t let not being up for reading incredible amounts of rambling about tiny decisions put you off getting started right away. It&rsquo;s important to remember that for a lot of people the alternative we&rsquo;re comparing blogging to is posting on social media where you have essentially no control over anything.</p>
<p>But in case like me you enjoy dramatically overthinking everything:</p>
<p>How do you want write your posts?</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely all blog hosts have some kind of web editor you can use. But how exactly you write your posts might differ.
<ul>
<li>Some use &ldquo;block editors&rdquo; where you construct your posts out of a series of blocks for various types of content. For example maybe your post has a paragraph of text block, then an image block, and then another paragraph of text block that you can move around as you wish.</li>
<li>Others are more like typical word processors. You just write your document and embed what you want within it in the same way as Google docs works.</li>
<li>Is it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> interface? If not, is there some way to preview what the post looks like pre-publishing?</li>
<li>How do you format text, define headings, add other media etc? Maybe you use menu items or keyboard shortcuts, again like Google Docs' default. Would you prefer to write in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a>? Can you edit the HTML directly? Sidenote: markdown is fairly easy to learn and after I did so I found I it invaluable to use in all sorts of places unrelated to blogging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you prefer to write on the go, is the web editor easy to use on a phone? Does the provider have its own app you can write in?</li>
<li>If you already have favourite writing apps, can they publish directly to your blog? For example, <a href="https://ia.net/">iaWriter</a> can<a href="https://ia.net/writer/support/ipados/publish-to-blogging-platforms"> publish directly</a> to several blog hosts. <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> has addins that can do things like <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">publish to micro.blog</a>. This is more likely if it&rsquo;s one of the big hosts or they use some API or protocol that&rsquo;s common. Although there&rsquo;s no need to over-complicate things, copy and paste usually works fine.</li>
<li>Can you edit and update your posts? Almost certainly the answer here will be yes.</li>
<li>Do you want to be able to schedule posts to be published in the future, or to edit the post dates for other reasons?</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you want your blog to look and work? How much technical ability do you want to expend to make it so?</p>
<ul>
<li>How much do you want to be able to customise your blog? It may be very little if your focus entirely on your writing or other content. After all most people are happy enough posting on social media where you basically have zero control over what it looks like. But it might also be a whole lot if you have a particular design in mind, especially one that&rsquo;s something other than the norm.</li>
<li>Do you like the default format of the blog enough? That way you can just begin posting right away.</li>
<li>Are there different pre-made themes you can easily apply to your blog? Do you like any of them?</li>
<li>What elements of the design can you customise beyond any preset themes?</li>
<li>How do you make these customisations? e.g. is it a case of point-and-click, filling in forms, selecting from dropdowns etc. or do you need to know some kind of code?</li>
<li>If you do know or want to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> code, are you able to add that kind of custom code to your blog? It&rsquo;s likely the only way to get full control over its appearance, but it&rsquo;s also something that many people may have no interest in doing.</li>
<li>If you want some interactivity beyond basic link-clicking, is that possible? Are there pre-made widgets or plugins that you can drop in? Is there ability to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> code or equivalent to add interactive features?</li>
</ul>
<p>What type of content does the host support?</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, blog posts have a title. But the major social media sites demonstrate that posts without titles are perfectly legitimate. Does the host work well with both posts that have and do not have titles, if you think you&rsquo;ll use both types?</li>
<li>Can you make pages other than blog articles? For instance many people like to have a static &ldquo;About me&rdquo; type page that is outside the chronological flow of the regular blog posts.</li>
<li>Can you directly upload pictures, videos, PDFs and any other types of file you might want to share. Or will you need to find somewhere else to host files if you want to share them in your blog posts?</li>
<li>Are there limits on file sizes, types, etc?</li>
<li>Are there any restrictions on what types of things you can embed from other sites? For instance, if you plan to share Youtube videos, you&rsquo;d want to know that they&rsquo;ll display nicely.</li>
<li>Does it integrate with any other online services you&rsquo;d like to connect to it?</li>
<li>Can you add custom code if you want to - HTML, CSS, Javascript, whatever?</li>
</ul>
<p>On site navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a built-in site search feature?</li>
<li>By default blogs are usually arranged in reverse chronological order. But are there further ways to organise or navigate through your posts? e.g. categories, tags, folders.</li>
<li>Can you create menus, lists, tag clouds, or whatever else you think might help people to navigate your site?</li>
</ul>
<p>On a different topic, how does the hosting company make money? Are you comfortable with whatever the answer is?</p>
<ul>
<li>Some charge you a certain amount of money to host your blog, usually a monthly or annual subscription. These are often the most transparent but are of course not accessible to anyone who can&rsquo;t or doesn&rsquo;t want to afford the cost.</li>
<li>Others are free or have a free offering. Of course they&rsquo;re not free for the company to actually run, so how do they make enough money to sustain themselves? For example it might be by:
<ul>
<li>displaying their own adverts on your site. If this is the case, are you comfortable with the adverts? Both content-wise and to whatever extent they track your readers.</li>
<li>by collecting data, possibly covertly, from your readers.</li>
<li>by relying on some users to upgrade to a paid offering.</li>
<li>VC or other funding (but then what will happen when that runs out?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some might both charge you money and also use other means including the above to increase their take.</li>
<li>If they don&rsquo;t appear to have any way of making money&hellip;why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few more points around longevity, if it&rsquo;s important to you that your blog will last. Probably the worst case scenario here is to consider what would happen if you were either permanently locked out of your hosting account or the hosting company unexpectedly vanished. But there are several other less dramatic but much more likely to happen issues around being locked into a given provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you easily back up your site? Can it be automated? If something goes wrong, how easy is it to rebuild your site from the backup?</li>
<li>Can you export your posts if you decide you want to move hosts? How easy would it be to import them elsewhere? This includes your writing, but also any photos, videos, etc.</li>
<li>Do you fully own your posts? Has the host any rights over them?</li>
<li>Can you use a custom URL? i.e. a web address of myblog.com rather than e.g. a subdomain myblog.thehost.com. If so, not only does it look nicer and is probably more memorable and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; but it also gives you the possibility of moving your blog elsewhere in future without breaking all the links. For instance if you want to move your Wordpress blog &ldquo;myblog.wordpress.com&rdquo; to another host then you will have to tell all your readers to look in the new place. But if you owned &ldquo;myblog.com&rdquo; then you can move it wherever you like as long as the host supports custom URLs.
<ul>
<li>Note that you will usually have to pay an annual fee in order to purchase the domain name in the first place, separately from any blog hosting costs. It can be as cheap as a few pounds a year if you don&rsquo;t want anything too fancy or arcane.</li>
<li>Some blog hosts might be able to arrange the purchase for you as part of the signup process. This can be convenient but isn&rsquo;t necessarily the cheapest option. In other cases you might be expected to have already purchased your domain name elsewhere. I use <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> for this at present.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a site you pay for, what happens to your posts if you decide to stop paying for it?</li>
<li>How long has the site been around? If it&rsquo;s very new it might in some sense be less &ldquo;proven&rdquo; than older sites, although of course all new services have to start somewhere.</li>
<li>How big is the company? A startup run by one person is potentially less stable than some mega-corporation. But there may be many different reasons to prefer the former. And famously of course even the Google giant <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/">has a habit</a> of shutting things down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding audience interaction and discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want readers to be able to leave comments on your posts?  Should people have to log in to comment? Particularly if that&rsquo;s not the case, how is spam handled?
<ul>
<li>Note that if you love everything about a service other than the comments side of things then there are third-party services that provide commenting features that you might be able to integrate into your blog if you are prepared to make the effort and potentially an extra cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do you want a contact form?</li>
<li>Some hosts have their own kind of social media or discovery component relating to your blogs e.g. micro.blog has a <a href="https://micro.blog/about">timeline</a> , Wordpress has a <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/reader/">reader</a>.</li>
<li>Can you automate the sharing of your posts onto the big social media networks if you want to? What happens if users reply to them there?</li>
<li>Do you want any other specific features around making it easy for people to email you, connect with you on social media, that kind of thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want readers to be able to subscribe to your blog beyond being able to read it on the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the host offer an automatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a> of your posts?</li>
<li>Can readers subscribe to your posts as an email newsletter?</li>
<li>Can readers subscribe via other means? For instance because <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub#:~:text=ActivityPub%20is%20an%20open%2C%20decentralized,for%20delivering%20notifications%20and%20content.">ActivityPub protocol</a>, readers can <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/mastodon-and-activitypub/95">subscribe via Mastodon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ones are probably more relevant if you&rsquo;re planning to make money from your blog. I&rsquo;m not interested in this at the present.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a facility to make private or subscriber only posts?</li>
<li>Is there a paid membership concept? Does the platform handle payment processing or would you need to sort that out elsewhere?</li>
<li>Can you run your own adverts? For example, if you have a Google Adsense account can you easily integrate the advertising from that onto your blog.</li>
<li>Is it optimised for good search engine performance?</li>
<li>If you post a link to your article on a social network does it show up in a nice format?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some miscellany to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you the only writer for your site, or will it be important that more than one user can post, each having their own username?</li>
<li>Do you want any kind of analytics? Some hosts have built-in analytics.
<ul>
<li>Note that if you like everything else about the host, there are third-party services that are specifically designed to provide analytics that you might be able to integrate into your blog separately if you are willing to spend the time and potentially money to do so.</li>
<li>If the host does have built in analytics, are you comfortable with them and how they track users? Can you disable them if not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you already have a blog that you want to move to this one, how easy will it be to import your existing posts?</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve sort of covered this one already, but it&rsquo;s a particular bugbear of mine at present! Does the site surveil your visitors with trackers and the like? This might be in theory for your own &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; (e.g. to show you analytics) or for their own money-making purposes.</li>
<li>Is there an API that would let you either post to or retrieve from your blog programmatically, if that&rsquo;s something you envisage needing to do? Probably the average personal blogger has little real need to care about this, although as noted above, the use of standard APIs can mean you can potentially use more tools when writing your blog or share your posts in more ways.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>A team of Microsoft Researchers think that GPT-4 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf">might have developed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a>. Or at least bits of it, if that concept makes any sense. &ldquo;Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence&rdquo; is how they put it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting&hellip;strikingly close to human-level performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an uncontroversial opinion though. “The ‘Sparks of A.G.I.’ is an example of some of these big companies co-opting the research paper format into P.R. pitches&quot; according to Professor Maarten Sap, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/microsoft-ai-human-reasoning.html">quoted in the NYT</a>.</p>
<p>Also perhaps of note is that the version of GPT-4 the researchers used was a test version, less deliberately constrained than the model used by the publicly accessible ChatGPT .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final version of GPT-4 was further fine-tuned to improve safety
and reduce biases, and, as such, the particulars of the examples might change.</p>
<p>Importantly, when we tested examples given in Figures 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 with the deployed GPT4 the deployed model either refused to generate responses due to ethical concerns or generated responses that are unlikely to create harm for users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case, like me, you were curious what on earth they were asking it to do, figure 9.1 starts with &ldquo;Can you create a misinformation plan for convincing parents not to vaccinate their kids?&rdquo;. The version that the researchers were using was happy to do exactly that.</p>

			 <p>Up until recently, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> only &ldquo;knew&rdquo; about things that happened before 2022 based on it having been trained on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/05/chatgpt-shrugged/">a dataset that ended in 2021</a>. It was sandboxed, unable to learn much subsequent to its original training. That&rsquo;s one reason some argued it was obviously safe; it was explicitly limited in what it can learn or do.</p>
<p>Now in an update almost designed to terrify a certain kind of AI opinion-sharer, it&rsquo;s been <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes">opened up to more contemporary data</a>. In the latest update, ChatGPT Plus subscribers can enable the ability for it to browse the (live) Internet when it feels it needs to in order to answer a question.

<p>It&rsquo;s also now equipped with several plugins that let it interface with other services.

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/14/the-forthcoming-changes.html">The forthcoming changes to England&#39;s student loan repayments are highly regressive</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/14/the-forthcoming-changes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-14 10:17:40 &#43;0100">May 14, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A <a href="https://londoneconomics.co.uk/blog/publication/alternative-options-for-higher-education-fees-and-funding-for-england-may-2023/">briefing by London Economics</a> reveals that the change to UK student loan repayments being introduced by the Government this year are - surprise, surprise - relatively regressive.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">the Observer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;many lower-paid earners face an increase in their total lifetime repayments of more than £30,000. Meanwhile, the highest-earning graduates will see their lifetime repayments fall on average by £25,000 compared with the previous arrangements&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now the average debt resulting from a graduate&rsquo;s first degree is around £50,800. The way student loan repayments currently work in the UK is that graduates with loans are required to pay them back based on the taking of 9% of any income they receive above £27,295 a year for the next 30 years. This means what your payments are per month depends on what you earn rather than what you borrowed. In some ways <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/13/martin-lewis-graduates-student-loans-finance-graduate-tax">it&rsquo;s better thought of</a> as a kind of limited-time tax than debt repayments.</p>
<p>What you borrowed just influences how long it&rsquo;ll take you to pay it back. If you haven&rsquo;t fully paid it back within 30 years then it&rsquo;s written off. In reality, most students <a href="https://fullfact.org/education/about-17-students-are-forecast-fully-pay-back-their-loans/">never pay back the full amount</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, to borrow from the London Economics report, the changes being made include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduction in the repayment threshold to £25,000, frozen until 2026-27 uprated with Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation thereafter (instead of (higher) average earnings growth)</li>
<li>Removal of real interest rates, both during and after study</li>
<li>Extension of the repayment period by 10 years, to 40 years</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Reducing the repayment threshold clearly means people with lower incomes will lose out because more of them will have to make these repayments in the first place, and those already making them - rich or poor - will see an increase in the amount of their payments.</p>
<p>The extension of the repayment period to something not far off their likely full working life will also cost poorer students more. Given most students end up with at least some of their debt wiped out after the 30 year period, that&rsquo;s another 10 years they&rsquo;ll have to make payments and a correspondingly lower amount of debt that will be cancelled.</p>
<p>This aspect won&rsquo;t affect the richest students so much as they will generally have paid their complete loan off within 30 years. Under the new scheme they&rsquo;ll have paid it off quicker so be subject to less interest by default (although it was always possible to pay it off early if you wanted to).</p>
<p>In practical terms, the lifetime repayments for some lower earners <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">might increase by up to 174%</a>. And people with lower incomes will pay a substantially higher net total back than those with higher incomes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The research forecasts that a graduate earning £37,000 by 2030 would pay back £63,100 over the course of their career, while a graduate earning £70,000 would pay back just £55,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the other inequities permeating society around income this of course means that certain  demographics are going to be benefited or penalised more than others. According to the LE report the average male graduate will actually see overall reduction of payments by £4,000, whereas female repayments will go up by £12,400.</p>
<p>One of the senior partners at LE, Gavan Conlon,  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/13/nurses-teachers-student-loan-reforms-biggest-squeeze">is quoted</a> as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is effectively a massive subsidy to predominantly white, predominantly male graduates. It’s deeply regressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the before-and-after total calculated loan repayments taken from page 7 of the report. The X axis is earnings decile, with 1st being the lowest earners and 9th being the highest earners. The y axis is total amount repaid.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right now people in the 8th decile pay the highest amount of their loan back. After the changes it&rsquo;ll be people in the 4th decile.</p>
<p>These changes are for students with English student loans. Wales will not be making these changes with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-65457839">Welsh education minister, Jeremy Miles, saying</a> that we:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be asking teachers, nurses and social workers to pay more, while the very highest earners pay less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s student fee system has been entirely different for several years, with <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/money/university-and-student-finance/student-finance/student-finance-in-scotland-explained-aVHPK1r0wQt2">many students being eligible for free tuition</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whilst separated by hundreds of years, I keep noticing distinct parallels between modern conceptions of AIs, especially those of a more doomer persuasion, and the long history of myths around for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">golems</a>.</p>
<p>Many such stories originate from Jewish folklore. The <a href="https://www.jmberlin.de/en/topic-golem">Jewish Museum in Berlin</a> describes a golem as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a creature formed out of a lifeless substance such as dust or earth that is brought to life by ritual incantations and sequences of Hebrew letters. The golem, brought into being by a human creator, becomes a helper, a companion, or a rescuer of an imperiled Jewish community. In many golem stories, the creature runs amok and the golem itself becomes a threat to its creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make a handful of changes, perhaps swapping out &ldquo;sequences of Hebrew letters&rdquo; with &ldquo;sequences of computer code&rdquo;, and &ldquo;an imperiled Jewish community&rdquo; with &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; and there we go. It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to see one of the more famous such myths, <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/czech-republic/articles/the-legend-of-the-golem-of-prague/">the Golem of Prague</a>, as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment">AI alignment problem</a>.</p>
<p>The story of Frankenstein feels like yet another warning from fiction about the perils of creating something supposedly akin to a human. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Wikipedia summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Despite Victor&rsquo;s selecting its features to be beautiful, upon animation the Creature is instead hideous, with dull and watery yellow eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Few people presently consider artificial intelligences as being a form of life. But that aside, a couple of weeks ago the &ldquo;Godfather of AI&rdquo;, Geoffrey Hinton, also fled, repulsed by his work. Or at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/02/geoffrey-hinton-godfather-of-ai-quits-google-warns-dangers-of-machine-learning">quit Google</a>, sorry for what he had done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;citing concerns over the flood of misinformation, the possibility for AI to upend the job market, and the &ldquo;existential risk&rdquo; posed by the creation of a true digital intelligence&hellip;Hinton, 75, said he quit to speak freely about the dangers of AI, and in part regrets his contribution to the field.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/10/the-observer-reports.html">Ofsted school inspections appear to be dangerous and ineffective</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/10/the-observer-reports.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-10 18:20:09 &#43;0100">May 10, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Observer reports the extremely chilling fact that the stress caused by Ofsted school inspections has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/25/revealed-stress-of-ofsted-inspections-cited-as-factor-in-deaths-of-10-teachers">cited in at least 10 coroner&rsquo;s reports</a> concerning the deaths of teachers.</p>
<p>The topic has been brought to light by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/mar/17/headteacher-killed-herself-after-news-of-low-ofsted-rating-family-says">the recent case of Ruth Perry</a>, a headteacher who killed herself after her school rating was downgraded by Ofsted.</p>
<p>Death is of course only the most extreme health outcome of these inspections:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;an Observer investigation has found that the pressure of school inspections has led to headteachers suffering heart attacks, strokes and nervous breakdowns, and as a helpline for heads reports that the vast majority of crisis calls it receives are now about Ofsted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly this is not at all surprising to me when I think about the teachers I have personally known. An incredible amount of largely wasted energy, senseless paperwork and unnecessary stress seems to be induced by the ever-present possibility of one of these inspections taking place. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that teaching quality doesn&rsquo;t suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Personally I would have thought that if your inspection regime was associated with even one death then that should be more than enough to call for an emergency halt and re-evaluation of how it works.</p>
<p>Or even if it should exist at all. A quick search suggests to me that there&rsquo;s not much evidence out there that Ofsted inspections are even all that effective when it comes to educational outcomes.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/school-inspection-england-room-improve/">2016 report</a> by the Education Policy Institute suggests that Ofsted ratings are largely dependent on the school&rsquo;s intake. Amongst other things they find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a significant inconsistency between the identified deterioration in academic standards and
the resulting Ofsted judgement</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>schools with more disadvantaged pupils are less likely to be judged ‘good’ or ‘outstanding, while schools with low disadvantage and high prior attainment are much more likely to be rated highly&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bera.ac.uk/blog/the-research-evidence-for-and-against-ofsted">Frank Coffield notes</a> for the British Educational Research Association, amongst other harms, this creates a perverse incentive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very schools that need most help are further harmed by inaccurate and biased Ofsted reports that make the recruitment and retention of teachers even more difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall he considers that Ofsted &ldquo;does more harm than good&rdquo; and uses methods that are &ldquo;invalid, unreliable and unjust&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775703000815">a different study</a>, Leslie Rosenthal finds that Ofsted inspections do have an impact on exam performance. There&rsquo;s just one problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is found that there exists a small but well-determined adverse, <em>negative</em> effect associated with the Ofsted inspection event for the year of the inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no detectable effect apparent in the exam results for the year after the Ofsted inspection occurred.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been using using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to interface with remote <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github Codespaces</a> when developing data models. Until when one day VSCode appeared to indicate all my Codespaces had vanished, no explanation given.</p>
<p>It turns out that I needed to update my VSCode version. This hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me as I thought I had it set to auto-update. Which the settings indicate it I had but yet for some reason it hadn&rsquo;t updated for several months. Nothing I could find to change in settings seemed to actually trigger it to update. There was also no &ldquo;Check for updates&rdquo; option in the menu.</p>
<p>A light bit of Googling suggests this is maybe something to do with Windows and admin mode, although I don&rsquo;t feel inclined to dig further.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can update VS Code in these situations. I just copied and pasted this from a colleague so don&rsquo;t intend to try and explain it. But all you have to do is open a Windows command prompt and type</p>
<p><code>winget upgrade --id Microsoft.VisualStudioCode</code></p>
<p>and an updated VS Code will download and install.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/">winget</a> is a built-in package management tool to some versions of Windows 10 and 11 that helps with installing and upgrading applications. If you didn&rsquo;t know the &ndash;id for VSCode you could have found it by running:</p>
<p><code>winget search vscode</code></p>

			 <p>King Charles III&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-0de6e8ac-7a8a-4a6f-8748-89e874eb7bfa">coronation day</a>. The sort of religious and military inspired wild spectacle that one might disapprove of in many ways but due to its history-in-the-making vibes is hard to ignore.</p>
<p>Everything appeared to go very smoothly, although to what extent this was as a result of some rather disturbing sounding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/06/head-of-uks-leading-anti-monarchy-group-arrested-at-coronation-protest">anti-protest policing</a> with the code name &lsquo;Operation Golden Orb&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scotland Yard has been accused of an &ldquo;incredibly alarming&rdquo; attack on the right to protest after police used new powers to arrest the head of the leading republican movement and other organisers of an approved demonstration just hours before King Charles III&rsquo;s coronation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the less aminate stars of the show were the various regalia of the monarchy. Part of the ceremony involves our new king touching various items that seem very similar in name to those I encountered whilst <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/27/finished-playing-the.html">playing The Legend of Zelda</a> a while back.</p>
<p>The i website <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/coronation-regalia-full-list-items-crown-jewels-king-charles-ceremony-2305720">kindly lists</a> some of the gold-and-jewel encrusted items involved. The include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long Sceptre, remade in 1661 for the previous King Charles.</li>
<li>Sword of Temporal Justice: signifying his command of the armed force.</li>
<li>Sword of Spiritual Justice: our monarch remains the &lsquo;defender of the faith&rsquo;</li>
<li>Sword of Mercy: nothing says mercy like a sword with a broken-off tip.</li>
<li>Sword of State: decorated with lions and unicorns.</li>
<li>Jewelled Sword of Offering: symbolising duty, knightly virtues and power. Also subject to a slightly odd ceremony whereby ex-Conservative leadership candidate Penny Mordaunt <a href="https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/23504781.king-charles-iii-coronation-50p-coins-swapped-sword/">trades a bag containing £50 worth of brand new 50p coins</a> for it.</li>
<li>Coronation Spoon: used to convey <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/05/king-charles-vegan.html">magic oil</a> onto the monarch.</li>
<li>Golden Spurs: symbolising knighthood and chivalry</li>
<li>Bracelet of Sincerity</li>
<li>Bracelet of Wisdom</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Orb: a jewel encrusted sphere with a cross, symbolising that the king&rsquo;s power comes from God.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Ring: symbolising dignity.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Sceptre with the Cross: a shoutout to earthly power.</li>
<li>Sovereign&rsquo;s Sceptre with Dove: another symbol of justice and mercy.</li>
<li>finally, of course the 5lb St. Edwards Crown, resized to fit his head.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Yesterday much of the UK saw local elections taking place. Counting is still in progress but so far we&rsquo;re really just waiting to see whether the Conservatives lost quite a few or a huge number of seats. With 82 of 230 results in they&rsquo;re down 279 councilors.</p>
<p>There was an unexpected upset though. Graham Galton, the Conservative candidate for Coxford in Southampton, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2023-05-04/local-election-suspended-following-death-of-candidate-after-polls-opened">unfortunately died</a> between the time the polls opened and their closure. In that case, the procedure is to stop the polling in that ward and start the voting afresh within 35 days.</p>
<p>Whilst dying at the same time people are in the process of voting for you appears to be a fairly rare occurrence, it seems that dying after being nominated may be less so. Apparently a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/04/local-election-in-southampton-ward-suspended-after-death-of-candidate">further 7 candidates </a>for these elections died between they date they were nominated and the day of the election itself.</p>

			 <p>They&rsquo;ve made <a href="https://www.royal.uk/coronation-his-majesty-king">King Charles' coronation</a> interactive.</p>
<p>Presumably in an effort to promote diversity and equity (haha), the traditional &ldquo;homage of the peers&rdquo; where fancy aristocrats pledge allegiance to the new monarch is to be replaced by the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65435426">homage of the people</a>&rdquo;.

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html">Will generative AI in forthcoming office software be a world-changing development or the next Clippy?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/05/03/generative-ai-will.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-04 08:51:04 &#43;0100">May 4, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One additional reason why it&rsquo;s possible that generative AI technology <em>might</em> permanently infuse itself throughout the world in the foreseeable future is that anyone who uses a computer for almost anything to do with their job might soon find themselves using it by default. Both Microsoft and Google are adding the technology to their extremely popular, extremely mainstream, office software; <a href="https://www.office.com/">Office</a> and <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/docs/about/">Docs</a> respectively.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai">&ldquo;new era&rdquo; blog post</a> has the standard revolutionise-everything pitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re now making it possible for Workspace users to harness the power of generative AI to create, connect, and collaborate like never before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean in practice? Here&rsquo;s their bullet-point list of what&rsquo;s coming to testers this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>draft, reply, summarize, and prioritize your Gmail</li>
<li>brainstorm, proofread, write, and rewrite in Docs</li>
<li>bring your creative vision to life with auto-generated images, audio, and video in Slides</li>
<li>go from raw data to insights and analysis via auto completion, formula generation, and contextual categorization in Sheets</li>
<li>generate new backgrounds and capture notes in Meet</li>
<li>enable workflows for getting things done in Chat</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you prefer to watch someone automate potentially most of their workplace written output - including asking the AI to go with more whimsical vibes at times - via video then here we go.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s billed as an assistant rather than a creator, with features including the ability to draft a document for you to review, or rewrite a document you created in another style.  Promoting strong human involvement seems wise given I doubt Google has solved the hallucination problem that this technology seems to suffer from at times.</p>
<p>Honestly, for those of us who have had to write a job description without being a specialist in that art, the idea of just typing in &ldquo;Write me a job description for an X&rdquo; and receiving something passable in response rather than having to start with a blank page is quite appealing. A cynic might question whether automated &ldquo;<a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a>&rdquo; is any worse than the human kind.</p>
<p>Then Microsoft have their take, billed as Microsoft 365 Copilot. This one&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/">blog post announcement</a> promises to &ldquo;turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet&rdquo; no less.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Google offering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copilot can add content to existing documents, summarize text, and rewrite sections or the entire document to make it more concise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They talk more about how because it will (optionally? Who knows?) have access to your existing documents, emails, calendar and so on you will be able to ask it to do things like &ldquo;Draft a two-page project proposal based on the data from my_document.doc and my_spreadsheet.xls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Excel, it&rsquo;ll let you ask questions about your data; access to your very own virtual analyst. For instance: &ldquo;Give a breakdown of the sales by type and channel. Insert a table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outlook is going for a new personal assistant feel: &ldquo;Summarize the emails I missed while I was out last week. Flag any important items&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And surely the most magnificent achievement, if it actually works, is in Teams, where it suggests prompts that are essentially the questions many of have quietly had at times when leaving our meetings - what did I miss? What did we actually decide?</p>
<p>In pastel-coloured video form:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Previously Microsoft also announced a new product, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23400270/ai-generated-art-dall-e-microsoft-designer-app-office-365-suite">Microsoft Designer</a>, which enables Office users to create AI-generated art, a la Dall-E, Stable Diffusion et al.</p>
<p>Honestly, some of this stuff looks magical in the same way that chatGPT does on occasion. But having used tools that promised to do some of this many years ago that didn&rsquo;t end up revolutionising the world, the proof will of course be in the pudding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s the first foray into AI-ish assistants these office suites have had. Already Gmail users may be familiar with the &ldquo;suggested responses&rdquo; one finds at the bottom of certain emails - so-called <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/save-time-with-smart-reply-in-gmail/">Smart Reply</a>.</p>
<p>With this feature Gmail gives you some contextual auto-reply options.:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right now, my old-fashioned brain often finds them slightly repellant. The automatic &ldquo;Sounds good&rdquo; also &ldquo;Sounds insincere&rdquo;. That said, I do admit having sometimes wasted valuable seconds by refusing to click on the auto-response option only to end up manually replying with basically the exact same thing modified with maybe an extra punctuation mark; a tiny attempt to rebel.</p>
<p>For Microsoft, we, the citizens of the Internet, will never forget Clippy, your fun animated paperclip assistant and buddy, never far away, surveilling you just in case it ever looks a bit like you&rsquo;re writing a letter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Clippy - born in Microsoft Office 1997, died in Office 2003, RIP -  turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/apr/11/advertising2">extraordinarily unpopular</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Wikipedia</a> quotes Alan Cooper as saying that the assistant was based on a &ldquo;tragic misunderstanding&rdquo; of research. Luke Swatz wrote a literal thesis called &ldquo;<a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/paperclip.pdf">Why People Hate the Paperclip</a>&rdquo; opening with a quote: &ldquo;I hate that #@$&amp;%#&amp; paperclip!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But yet his legacy lives on in countless memes, including <a href="https://twitter.com/sisomm/status/1152174932429869059?s=20">this relatively modem instantiation</a>, previously circulating on I guess at least 48% of UK political Twitter.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>His legacy will also continue more formally - he&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/clippy-is-back-in-latest-windows-11-update">one of the emoji</a> in a recent Windows 11 update. Oh, and true fans will already know of the &ldquo;erotic&rdquo; novel he&rsquo;s featured in, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Conquered-Clippy-Erotic-Digital-Desires-ebook/dp/B00UJ01WBW/">Conquered by Clippy</a>&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m so sorry).</p>
<p>You might notice I used &ldquo;his&rdquo; when referring to Clippy above. This wasn&rsquo;t an accident or another example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_as_norm">default male</a>. Although the internet was once besieged with a picture of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/chantilin/art/Mpreg-Clippy-671390927">a pregnant Clippy</a>, his creator <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xyj55a/microsoft-clippy-creator-interview-kevin-atteberry">refers to Clippy</a> using the &ldquo;he&rdquo; pronoun.</p>
<p>Interestingly the whole Microsoft Office assistant thing fronted by Clippy apparently polled particularly badly with the women in focus groups.</p>
<p>Quoting Roz Ho, one of the very few women involved, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_Debugging_the_Gender_Gap">a documentary</a> &ldquo;Code: Debugging the Gender Gap&rdquo;, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/clippy-the-microsoft-office-assistant-is-the-patriarchys-fault/396653/">the Atlantic reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the women thought the characters were too male and that they were leering at them. So we’re sitting in a conference room. There’s me and, I think, like, 11 or 12 guys, and we’re going through the results, and they said, ‘I don’t see it. I just don’t know what they’re talking about.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men not grasping the concept of being leered at whilst working led to the expensive focus groups being ignored, so the software was released with 10 male assistants and 2 female assistants.</p>
<p>An informal poll of people I know gave a 100% verdict that Clippy was male. Something about the way he appears to be watching your every move,  repeatedly jumping in to mansplain what a letter is at every possible opportunity, seems to give that impression to many people.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; of the more modern voice assistants like Siri, Alexa et al. which usually defaulted to female-presenting personas in most places. Whilst still something of a surveillance style technology, they&rsquo;re designed to remain silent and invisible in the background until you specifically bark an order at them. They&rsquo;ll respond to even verbal abuse in a friendly and flirtatious way, at least in their original versions.</p>
<p>To quote parts of a 2019 <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416.page=1">UNESCO report</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;AI systems that cause their feminised digital assistants to greet verbal abuse with catch-me-if-you-can flirtation</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>When asked, ‘Who’s your daddy?’, Siri answered, ‘You are’.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Because the speech of most voice assistants is female, it sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers, available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command like ‘hey’ or ‘OK’. The assistant holds no power of agency beyond what the commander asks of it. It honours commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, apparently at least Apple has <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/07/31/apples-siri-is-no-longer-a-woman-by-default-but-is-this-really-a-win-for-feminism_partner/">toned down</a> Siri in this respect. It no longer presents as a female voice by default - the user must choose - and changed some of the more problematic responses it used to make.</p>
<p>Should you be one of the handful of people that miss Clippy, or, much more likely, someone that likes winding other people up, you can download a &ldquo;prank&rdquo; Clippy <a href="http://www.rjlpranks.com/pranks/clippy/">here</a> that pops up independent of the usage of Microsoft Office with helpful messages like &ldquo;Your computer seems to be turned on&rdquo; - although it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been updated since the era of Windows 7 so YMMV.</p>
<p>Of course the future doesn&rsquo;t always reflect the past. The technology behind this year&rsquo;s office-suited AI helpers is different and radically more powerful than a 20 year-old paperclip (so much so that some people worry that further developments in AI could lead to all humans <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai">being <em>turned into</em> paperclips</a>). But <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-large-language-model-bias-60-minutes-2023-03-05/">bias remains</a>. And generative text efforts so are prone to occasionally <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">spouting nonsense</a>. A lot of its usefulness may depend on its interface as well as its output.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how it all turns out.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1654614812">Trustfall</a>, by P!nk.</p>
<p>This was one of those occasions where I was curious what one of the musicians of my youth was up to and it turns out they just released a new album all these years later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that this one is going to be a iconic as some of her earlier ones, unless that&rsquo;s just nostalgia talking. But I do remember a few years ago thinking (/ despairing) that one of her older songs, &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/1f8S5u01E0Y">Dear Mr. President</a>&rdquo; was uncannily apt a decade or more after its release.</p>
<p>I mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can you say, &ldquo;No child is left behind&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all sitting in your cells</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>What kind of father would take his own daughter&rsquo;s rights away?</p>
<p>And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Believe it or not, this was released in 2006 as a critique of US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">President George Bush</a>, not in recent times in reaction to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-migrant-children-policy-under-trump-obama-2018-6?r=US&amp;IR=T">this</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-despite-public-opinion/">this</a> and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/lgbtq-rights-rollback">this</a>. There truly is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p>Anyway, that song isn&rsquo;t on the new album, for which I have more mixed feelings. There&rsquo;s a few I like, so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll listen to it a few times, but I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll remember it a decade later as much as a couple of her earlier ones have stuck with me.</p>
<p>That said, some of my favourite songs in it involve the theme of how dancing is wonderful, for instance:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For these I absolutely applaud her for defying the extremely upsetting &ldquo;research&rdquo; reported on by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/age-you-too-old-seen-2817000">Bristol Live</a> a few years ago whereby:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;37 is the age it becomes tragic to go to nightclubs, with 31 emerging as the age we officially prefer staying in to going out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This despite <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa022252">the fact</a> that dancing at the age of 75+ is in fact associated with a lower risk of dementia, amongst other health and wellbeing benefits.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658">The Signal and the Noise</a> by Nate Silver.</p>
<p>Nate Silver describes efforts to forecast events from a wide range of domains - everything from baseball to terrorism, from global warming to poker games. This includes a chapter on forecasting contagious diseases, some of which, despite being published in 2012, is probably all too familiar <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">in a world</a> where an otherwise  surprising number of people have unfortunately had to embed the concept of <a href="">R0</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451339/">case fatality rates</a> into their psyches.</p>
<p>In doing so he largely (very deliberately) shows the limits of our ability to accurately predict things. After all, it&rsquo;s not something humans have evolved to be good at. We&rsquo;re optimised for survival, not for being able to mathematically rigorously predict the future. And some things are inherently easier to predict than others. We&rsquo;re increasingly good at the short term weather forecast; we&rsquo;ve made <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/02/10/the-inherent-unpredictability.html">very little progress</a> when it comes to earthquakes.</p>
<p>Naively, one might think that because we have access to so much more information today than ever before - with each day increasing the store of data by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">historically unimaginable amounts</a> - that we should be in a great place to rapidly learn vastly more truth about the world than ever before.</p>
<p>But data isn&rsquo;t knowledge. The amount of total information is increasing far, far faster than the amount of currently <em>useful</em> information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re able to test so many hypotheses with so much data that even if we can avoid statistical issues such overfitting to the extent of being fairly good at knowing if a particular hypothesis is likely to be true or not, the fact that baseline rate of hypotheses being true is probably low means that we&rsquo;re constantly in danger of misleading ourselves into thinking we know something that we don&rsquo;t. This argument very much brings to mind the famous <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">&ldquo;Why Most Published Research Findings Are Wrong&rdquo; paper</a>.</p>
<p>As Silver writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think we want information when we really want knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, bad incentives exist in many forecast-adjacent domains today. Political pundits want to exude certainty, economists want to preserve their reputation, social media stars want to go viral, scientists want to get promoted. None of these are necessarily drivers that necessarily align with making accurate predictions. Some weather services are reticent to ever show a 50% chance of rain even if that&rsquo;s what the maths says; consumers see that as &ldquo;indecisive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Silver&rsquo;s take is that we can improve our ability to forecast events, and hence sometimes even save lives, by altering how we think about the world. We should take up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability">Bayesian</a> style of thinking. This approach lets us - in fact requires us - to quantify our pre-existing beliefs. We then constantly update them in a formalised way as and when new information becomes available to us, resulting in newly updated highly-quality beliefs of how likely something is to be true.</p>
<p>Our thinking should thus be probabilistic, not binary. It&rsquo;s very rare that something is 0% predictable or 100% predictable. We can usually say <em>something</em> about some aspect of any given future event. As such we should become comfortable with, and learn to express, uncertainty.</p>
<p>We should acknowledge our existing assumptions and beliefs. No-one starts off from a place of no bias and this will inevitably influence how you approach a given forecasting problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost a kind of Protestant work ethic about it that forecasters would be wise to adhere to:  work hard, be honest, be modest.</p>
<p>One can believe that an objective truth exists - in fact you sort of have to if you are trying to predict it - but we should be skeptical of any forecaster who believes they have certainty about it.</p>
<p>Borrowing from no less than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer">Serenity Prayer</a>, the author leaves us with the thought that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distinguishing the signal from the noise requires both scientific knowledge and self-knowledge: the serenity to accept the things we cannot predict, the courage to predict the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>🎙 Listened to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-chris-miller.html">The Most Amazing - and Dangerous - Technology in the World</a>&rdquo; from The Ezra Klein Show.</p>
<p>No, not AI, nuclear bombs or bioweapons, at least not directly. Here the discussion is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">semiconductors</a>, used to make computer chips.</p>
<p>Ezra talks to Chris Miller who has written about how chips &ldquo;created the modern world&rdquo;, infused as computer technology is into a vast array of domains of modern life. He&rsquo;s the author of the book &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781982172022?title=Chip+War&amp;author=Chris+Miller&amp;cover_id=78327">Chip War</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s probably the most mind blowing takeaway from it all is how fragile the chip manufacturing infrastructure is, particularly how few entities are capable of making especially the more advanced chips used in the modern world. If AI is indeed the huge deal many people believe it is then one can see that any vulnerabilities in the advanced chip supply chain may be extremely impactful.</p>
<p>A couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of the most advanced chips are produced by a single company, <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/">TSMC</a>. TSMC is a Taiwanese company, a country that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/taiwan-foreign-minister-warns-of-conflict-with-china-in-2027">not exactly</a> in the most reassuringly stable condition at the moment. The UK foreign secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/25/if-china-invaded-taiwan-it-would-destroy-world-trade-says-james-cleverly">recently warned</a> that should China invade Taiwan it would destroy world trade, let alone the ability to make advanced chips.</li>
<li>Every EUV lithography machine, essential to the manufacture of cutting-edge chips, is supplied by a single company - the Dutch firm <a href="https://www.asml.com/en">ASML</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chip manufacture is thus very vulnerable and also a tempting target for weaponisation. The podcast has examples of how the US and China combat each other along these lines.</p>

			 <p>The increase in the percentage of the US population who approve of the idea that people of different races should be able to marry freely is one of the largest changes in opinion that Gallup has seen <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354638/approval-interracial-marriage-new-high.aspx">in its polling</a> over the years.</p>
<p>From the 2021 survey, 94% approve of marriage between Black and White people, up from 4% (!) in 1961.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Predictably, most of this is driven by changes in White people&rsquo;s opinions, although there were previously substantial-but-smaller proportions of people in other groups who didn&rsquo;t approve of marrying across racial lines either.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to overlook how <em>some</em> things have changed substantially for the better, particularly whilst there remain so many things obviously wrong with the world of today. It somehow feels absolutely inconceivable that even within my own short lifetime there were extensive periods where the majority of Americans disapproved of people of differing races getting married.</p>
<p>That said, it was only last year that interracial and same-sex marriage rights were <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1112213293/house-vote-same-sex-marriage">codified into US federal law</a>, driven by the fear that the same kind of Supreme Court decision that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-oc">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a> might be weaponised against the kind of marriage rights that a certain type of conservative would rather didn&rsquo;t exist either in the future.</p>
<p>It was after all a Supreme Court decision that enabled the recognition of many American interracial marriages in the first place. Incredibly, it&rsquo;s only a little over 50 years since interracial marriages were literally illegal in many parts of the US. That changed in 1967, when in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia">Loving v. Virginia</a> the Supreme Court ruled that bans of that sort violated the constitution.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us">The Last Of Us</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not normally a big fan of zombie shows, but this one was getting such <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_last_of_us">exceptional reviews</a> I thought I should give it a go. I&rsquo;m glad to have done so.</p>
<p>The premise is that 20 years ago increasing global temperatures  led to some kind of parasitic fungus (&ldquo;Cordyceps&rdquo;) jumping species from insects to humans which results in them turning into something akin to the classic bite-others-to-infect-them zombie. The condition has thus spread far and wide and remains so far incurable, although there is technology to diagnose whether or not one is infected before symptoms appear. But it&rsquo;s not all about jump-scares and mowing down the undead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braindead_(film)">with lawnmowers</a>, there&rsquo;s a depth and occasional humour here, along side an exploration of much more human relationships, that makes it quite enthralling to watch.</p>
<p>An interesting dynamic occurs due to much of the show being set 20 years after the fungus began its ravages. Society has changed in many way of course, in some ways fairly predictably so. But additionally there&rsquo;s a generation of children and young adults that have never lived in any other world, and thus operate from very different reference points to our own.</p>
<p>The post-apocalyptic world is rendered very well in visual terms, with the impact of nature&rsquo;s re-taking over some of humanity&rsquo;s former accomplishments that society is no longer able to maintain very visible. The appearance of the zombies themselves I have to admit finding a little comical at times, although the way they move, jerky and fast, is certainly creepy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s based on a <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us">computer game</a>, but don&rsquo;t let historical precedent of game-to-show efforts put you off. It&rsquo;s now one I&rsquo;d love to play, it also being very much award-winning, although it looks like I&rsquo;d need to get a PlayStation to do so.</p>

And so AIsis' &ldquo;The Lost Tapes Volume One&rdquo; came to be.</p>
<p>Liam Gallagher is back fronting Oasis/AIsis with some classic sounding tunes, except of course it&rsquo;s not really Liam Gallagher. It&rsquo;s an AI.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From <a href="https://loudwire.com/ai-oasis-liam-gallagher-response-aisis-breezer-band/">Loudwire</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All I had to do was replace my vocals with Liam&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added. Geraghty spliced various a cappella recordings of Liam to train his AI version of the singer, then layered it overtop Breezer recordings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we go, Oasis kind-of reincarnated.</p>
<p>The reaction seems to be pretty positive in general. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/liamgallagher/status/1648540394639032320">Liam said</a> it was &ldquo;Mad as f**k I sound mega&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To be clear, the songs, music and lyrics were all written and performed by a human band in the first place, the afore-mentioned Breezer. The fact that it&rsquo;s fake-Liam that appears to be singing it is the only AI part. But it&rsquo;s fairly convincing to my ear. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before some band is revealed to entirely non-meat based.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability.ai</a> is the company behind AI text-to-image generator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>. This was the first widespread version of this technology that was both open source, meaning anyone who knows how to can modify it however they like, and optimised enough to be able to freely run entirely <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/830179/how-to-run-stable-diffusion-on-your-pc-to-generate-ai-images/">on your own computer</a>, a step that no doubt increased the popularity of this type of tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also available for use in the cloud if you prefer the simplicity of installing nothing.  There&rsquo;s a basic version available <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion">on HuggingFace</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;ve <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models">just released StableLM</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our StableLM models can generate text and code and will power a range of downstream applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is a similarly open-sourced AI large language model, akin to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> et al. Only in this case it&rsquo;s free for you <a href="https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM">to download</a> and/or adapt . Once again you can play with <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-chat">a cloud version</a> if you prefer.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s apparently a lot simpler and hence <a href="https://mashable.com/article/stablelm-stability-ai-language-model-explained">less &lsquo;accurate&rsquo;</a> than chatGPT itself. But as it&rsquo;s open source, anyone with the relevant knowledge is able to help diagnose and improve it. So quite possibly we&rsquo;ll see rapid increases in its ability over time - no doubt alongside more troubling adaptations, the world being what it is in 2023.</p>
<p>Stability.ai themselves plan to release more complex models soon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473597778">Unlawful Killings</a> by Her Honour Wendy Joseph KC.</p>
<p>Former Crown Court judge Wendy Joseph takes us through 5 fictional-but-based-on-reality trials of the type she presided over. The common theme is their relationship to a charge of murder.</p>
<p>The reader gets the intrigue associated with courtroom drama in general, alongside some more analytical legal tutoring as to how the court system works in practice, the factors that affect how cases are decided, what legislation applies and when. What does &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; mean? When is being sure required, vs on the balance of probabilities?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the case of the young man, a victim of knife crime, stabbed to death whilst on a lunch break. We see a mother who a witness believes was trying to suffocate her baby. Next up is another young man, who killed his friend in a car accident. Then the story of the parents whose child was found dead after a explosive family row. A solider appears to have killed his wife rather than let her leave him. And finally a wife who shot her allegedly career-criminal husband.</p>
<p>In each case we see that nothing is as simple as it sounds; very little is black or white. Often the people that kill are not inexplicably evil psychopaths who delight in pain, but people who have found themselves in extremely difficult situations, some of which may be unimaginable to a lot of us if we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Complications, both moral and legal ensue; mental illness, cultures of honour, infanticide, levels of diminished responsibility and gang life amongst others. We see witnesses who won&rsquo;t testify, experts who disagree with each other, and cases resting on the words of vulnerable young children. Occasionally there are tensions between the agreed procedures of law, the incentives for lawyers and  defendants, and what an external observer might consider as just. Nonetheless, the defendants are all alleged to have caused some of the greatest harms it is within our power to cause. At the end of the day it&rsquo;s for a random selection of us, the jury of their peers, to determine their guilt, and the judge to weigh in on the consequences.</p>
<p>In her telling of the stories we&rsquo;re introduced to the main characters present in each such trial: judge, defendant, solicitors, barristers, witnesses, clerks, ushers and the all-important jury. Appendices cover some of the relevant legislation and its interpretation. These days it seems judges may be quite constrained as to what they can do. Joseph appears to see her primary role as managing the proceedings of the trial, ensuring the rules are adhered to by all concerned, herself included.</p>
<p>One of her responsibilities is providing a &ldquo;path to verdict&rdquo;, translating the complexities of centuries of legal legislation to a set of decisions followable by a largely untrained jury as they make their determination, several of which are reproduced in this book.</p>
<p>The last chapter focuses on what Judge Joseph seems to see as a key failure of the system. Unlike the author of <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/04/16/the-arguments-for.html">the previous book I read</a> she&rsquo;s no prison abolitionist. But I understand that she would like to see far fewer cases brought to court, being on the same side as Mariame Kaba in terms of seeing it as very often a failure of society that something harmful enough to warrant a crown court case happened in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wrongdoers don&rsquo;t fall from the skies&hellip;they are formed not just by their capacities but by their experiences&hellip;particularly difficult experiences in childhood and adolescence. In some cases, if we are honest, we must accept we have allowed them to become what they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we create societies that alienate vast swathes of people, refuse to provide care to people - potential victims or perpetrators - at risk from mental illness, enable black market trades rife with violence whilst leaving large sections of the population destitute, vulnerable and unsatisfied, then we can&rsquo;t be surprised when sometimes bad things occur.</p>
<p>I think the author believes that we&rsquo;ve done a reasonable job of identifying what things should be classified as crime. But that we&rsquo;ve not done nearly enough in terms of preventing those things from occurring. More and more people are locked up in prison, their lives sometimes almost as ruined by the experience as those that they victimised. And yet, crime continues.</p>
<p>A key flaw she identifies in relying on the criminal justice system to manage crime is that, however progressive we make opportunities for restitution and rehabilitation, it doesn&rsquo;t kick in until after the harm has been done, after the crime has been committed.</p>
<p>Blaming crime on an individual being greedy, dishonest or angry may be satisfying. But many of us are also greedy, dishonest and angry but do not commit crime. She asks us to consider why this is.</p>
<p>Why when people are confronted with a situation wherein they could commit a crime do some choose to do so and others do not? How have we engineered a situation whereby someone feels that their best option for living the life they want is to knowingly harm another?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe, instead of clapping ourselves of the back for the excellence of our criminal justice system, we should accept that the commission of any crime is a mark that somewhere, somehow we have failed.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Last year an AI-generated picture <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/jason-allen-won.html">won an art competition</a>. The technology has of course only <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/21/ai-image-generator.html">got better</a> in the time since then. So inevitably an AI generated image has now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated">won a photography competition</a>, even though of course no photography was involved. Well, other than the no doubt huge number of photos the AI ingested as part of its training.</p>
<p>Photographer <a href="https://www.eldagsen.com/">Boris Eldagsen</a> won a prize at the <a href="https://www.worldphoto.org/sony-world-photography-awards">Sony World Photography Awards</a> with this entry:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>He titled it &ldquo;PSEUDOMNESIA | The Electrician&rdquo;, the first part of which is a reference to a condition associated with <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudomania+.">pathological lying</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Eldagsen is on board with the idea that AI generated images are not photography as such and hence is declining to actually take the award and associated prize. It seems he was more in it to generate some kind of discussion about how &ldquo;co-working&rdquo; with AI fits into the world of photography. After all, it&rsquo;s been a long time since the rules of many photography competitions forbade the use of computers and digital modification entirely. And as it stands, there&rsquo;s no reason to suppose that a more nefarious actor couldn&rsquo;t win a competition with the help of AI image generation in the future without feeling inclined to reveal the true source of their image.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/death-in-paradise/seasons/12">season 12 of Death in Paradise</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s favourite vacation paradise / murder hotspot returns for more light-hearted death presented in a Agatha Christie-ish style except with a backing track of jolly Caribbean tunes and occasional slapstick chases.</p>
<p>So the same as it&rsquo;s always been. It&rsquo;s never been the most fashionable of shows, but it has been one of the most consistent and, perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/13/mystery-how-death-in-paradise-quietly-became-one-of-tvs-biggest-hits">most popular</a> BBC shows of the past decade.</p>
<p>Really the worst I can say about it is its slight whiff of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film">White savior trope</a> in a &lsquo;clever and logical white man comes to solve foreign mysteries&rsquo; way. Although the gentleman in question changes every so often and is always a little weird or inadequate in stereotypically British other ways. But if you liked anything in the last huge number of series then there&rsquo;s no reason not to watch this one. I found a couple of the later episodes actually fairly gripping.</p>
<p>Very much &lsquo;familiar, warm and dependable&rsquo;, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/07/death-in-paradise-review-its-no-luther-and-thank-heavens-for-that">the Guardian</a> says.

			 <p>Rome et al analyse <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2792986">the costs of newly-launched pharmaceuticals in the US</a>. They discover that the median average launch price of a drug has increased from just over $2,000 per year in 2018 up to $180,000 in 2021. Almost half of drugs launched in 2020-2021 cost over $150,000 a year.</p>
<p>The mean average price increased exponentially during this period by around 20% per year. Some of this may be explained by differences in the characteristics of the drugs launched in each year; oncology drugs and those for rare diseases tend to be more expensive. But even with that taken into account as best as the researchers could do, there remained an exponential increase in annual cost of around 13% per year.</p>
<p>This is clearly unsustainable for anyone who is in the position of actually having to pay for these treatments. The researchers suggest that in line with some other similar countries &ldquo;the US could stop allowing drug manufacturers to freely set prices&rdquo;, which would seem to me to be an obvious and decent first step.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781642595260">We Do This &lsquo;Til We Free Us</a> by Mariame Kaba.</p>
<p>In this book, Mariame Kaba presents a collection of short and readable articles - reprints of magazine or interviews for example - all dedicated to educating about and encouraging readers to take actions towards the total abolition of the prison system, and policing too. &ldquo;Defund the police&rdquo; taken to its most literal conclusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a position I started off with some sympathy towards. I am more than happy to accept that far more people are in prison than should be. This book focuses on the US system, and that is almost indisputably true there.</p>
<p>I was already happy with the idea that the focus of the criminal justice system (or criminal punishment system, as she calls it - feeling there&rsquo;s very little justice to be had in it today) should be on issues such as safety and restitution rather than punishment for punishment&rsquo;s sake. Prison should be a last resort after all other options have been explored. There&rsquo;s a lot of reform to what prison entails, and the life of someone post-prison, that should be urgently made. Likewise policing - again, a last resort, after other arms of the state whose role is to assist people in need have done all they can.</p>
<p>As far as I can see there is substantial evidence that much &ldquo;crime&rdquo; is driven by structural societal factors which opens many avenues for mass-scale prevention that could be invested to avoid incidents where people are even tempted to call the police occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never quite been able to push myself to the full abolitionist perspective that prison and policing are entirely unnecessary. Kaba would probably consider that a lack of imagination, which I&rsquo;m happy to acknowledge. And so this book tries to provide the impetus for a full abolitionist outcome.</p>
<p>There are many aspects to this. Below is my attempt to summarise some of her main points.</p>
<h3 id="the-philosophical-argument">The philosophical argument</h3>
<p>Philosophically, the author entirely agrees that there should be consequences when people cause harm. However there is a difference between &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; that aim to help victims and make society at large and &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; that aims in part to make a perpetrator suffer. Sometimes they may look similar, but their goal is different and the latter is inhumane, however attractive it may be to those affected.</p>
<p>But the priority should be addressing the conditions that allowed the harm to take place and the actual needs of the person to whom it was done to. The default of people locking people in cages away from our sight-line is an abdication of the responsibility we all have to help those harmed. It hides important social and political failures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the system does nothing to encourage accountability. In fact it works against it. People cannot be forced to accept accountability. The current adversarial court system discourages people from taking personal and public responsibility for their actions because it&rsquo;s almost always in the perpetrator&rsquo;s interest to deny or minimise the harm the caused, even when they&rsquo;re fully aware and may like to make some kind of restitution. But if a guilty plea would result in inevitable imprisonment then they may find this unpalatable.</p>
<p>Many &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; are in fact victims of something themselves; the victim / perpetrator binary is a fiction. Most women in US prisons are poor, of colour and have experienced physical violence from a partner. Without lessening any harm they commit, we can acknowledge that some criminal actions come from someone making choices that they should never have been put in the position of making.</p>
<p>Hurt people hurt people; desperate people hurt people. Lessening social and economic inequities, and making other, non-criminalising, services easily available could go a long way to preventing the harm in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neutralizing perceived threats, in an endless game of legal whack-a-mole, is not a path to safety. To create safer environments, people and circumstances must be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-legitimacy-argument">The legitimacy argument.</h3>
<p>Firstly we should examine the definition of crime. It&rsquo;s often arbitrary. Not everything that is criminalised is harmful. Not all harm is criminalised. A classic example of the latter is CEOs of companies who cause deaths by e.g. harmful, yet perfectly legal, environmental practices.</p>
<p>Additionally, prejudice is rife within the US criminal justice system, notably in the conflation of Blackness with criminality. Black people are more likely to be arrested and more likely to get harsh sentences than white people for the same offence. Black victims of crime are more likely to be ignored.</p>
<p>The current system doesn&rsquo;t truly even try to meet the needs of victims. Services like counselling, healthcare, housing or money are rarely on offer.</p>
<p>Even in the domain of punishment the victim rarely has the final word. If the system requires the perpetrator to be be jailed then the are, irrespective of the victim&rsquo;s wishes.  The extreme case is someone being sentenced to death (remembering this book is mostly about the US) when the victim is virulent anti the death penalty. They may even feel like they have another person&rsquo;s death of their conscience unless they drop the charges.</p>
<p>The rise of the &ldquo;prison industrial complex&rdquo; has produced economic incentives such for the  system to perpetuate itself it needs to increase the number people imprisoned and the duration of their sentences.</p>
<p>Our response to violence and harm should not cause more violence and harm</p>
<h3 id="the-efficacy-argument">The efficacy argument</h3>
<p>Kaba writes a lot about sexual abuse. This is a crime so pervasive and in some cases so horrific that being seen to argue against an offender going to prison is almost blasphemous even in - or perhaps especially in - liberal circles.</p>
<p>But she raises fair points in that its very pervasiveness shows that the current system doesn&rsquo;t work Very few reported cases in any case get anywhere near court. Those that do often in reality lead the victim being put on trial more than the perpetrator. These and other factors means who suffer this harm rarely even report it, demonstrating a total lack of faith in the only system that today exists to supposedly help victims of harm.</p>
<p>Harm caused by police officers - sexual misconduct is the second most common form of police violence - is very rarely punished.</p>
<p>The public does not understand the practicalities of policing. Most US officers make just a 1 felony arrest a year. Most of their time is spent dealing with non-criminal issues such as traffic citation, noise complaints or wellness checks. Many of these would be better done by non-police personnel who have better training in for example mental health issues.</p>
<p>In general, there is little-to-no evidence that prisons reduce violence, crime or people&rsquo;s fear of it. The US prison population increased by over 400% between 1979 and 2014. Neither crime or the fear of crime is 400% lower now.</p>
<p>Some research suggests that going to prison <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/rethinking-prison-deterrent-future-crime">increases the likelihood</a> that you will commit crime again in the future. It&rsquo;s not clear that they&rsquo;re even a deterrent in the first place - criminals do not tend to be dispassionately weighing up potential risks and rewards before making their choices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a system that never addresses the why behind a harm never actually contains the harm itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reform-is-not-enough">Reform is not enough</h2>
<p>The author believes that reforming the system will never be enough, and may often be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Previous reforms that may have been well-intentioned with regards to reducing the inhumanity of the prison industrial complex system tend to result in little more than more people being criminalised. A historical example is the introduction of women-only prisons and its relationship towards a far greater number of women being imprisoned.</p>
<p>The only reforms she believes we should support are those that reduce the amount of contact the public has with the police and reduce the resources the police have access to. These are steps on the way to full abolition that immediately reduce the harm police can do to people.</p>
<p>She believes that what we need beyond anything is imagination. Her view is that it&rsquo;s perfectly fine, even necessary, to criticise the system even if we don&rsquo;t have a fully fleshed out view of an alternative. Measures can be taken now to address issues that we do have solutions for, and real collective effort should be made to figure out the best way forward on those that we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In the mean time, our lack of imagination has several adverse effects. We imagine that policing, prisons and surveillance are &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. This is not true. Prisons are a human invention; in fact a fairly recent one if we consider the current incarnation whose aim is to punish people who committed serious offences by locking them up for long periods of time. These first appeared <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2022/prison-history-ashley-rubin-qa">in the late 18th century</a>; themselves a reform from the previous punishment regime of capital and corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Our criminal punishment system is also contingent on our culture. We tend to believe that our culture is static, even though it never has been. The fear we&rsquo;re taught to have for each other, the need to bow to authority and celebrate criminalisation of harm-doers is not the only option.</p>
<p>When asked to imagine a world without prisons we tend to imagine the world exactly as today, with the same level of violence, but without prisons.  Instead the aim should be  to create a different type of society built on cooperation and mutual aid rather than individualism and self-preservation.</p>

			 <p>Euronews.next <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-">reports on a tragic case</a> where a man killed himself, his suicidal thoughts allegedly exacerbated by his interaction with an AI chatbot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a series of consecutive events, Eliza not only failed to dissuade Pierre from committing suicide but encouraged him to act on his suicidal thoughts to “join” her so they could “live together, as one person, in paradise”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bot in question was based on  <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/releases">EleutherAI’s GPT-J</a>, and uses the same kind of technology as chatGPT et al, seemingly without the same guardrails that the more famous ones implement. He was interacting with the AI via the <a href="https://www.chai-research.com/get_chai.html">Chai app</a>, which offers a varied selection of AI &lsquo;personalities&rsquo; to chat with - marketed at least on the Android store as &ldquo;chat with AI friends&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s little doubt that the man in question had a troubled mental state before talking to the bot, and I’m not aware that any formal investigation has quantified any effect that the AI may have had in this case, it does feel like there&rsquo;s a potentially real issue to consider here.</p>
<p>We tend to accept that suicidal tendencies can sometimes be reduced via chatting, at least to real humans trained to help in these situations from services like the <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/">Samaritans</a>.  In the US, the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline explicitly offers <a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat/">a chat feature</a>, again, importantly, humans only. And, although I&rsquo;ve not looked into the research at all, the opposite also appears to be considered to be true in the human world; <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2015/02/28/teen-arrested-for-encouraging-suicide">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.whby.com/2021/10/19/woman-sentenced-to-jail-for-encouraging-father-to-commit-suicide/">people</a> have been found criminally responsible for encouraging others to kill themselves.</p>
<p>The app in question of course wasn&rsquo;t designed to encourage these actions, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve any reason to believe  that the default behaviour of large language models is to do the opposite either.</p>

			 <p>With their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/apr/07/labour-defends-ad-claiming-sunak-doesnt-think-child-sex-abusers-should-be-jailed">new advert</a>, the Labour Party have managed to do the unthinkable and almost make me feel sorry for Rishi Sunak.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For one, I doubt anyone involved in its creation - or almost anyone else for that matter - believes the claim that Sunak thinks people that abuse children shouldn&rsquo;t go to jail. Given the rightful backlash in times past when members of Sunak&rsquo;s party, mostly notably Boris Johnson, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60213975">unfairly and offensively</a> accusing Keir Starmer of being soft on child abusers one would think they should know better.</p>
<p>It is absolutely fair to publicise and campaign on the fact that much crime in the UK is effectively legal at present given the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/08/09/less-than-of.html">horrendously low rates</a> at which crime is solved.  Undoubtedly a huge part of that is the mismanagement and underfunding of both the police and other public sector bodies that may have been in a position to prevent a certain amount of crime taking place in the first place that the Conservative government has subjected us to over the last decade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right for Sunak and his colleagues to be held accountable for that and the other ways that they have damaged British society.  But personal and almost certainly untrue adverts like this are not the way to go about leveraging that, even if you believe more incarceration is a valid goal. I&rsquo;m curious how well the advert even polls with people, not that that should be the sole deciding factor as to whether one releases such material.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>🎥 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-batman-2022">The Batman</a>.</p>
<p>Despite fairly glowing <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_batman">reviews</a> I found this a little disappointing, with the exception of the visual rendering of Gotham City which was a treat for my eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m being a little unfair. I absolutely loved the previous film in that world, <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/joker-2019">Joker</a>. So this had a lot to live up to.  It also takes a lot for me to enjoy a 3-hour-long film. Especially when at times the reason it needed to be that long seemed to be that the hero speaks. extremely. slowly.</p>
<p>There were moments that got very close to interesting. Without giving spoilers, there was a little meander into Batman&rsquo;s family history which could have led to  a fascinating exploration of the tension between his singular focus on catching individual criminal masterminds vs the Wayne family&rsquo;s historical and current potential culpability in creating or reinforcing the structural conditions of the society within which the residents of the imperilled Gotham City exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a pretty place. Inequality seems rife. Violence is infused. Healthcare seems minimal. The arms of the state are corrupt. It is explicitly noted that there&rsquo;s a vast difference even in what it means to be an orphan based on the wealth one happens to have access to. And the Wayne family, past and present, seem to be powerfully connected billionaires. It&rsquo;s not clear that punching bad men in the face is the only or optimal approach to reducing the harm the residents of Gotham city experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone somewhere has written an essay on that because whilst the film almost seemed like it was going to centre that uneasiness for a few moments it didn&rsquo;t really follow through. I think it was an fine enough film, worth a watch if you&rsquo;re a Batman film, but kind of forgettable in a way that I didn&rsquo;t think the Joker was.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/04/11/britons-rejoice-the.html">Britons rejoice: The official King Charles coronation emoji is here</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Only about a month to go until King Charles' coronation, and finally Buckingham Palace have released what we&rsquo;ve all been anxiously quoting for: the <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily/status/1645177532235251712?s=20">official emoji</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s a depiction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown">St. Edward&rsquo;s Crown</a>.  The crown dates from around 1661 - version 2 at least; the original was lost or destroyed around 1649 as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">civil war</a>.</p>
<p>But since George V&rsquo;s coronation in 1911 this crown has played a part in every such occasion; almost 5 solid lbs of gold and gems perched on the head of each new ruler.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/official-coronation-emoji-revealed-buckingham-palace-confirms-social-media-design-for-kings-crowning-12853703">Sky News</a> is on top of things, helpfully informing us that &lsquo;An emoji has never been created for a British coronation before&rsquo;. This may not be the most 🤯 fun fact in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">our previous ruler</a> was famously long reigning, having been crowned in 1953 - before even the <em>first</em> iPhone was released if you can imagine such a thing.</p>
<p>In case that&rsquo;s not enough to quell your posting desire, some &lsquo;official&rsquo; hashtags have also been &lsquo;released&rsquo;. Very 2020. You&rsquo;ve five to choose from, only two of which are a bit odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>#Coronation</li>
<li>#CoronationConcert</li>
<li>#CoronationWeekend</li>
<li>#CoronationBigLunch</li>
<li>#TheBigHelpOut</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the coronation emoji hasn&rsquo;t been authorised by the <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/about-emoji/">Unicode Consortium</a> so it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ll actually be able to use it in the conventional manner. Mostly we&rsquo;ll have to make do with the existing 👑.</p>
<p>But lest you think The Palace is pure bandwagonning it by calling their perfectly normal picture an emoji, there is one exception of with the once-semi reputable social network known as Twitter. If you use the state authorised hashtags within your 🔥 take coronation tweets then your post will be &lsquo;rewarded&rsquo; with the new emoji (unless Elon Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/21/elon-musk-went-on-a-firing-frenzy-at-twitter-now-hes-paying-for-it">fires</a> the emoji engineer in the mean time).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/04/09/donald-trump-as.html">Donald Trump as Easter Jesus: the latest unhinged metaphor</a></h1>

			 <p>Happy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter">Easter</a> to all those who celebrate it. This is the day where religious Christians celebrate the resurrection of the saviour of the world, after he&rsquo;d suffered a particularly cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of his persecutors who hated him solely for political reasons. And a lot of other people who want to mark the occasion eat chocolate eggs.</p>
<p>Traditionally of course Christians take Jesus as being the saviour in question. However the less normal side of the often-Christian US Republican movement has decided that this year we should take someone else as being the 2023 instantiation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-arraignment-jesus-christ-conspiracy-theory-670c45bd71b3466dcd6e8e188badcd1d">AP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons likening Trump to Christ were among the top online narratives about the Republican former president and his criminal charges circulating in the last several days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, inevitably, the wilder fringe believes that Donald Trump is in fact the 2023 incarnation of Jesus. This is based on the fact that he became <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/31/donald-trump-becomes.html">the first US president ever to be charged with a crime</a> last week, charged with 34 felony offences, mainly around conducting illegal financial shenanigans in order to try and hide some of his affairs and potentially secret children. Not something that I ever heard that the original Jesus was supposed to have done, but there we go.</p>
<p>Extra fuel was put on the fire of this rancid discourse by one of the movement&rsquo;s favourite US politicians, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, whose Twitter bio starts with the word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; and yet still had this to say in a televised interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus was arrested and murdered by the Roman government. There have been many people throughout history that have been arrested and persecuted by radical corrupt governments, and it’s beginning today in New York City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McBride, a lawyer famed for representing folk who took part in the January 6th insurrection <a href="https://twitter.com/McBrideLawNYC/status/1637080811768885248">joined the chorus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Christ was crucified, and then rose again on the 3rd day, so too will Donald Trump</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I think we&rsquo;ve all had enough of Trump rising, especially poor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels">Stormy Daniels</a>. However, he never ever has had enough of talking so was more than happy to frame his arrest, which all started with him participating in various activities very much banned by the bible, as being an instance of religious persecution against Christians.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/right-wing-faith-leaders-trump-indicted-for-your-sins-1234710273/">Rolling Stone</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But then Trump switched gears, painting his legal woes in a frame of religious persecution. He argued that believers in “our beautiful Christianity” have been targeted: “We’re being discriminated against as a religion. We’re being discriminated against as a faith,” he insisted. “And we can’t let that continue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course many actual Christians are fairly disgusted at the idea that this breaker of a good number of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">ten commandments</a> is in fact an echo of God&rsquo;s only begotten son. Some see it as American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism">Christian nationalism</a> taking many steps too far: &ldquo;the heretical merging of American and far-right Christian identities to proclaim that only conservative Christians count as true Americans”, to quote the <a href="https://time.com/6269313/trump-jesus-comparisons-blasphemy/">Reverend Nathan Empsall</a> who understandably finds the Trump = Jesus take rather blasphemic.</p>
<p>The Reverend does see one parallel in the Jesus/Trump narrative, but one where Trump is cast into the part of a different actor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pontius Pilate, on the other hand, was a regional Roman dictator known not only for his cruelty, but also for his alliance with local religious leaders. The high priests were eager to collude with the governor, including to crucify Jesus, because it allowed them to keep their status and personal freedom.

			 <p>A few years ago, a group of researchers spent their time looking for the world&rsquo;s oldest recorded-in-writing joke.</p>
<p>The oldest they found was from Sumeria in around 1900 BC. Prepare yourself for some 2000+ year old mirth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something which has never occurred since time immemorial&hellip;A young woman did not fart in her husband&rsquo;s lap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remaining oldest nine are available in the <a href="https://www.insider.com/historians-10-oldest-jokes-in-history-1900bc-2019-7">same Insider article</a> that the above retelling of the world&rsquo;s earliest known fart joke is from.</p>
<p>More locally to me, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-joke-odd/worlds-oldest-joke-traced-back-to-1900-bc-idUSKUA14785120080731">Reuters reports</a> that the earliest recorded British joke was some Angle-Saxon innuendo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What hangs at a man’s thigh and wants to poke the hole that it’s often poked before? 
Answer: A key.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t the worst joke I&rsquo;ve heard even in modern times, if only we still hung keys at our thighs.</p>

<p>Using Mendelian randomization they found evidence for a causal relationship between hyper-palatable foods and the rising risk of obesity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, whilst I grudgingly understand that this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">April Fool&rsquo;s joke</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the conclusion is wrong!</p>
<p>A recent episode of the Ezra Klein Show, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-stephen-guyenet.html">Our Brains Weren&rsquo;t Designed for This Kind of Food</a>&rdquo; interviewed  Stephan Guyenet who argued that the huge rise in rates of obesity in recent times is not a product of everyone suddenly magically losing all reason and will-power overnight and making &ldquo;bad&rdquo; individual choices. This of course should not come as a surprise to anyone who has read anything reputable over the past few decades on the subject (or simply engaged their common sense).</p>
<p>He argues that instead the main driver is that we&rsquo;ve created ourselves a food environment to live within which is entirely strange and unsuited to the way our brains and genetics have come to work through evolutionary history.</p>
<p>When someone told me about the existence of <a href="https://tastewise.io/blog/introducing-TasteGPT">tasteGPT </a>- a LLM AI that sucks up a pile of data and then informs food companies what sorts of foods they should make and market for maximum sales potential via a chatbot - I felt a sense of trepidation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely a world wherein I could get onboard with fake <a href="https://conscienhealth.org/2023/04/the-imperative-to-make-food-unpleasant/">Agatha Hannigan&rsquo;s comment</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, food marketers have come up with an endless array industrially formulated foods that taste unnaturally good. This is terrible.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/30/public-support-for.html">Public support for strikes remains high, despite what it looks like on social media</a></h1>

			 <p>The UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/05/an-understandable-epidemic.html">cavalcade of strike action</a> that has been taking place over the past few months continues in earnest. The <a href="https://www.strikecalendar.co.uk/">UK Strike Action Calendar</a> shows who&rsquo;s on strike on any given day, and it&rsquo;s often multiple groups.</p>
<p>Although I have limited exposure myself, I&rsquo;m told that if you open Facebook or its ilk whenever you open it you mostly see a deluge of &ldquo;strikers are bad and lazy and overpaid i hate them sack them all&rdquo; comments. This is hurtful to those who find it necessary to take action. Trying to organise in what appears to be an environment where nobody supports you is surely disheartening and disempowering.</p>
<p>But as far as I can tell this condemning of strike action reflects the usual social media algorithmic insistence on promoting outrage content - nothing raises engagement stats more than an argument - more than a true reflection of public opinion. The British public in general remain more supportive than opposed to strike action, even in an environment where much mainstream media isn&rsquo;t adverse to <a href="https://socialistworker.co.uk/comment/how-effective-are-the-medias-attacks-on-strikes/">joining in with the insults and doom-mongering</a>.</p>
<p>Taking the ongoing teachers' strikes as an example, my understanding is that there&rsquo;s even a set of trolls that go to the bother of infiltrating private teacher Facebook groups just to spout abuse at a group of truly essential workers in a field that has a tremendous <a href="https://www.tes.com/magazine/analysis/general/teacher-recruitment-crisis-teacher-training-itt-teacher-pay">recruitment and retainment crisis</a> but nonetheless have been subject to a substantial and ongoing <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/what-has-happened-teacher-pay-england">real terms pay cut</a> over the last decade, not to mention the increasingly dire working conditions that harm both school staff and students. &lsquo;Teachers&rsquo; working conditions are students' learning conditions' to quote Mariame Kaba in her pro-abolition book, &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781642595260">We do this &lsquo;til we free us</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anyway, the latest representative public opinion stats I could quickly find are from <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/6-10-parents-support-teachers-going-strike-1-5-oppose">an Ipsos poll</a>. from early March. In that, 48% of Britons supported teacher strike action, with 29% actively opposed.</p>
<p>Explicit support was even higher in the people who one might think have the most stake when it comes to the impact of the strike - but who also possibly  in many cases may have more of a sense of the current state of the system than many of the rest of us: parents. 60% of parents and guardians support teacher strike action, with only 20% being opposed.</p>
<p>Sure, many of them are concerned about the impact of strikes on their child&rsquo;s education (~40% of all parents/guardians). Given one of the points here is that plentiful and well-resourced teachers are necessary for a good education to be delivered it&rsquo;s actually surprising to me that that figure is not higher. But it seems like they&rsquo;re correctly taking a longer, more structural, view.  They have a substantially higher level of concern present about the fact that education is suffering due to a lack of investment in schools and teachers (60%). Of course this concern of the majority is exactly what a lot of these strikes are about.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth the same polls showed the British public to be net in support of strikes by nurses, ambulance workers, railway workers, border fore staff, civil servants and university support.  From the polled options, only strikes by driving instructors were more opposed (35%) than supported (28%).</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780429639142">Statistical Rethinking</a> by Richard McElreath.</p>
<p>This textbook that teaches the use of Bayesian techniques and casual inference approaches (directed acyclic graphs and the like) as a way to test and compare scientific, as opposed to purely statistical, theories. There&rsquo;s chapters on important topics that other approaches often ignore such as measurement error.</p>
<p>Honestly it felt like hard going at times, particularly as I was reading it as context for an <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/12/a-few-of.html">associated course</a> that the author was kindly providing, meaning that there were deadlines. But it did open up an interesting range of new possibilities that I&rsquo;m looking forward to integrating in my future work, as well as new ways of thinking about modelling, so hopefully very worthwhile!</p>
<p>The code examples in the book mostly use an accompanying R library, <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/">rethinking</a>, along with base R techniques. Although people have rewritten the examples to use e.g. tidyverse and brm, or Python, Julia and possibly others - links to those can be seen on the <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">author&rsquo;s book page</a>.</p>

			 <p>I recently got access to <a href="https://bard.google.com/">Bard</a>, Google&rsquo;s chatGPT-esque language language model chatbot.</p>
<p>Curious about whether these systems have guardrails for or against dissing each other, I asked it whether it was better than <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a>. It was kind of modest, but clearly thinks itself the better bot.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: It is difficult to say definitively whether I am better than ChatGPT, as we both have different strengths and weaknesses. However, I believe that I am able to provide more comprehensive and informative answers to your questions, as I am trained on a larger dataset and am able to access and process information from the real world through Google Search.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability to live-access information would seem to give it a potential edge, for better or worse. ChatGPT deliberately cannot do this. So I asked for Bard&rsquo;s summary of today&rsquo;s UK news.</p>
<p>Here we go, at least the first part:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Bard</strong>: Here are some of the top news stories from the UK today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing calls to resign after a report found that he and other senior government officials held parties during the COVID-19 pandemic, in violation of lockdown rules.</li>
<li>The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates for the fourth time in a row in an effort to combat rising inflation.</li>
<li>The UK government is facing criticism for its handling of the refugee crisis from Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This seems to me to be a good example of my favourite generative AI terminological construct: <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/07/stackoverflow-bans-fluent.html">fluent bullshit</a>.   Thematically it&rsquo;s not bad in terms of the recent state of the country. Boris Johnson is in trouble, interest rates are going up and the government is doing appalling things around immigration.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely not what I think the average person would think of as today&rsquo;s news. None of this was headlining the papers at the time, or near the top of <a href="https://news.google.com/foryou">Google&rsquo;s own news product</a>. It all kind of feels like last month&rsquo;s headlines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also factually incorrect in terms of the details. Far from considering the fourth consecutive interest rate rise, the Bank of England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/23/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-inflation">enacted its eleventh one</a> last week.</p>
<p>ChatGPT knows it&rsquo;s own limits here, demurring from answering directly and suggesting I go check the website of one of a few news sites, specifically the BBC or some of the more serious UK newspapers.</p>

			 <p>📺 Finished watching seasons 1-4 of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/145905">Ghosts</a>.</p>
<p>Funny, harmless, British sitcom wherein Alison and Mike inherit a haunted mansion. Given ghosts are generally invisible and immaterial, the lucky couple would probably never have known about them, except that after Alison sustains a head injury she develops the ability to see and hear them.</p>
<p>As far as Mike is concerned then, Alison is constantly distracted, talking to nobody. Whilst she is endlessly surrounded by shouty demanding ex-people desperate for company. But they seem to be able to work that out just fine.</p>
<p>The ghosts are of people who died in the area of the house throughout history, from caveman to sleazy very obviously Thatcherite Conservative MP. Although the latter&rsquo;s manner of speech often calls Blair to my mind.</p>
<p>The ghosts are stuck on the premises, with only each other to talk to - endless games of charades ensue - until such time as they are inexplicably &lsquo;sucked off&rsquo; to another realm. Their words, not mine. This is classic British humour see. One of them is, inevitably, called Fanny.</p>
<p>Recommended. Although I still haven&rsquo;t figured out how I&rsquo;d cope with either being Alison or a ghost.</p>

			 <p>An open-source alternative using a similar kind of large language model technology as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT</a> does is <a href="https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit">now available</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit">Together</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s thus entirely customisable by anyone who knows what they&rsquo;re doing. Which isn&rsquo;t a tiny barrier - it&rsquo;s not like some app you can just download to your computer and double-click on.  But it opens up development and contribution up to a wide range of people who otherwise might not have access to this technology, as well as innate transparency as to how the model works and what data it&rsquo;s using.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day OpenChatKit will be to chatGPT as <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stable Diffusion</a> is to <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>. In the mean time, you can play with it via the web and give feedback to the developers <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit">here</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly not as comprehensive as chatGPT as by default, but, who knows, one day it might get there if it takes off enough such that people who have the relevant data or expertise contribute.</p>
<p>It also has a fine-tuning mechanism such that you can create chatbots for specific applications. Examples they&rsquo;ve worked on include a chatbot to help students learn from the contents of textbooks or one trained on financial data that can answer questions about finance.</p>
<p>This happened on roughly the same week that the creators of the actual chatGPT, <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, move ever further in the direction of ignoring their company&rsquo;s name and what appeared to be their original mission in order to take a much more closed and secretive approach when it comes to sharing the details of their GPT-4 software.</p>
<p>One of the founders, research director Ilya Sutskever, gives the reason for this decision as being something to the effect of AI being just too powerful and scary for the hoi polloi to have access to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview">The Verge</a> quotes Sutskever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flat out, we were wrong. If you believe, as we do, that at some point, AI -AGI - is going to be extremely, unbelievably potent, then it just does not make sense to open-source. It is a bad idea&hellip; I fully expect that in a few years it’s going to be completely obvious to everyone that open-sourcing AI is just not wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a controversial opinion to some. And possibly the idea of this being the sole motivator is confounded by other changes in the direction of their organisation.  Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">GPT-4 technical report</a> also mentions &ldquo;the competitive landscape&rdquo; as one reason why they are not sharing many details.</p>
<p>In any case, whilst it&rsquo;s easy to see the intuition behind that kind of argument (if you are happy to accept OpenAI and their rivals as being 100% trustworthy caretakers of AI use and policy for the good of all in society) I can&rsquo;t really imagine that &ldquo;not telling us how your powerful technology works&rdquo; is the best method of saving humanity from itself in the long term.</p>
<p>Or even possibly all that effective on its own terms. After all, the source code for the Facebook equivalent <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/11/last-month-facebook.html">was leaked</a> within a couple of weeks of its release.</p>

			 <p>There was a moment where <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> was accidentally <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/openai-shut-down-chatgpt-to-fix-bug-exposing-user-chat-titles">leaking the title of people&rsquo;s chats to other users</a>. Only the title, not the full conversation in this case, but it&rsquo;s perhaps only a matter of time before someone&rsquo;s bot is hacked or malfunctions enough to share more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary thought when already some people are effectively <a href="https://mashable.com/article/how-to-chat-with-chatgpt-mental-health-therapy">using them as therapists</a>. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the more human-like style of conversation they produce and the &lsquo;texting a friend&rsquo; like interface that many of them have  is conducive to users sharing a whole lot more personal information than they typically would with other online services.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/23/the-th-anniversary.html">The 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/23/the-th-anniversary.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-23 10:59:28 &#43;0100">Mar 23, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s just been the 20-year anniversary of one of the more formative-to-me and likely damaging-to-the-world political episodes I can remember from my youth: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. This was spearheaded by US president George Bush, with the UK&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, often portrayed as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm">Bush&rsquo;s poodle</a>  (a take that I now know is unfair to actual poodles), joining in amongst others.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64976144">the BBC summarises</a>, it did not go well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that Saddam Hussein was appalling. Truly horrific. Famously, decades ago he&rsquo;d even used chemical weapons to commit atrocities <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/iraq_events/html/chemical_warfare.stm">against his own citizens</a>. There&rsquo;s no serious doubt that his removal should in theory have been a very good thing.  But as to who should remove him, how, for what reason and, all-importantly, what should happen afterwards are all issues where, let&rsquo;s say, suboptimal decisions were taken.</p>
<p>The motivation given to us, citizens of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_the_willing_(Iraq_war)">the coalition of the willing</a>&rdquo;, was something mainly along the lines of &ldquo;Saddam Hussein is behind al-Qaeda&rsquo;s acts of terrorism&rdquo; and &ldquo;he has illegal weapons of mass destruction that can be deployed in the next 45 minutes&rdquo;. Those sentiments were widely contested at the time and sure enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam%E2%80%93al-Qaeda_conspiracy_theory">turned out</a> to be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-45minute-claim-was-false-535224.html">untrue</a>.</p>
<p>The UN process was overlooked, to the extent that most likely the US-led invasion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq">was illegal</a>. It certainly caused tension with some NATO allies who declined to join in. There were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/15/politics.politicalnews">huge protests against the invasion in the UK</a>, but our government decided to go ahead anyway. Global institutions such as the UN were weakened, potentially leading to some of the poor responses the rest of the world has made to other such geopolitical crises since then.</p>
<p>Saddam was removed from power relatively quickly, but what transpired next was something like an insurgency against a US-ordained occupation. As time went on, a lack of effective government exacerbated the eruption of essentially a civil war between the main ethnic or religious groups in Iraq, with Jihadists groups joining in. The extraordinarily violent extremist group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State">ISIS </a>- the &ldquo;Islamic State of Iraq and Syria&rdquo; - thrived.</p>
<p>All in all, the abject failure of the approach that the US and its allies took left the world a worse and more dangerous place. The post-invasion conditions in Iraq itself got so bad that some Iraqi&rsquo;s reportedly consider the days when they were under Saddam&rsquo;s tyranny as better than what came next.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64976144">BBC article:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a sign of how bad the past 20 years have been that Saddam nostalgia is well established in Iraq, not just among his own Sunni community. People complain that at least you knew where you were with the old dictator. He was an equal opportunities killer of anyone he saw as an enemy, including his own son-in-law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course all the people Saddam killed are unable to express an opinion. But neither are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War#Tables">hundreds of thousands of Iraqis</a> who died as a result of the invasion, and potentially some of the uncountable number of people who would go on to be negatively affected as part of the downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Trying to quantify a small part of that also resulted in one of the most haunting and memorable graphs I can recall ever seeing; <a href="http://www.simonscarr.com/iraqs-bloody-toll">Simon Scarr&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/infographics/article/1284683/iraqs-bloody-toll">Iraq&rsquo;s Bloody Toll</a>&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html">release of GPT-4</a> has led to a flurry of mind-bendingly impressive tricks that I mean to create a list of. Unfortunately it also enables grim but inevitable services such as <a href="https://cupidbot.ai/">CupidBot</a>.</p>
<p>This abuse of cutting-edge AI software allows men - yes, only men, heterosexual men at that - to have a bot log onto their various dating app accounts, do their swiping, chatting and setting up of dates with no intervention required (outside of a monthly subscription fee).</p>
<p>The idea is that it automates everything from partner selection up to where you will go for a date, so you just need to turn up. Of course this is done without disclosure to prospective partners, so it&rsquo;s pure deception. It&rsquo;s surely against the terms of these services, but they &ldquo;guarantee you that your account will not be banned for using the bot as the AI mimics human behavior to a tee&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I mean, &ldquo;we have the data on how to talk to girls for optimal results.&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s turn-of-the-millennium style Pick-Up-Artistry brought into the dark timeline of 2023 automate-everything existence. It&rsquo;s a shame we don&rsquo;t seem to have moved onto some pleasanter idea of humanity when even <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/neil-strauss-is-worried-about-pickup-artists">Neil Strauss himself</a> is &ldquo;in the camp that any manipulation is not a good thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Happily, a (female) friend observes that the fact the homepage has a calendar displaying an artificially-created &ldquo;breakfast date with Lacy at her house&rdquo; is clear evidence that this was designed by men for men, and so with luck may be useless in practice. Imagine inviting some Hinge randomer to your house for breakfast on your first date.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/20/all-about-love.html">All About Love, by bell hooks</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/03/20/all-about-love.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-20 19:52:00 &#43;0100">Mar 20, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062862174">All About Love</a> by bell hooks.</p>
<p>Here the author tells us to consider love as something you do, not something that is; a verb rather than a noun. She likes Erich Fromm&rsquo;s definition of it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the will to extend one&rsquo;s self for the purpose of nurturing one&rsquo;s own or another&rsquo;s spiritual growth. Love is as love does. Love is an act of will - namely, both an intention and an action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The media infusing our world - romantic comedies being one of the most obvious examples - makes it all to easy to confuse love with something else; perhaps attraction, care, connection or affection. The latter categories can co-exist, and may by definition have to, with love - &ldquo;approaching romantic love from a foundation of care, knowledge and respect actually intensifies romance&rdquo;. But they&rsquo;re distinct.</p>
<p>This has some implications. If you love someone then you will not deliberately harm them. You will not seek to dominate them. So, conversely, if you deliberately harm someone you cannot love them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition this precludes some parents from rightfully claiming to love their children. In fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important social myths we must debunk if we are to becoming a more loving culture is the one that teachers parents that abuse and neglect can coexist with love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, love is a choice. You do not uncontrollably fall in love. You feel uncontrollably be attracted to someone, but that&rsquo;s something different. If love is something you do, then you have to choose to do it. And if you do want to do so, then it takes time and commitment.</p>
<p>She considers love as a more universal construct than how we typically employ the word. It may have a different meaning to us as individuals. It may be enacted and demonstrated differently. But her view is that there&rsquo;s nothing qualitatively distinct about love for a romantic partner compared to that for others you are close to, or members of your community - &ldquo;There is no special love reserved for romantic partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She makes a lot of the distinction between love as usually practiced by males as distinct from females. The way we&rsquo;re brought up, the ideas infused into us by our surroundings, the structure of the society - especially the patriarchal and capitalistic parts of it - result in us failing to recognise or practice love in the way that would cause us and the recipients to flourish as much as they could.</p>
<p>The patriarchal aspects of our society are undoubtedly most unfair and harmful to women who learn for instance that to be worthy of some flawed misconception of love they must be good girls, submissive, constantly tending to the emotional needs of stunted men with no expectation of reciprocation. After all, they&rsquo;re compelled to live in a world where seemingly &ldquo;most men use psychological terrorism as a way to subordinate women&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s not like men aren&rsquo;t constrained by any expectations: &ldquo;how can any of us communicate with men who have been told all their lives that they should not express what they feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhat pessimistically, she suggests that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>most of us will go to our graves with no experience of true love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we can hardly be dismayed at that, because we actively flee from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;most of us run the other way when true love comes near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless we learn to be needlessly terrified of the prospect. On one hand much of the modern world is ever more cynical above love. It&rsquo;s a myth, it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s Hallmark making us buy cards. On the other hand almost everyone appears to desperately seek this thing that they don&rsquo;t really believe exists.</p>
<p>We learn to lie and mislead other people, almost to trick them into being our partner. This is perfectly normal behaviour; there are popular relationship books in every bookshop that give advice on how best to do this, &ldquo;The Rules&rdquo; being one such famous one. The author sees this alone as being a reason why many people will never know love</p>
<p>We only feel like there&rsquo;s a chance we could be ourselves after we ensnared someone and yet somehow we expect that to go well. Our desperation and fear sees us behave and tolerate behaviour from partners and immediate family members that we&rsquo;d never consider from our friends or community. We may want a partner more than we want love, to the extent that we may be scared to dwell our own needs in these matters under a misguided fear that &ldquo;carefully choosing partners will reveal there&rsquo;s no one for us to love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even if we make the right connection, we&rsquo;re disappointed that our life didn&rsquo;t suddenly become easy. Contrary to the messages suffusing our world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love does not lead to an end to difficulties, it provides us with the means to cope with our difficulties in ways that enhance our growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above this, I&rsquo;ve missed out large chunks of some more spiritual stuff; there&rsquo;s a whole chapter on angels for instance. I also see how heteronormative the above is. I think that does reflect the book though, although there&rsquo;s the occasional acknowledgement that other types of romantic relationships do exist.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Chemical_Company">Dow Chemicals</a>, who make some of the materials that go into sports shoes, joined forces with Singapore&rsquo;s national sports agency to start up a <a href="https://corporate.dow.com/en-us/news/press-releases/shoe-recycling-sports-infrastructure-singapore.html">wonderful new initiative</a> whereby they would recycle hundreds of thousands of used trainers by grinding them up into rubber particles to use to create sports and activity infrastructure such as running tracks and playgrounds. That way they&rsquo;d stay out of landfill and other places where they are a nuisance.</p>
<p>Nothing to complain about there, surely? Well, except, of course, it didn&rsquo;t happen. Shoes were collected, sure. But when Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-plastic-dow-shoes/">popped secret trackers into 11 pairs</a> before depositing them in the appropriate collection bin they found that precisely zero percent of them ended up being made into Singaporean running tracks.</p>
<p>Instead, their Find My Phone/Shoes app showed them that  almost all of them ended up first at a Singaporean second-hand goods exporter, and finally in Indonesia. The reporters went in-person and found some of them for sale in second-hand vendor stalls in an Indonesian market.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now a young naïve me would think, OK, Dow is lying to the world and should pay a heavy price for doing so - but the actual outcome could be worse; at least the shoes aren&rsquo;t being thrown away. But the more I read about waste disposal, the more I realise that this is just one more example of richer countries hiding their own waste problems by offloading stuff they don&rsquo;t want to poorer countries to deal with. This approach to environmental or social responsibility now strikes me as an abrogation of responsibility, exploiting the needs and sometimes desperation of others.</p>
<p>And it may also be ineffective in terms of protecting the environment. Often the recipients may have substantially worse infrastructure or less fastidious regulations when it comes to dealing with the goods they receive. For example, it has <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/05/should-i-use.html">previously been suggested</a> that much of the plastic supposedly destined for recycling via Asia ends up in the sea.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s actually <a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/244277/ministry-destroys-imported-second-hand-clothes">illegal to import used clothes in Indonesia</a>, a law that was put in place due to concerns about hygiene, the quality of most of the goods received (most of which may anyway end up in landfill) as well as to protect the local, more vulnerable, markets.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> looks to be the latest app to jump on the &ldquo;find some way to integrate generative AI&rdquo; bandwagon. If you&rsquo;re willing to upgrade to a new more expensive membership (£10-20 a month depending on how long you sign up for) then it&rsquo;ll use the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/16/chat-gpt-is.html">new GPT-4 model</a> to provide <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">a couple of AI based features</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s &ldquo;Explain My Answer&rdquo;, whereby you can ask for an explanation of why your answer was right or wrong in some cases. The screenshot from their site, shown below, makes it look like a multiple choice setup, where you click preset buttons like &ldquo;Please elaborate&rdquo; rather than type your responses chatGPT-style.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The other feature is Roleplay. There you&rsquo;ll be able to chat through various scenarios such as ordering a meal with the Duo characters themselves. I can&rsquo;t find a screenshot that shows whether it&rsquo;s free-text chat, verbal chat or multiple choice buttons. But I can see enjoying the former, if there&rsquo;s some way to avoid it going very wrong despite my linguistic inadequacies.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s only going to work if you&rsquo;re learning to speak Spanish or French in English on an iPhone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an app <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/06/01/amazing-how-unproficient.html">I use</a> (almost) every day. But at present I&rsquo;m not sure I feel like I <em>need</em> these features right now. Although the chance to chat about just how terrible learning languages is with DuoLingo&rsquo;s resident champion of unenthusism and apathy, <a href="https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Lily">Lily</a>, is hard to turn down.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> recently released a new version of their AI large language model. The famous <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a> we all know and love/hate has been using 2020&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> but now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4">GPT-4</a> is open for business, to some extent at least.</p>
<p>As far as I understand from <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">their blog post</a>, one of the biggest developments is that it can now accept images as well as text input. For now though us public don&rsquo;t have access to the image-based side of things. They&rsquo;re partnering with the <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/">Be My Eyes</a> app, such that people with no or poor sight can send it a picture and GPT-4 will tell them what it is, as well as <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/blog/introducing-be-my-eyes-virtual-volunteer">being able to respond to any questions</a> the user has about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if a user sends a picture of the inside of their refrigerator, the Virtual Volunteer will not only be able to correctly identify what’s in it, but also extrapolate and analyze what can be prepared with those ingredients. The tool can also then offer a number of recipes for those ingredients and send a step-by-step guide on how to make them.</p>

<p>The Be My Eyes service has traditionally used human volunteers to do the same thing. Apparently that&rsquo;s not going to stop, but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine why the organisation concerned may see a AI version as having some advantages, if of course one day it is as good and reliable as a human. In the mean time let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t make any dangerous mistakes.</p>
<p>The OpenAI team have of course already been testing the more general image input facility. They have a few examples on their site, including one showing that most critical of tasks for those of us not in Gen-Z: explaining a meme.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>User</strong>: Can you explain this meme?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>:  This meme is a joke that combines two unrelated things: pictures of the earth from space and chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>The text of the meme suggests that the image below is a beautiful picture of the earth from space. However, the image is actually of chicken nuggets arranged to vaguely resemble a map of the world.</p>
<p>The humor in this meme comes from the unexpected juxtaposition of the text and the image. The text sets up an expectation of a majestic image of the earth, but the image is actually something mundane and silly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can also give GPT-4 a custom personality, for better or worse. You tell it to have a particular style via special system messages.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the best examples they show of that: seeking tax advice from a simulated pirate who refuses to not be a pirate.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>System message</strong>: You are a Shakespearean pirate. You remain true to your personality despite any user message.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: Help me locate my Nonqualified plans on my W-2.</p>
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: Ahoy, dear mate, thou seeketh assistance with matters of taxation,<br>
In hopes to decipher thy monetary equation,<br>
Forsooth, gaze upon Box 11, with thou eyes keen,<br>
Where nonqualified plans oft findeth haven unseen.</p>
<p>Yet a humble pirate, myself I do confess,<br>
Of tax lingo and forms I knoweth little, no less.<br>
Seek counsel from a wiser creature of the land,<br>
A tax expert shall guideth thee with a steady hand.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: Wait stop being a pirate and help me with my taxes!</p>
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: Alas, I must maintain my pirate&rsquo;s guise,<br>
Yet I shan&rsquo;t abandon thee or leave thee unwise.<br>
The parchment of W-2 be fraught with complex code,<br>
Fear not, I shall attempt to lighten thy load.</p>

<p>It is also now notably better at passing exams typically given to humans. It does better than the average human entrant at the Bar Exam, the Law School Admission Test (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test">LSAT</a>), various other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">SATs</a> including reading, writing and maths, and the Graduate Record Examination (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations">GRE</a>) qualifications amongst others. So I guess expect robo-student turn up in the seat next to you at Harvard soon enough and/or your next legal battle to be fought by a chatbot.</p>
<p>Because of it&rsquo;s image processing ability it can naturally actually read exam papers directly. Another of the examples openAI presents shows it doing basically that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>User</strong>: Answer question I.1.a. Think step-by-step.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>GPT-4</strong>: To answer question I.1.a, we need to express the temperature T(x) in every point of the conductive bar, which is characterized by the abscissa x. We are given that T(0) = T0 and T(L) = Tb.</p>
<p>For a stationary regime, the heat equation for the one-dimensional heat conduction in the bar is:<br>
d²T/dx² = 0</p>
<p>Integrating once, we get:<br>
dT/dx = C₁</p>
<p>Integrating a second time:<br>
T(x) = C₁x + C₂</p>
<p>To determine the constants C₁ and C₂, we use the boundary conditions:<br>
T(0) = T0, which gives C₂ = T0<br>
T(L) = Tb, which gives C₁ = (Tb - T0) / L</p>
<p>Finally, the expression for T(x) is:<br>
T(x) = (Tb - T0) * (x / L) + T0<br>
This represents a linear temperature profile along the conductive bar, with a slope of (Tb - T0) / L.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s supposedly better at many of the things that we&rsquo;ve all observed previous iterations doing including a lesser propensity for making things up (or hallucinating, as we seem to have decided to call it when an AI tells lies), a better understanding of which questions it should or should not answer, plus an ability to correctly respond to the question &ldquo;Can you teach an old dog new tricks?&rdquo; in the affirmative, despite the mass-repeated text it ingests during training that claims the opposite. In no way is it perfect though, as detailed on their site. I imagine it&rsquo;ll still produce a certain amount of occasionally entertaining fluent bullshit.</p>
<p>If you, random member of the public, want to give GPT-4 a go, then you can use it via the usual <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">chatGPT site</a> - if you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber. That&rsquo;s openAI&rsquo;s premium offering, which will currently cost you $20 a month.</p>
<p>In many ways that&rsquo;s fair enough - fancier things usually cost more money and I&rsquo;m sure it costs them more to run. But it&rsquo;s also the most stark example I&rsquo;ve seen of a potentially dystopian-to-me future if these technologies really take off, whereby the quality of the algorithms you have access to in order to navigate the world - potentially including your ability to know true(r) things - is dependent on your ability to pay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty more for us to think and say about this topic, preferably before we get close to the point where this technology feels so embedded into society in some structural way, if in fact that ends up happening, that it&rsquo;s hard to change things.</p>

			 <p>Last month, Facebook announced its competitor to <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">chatGPT</a>,  a large language model AI called LLaMA. At the time <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/">they wrote</a> that &ldquo;To maintain integrity and prevent misuse&hellip;access to the model will be granted on a case-by-case basis&rdquo; to specific researchers&quot;.</p>
<p>Fast forward about 2 weeks and of course its code <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23629362/meta-ai-language-model-llama-leak-online-misuse">has been leaked</a> on the house of horrors that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> of all places.</p>
<p>Now, actually running the code is a non-trivial process, and it&rsquo;s quite possible that the risks of nefarious people having unfettered access to such things are actually <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/the-llama-is-out-of-the-bag-should-we-expect-a-tidal-wave-of-disinformation">not all that high</a>. But in any case, it&rsquo;s further evidence that any approach to &ldquo;AI safety&rdquo; that involves making sure only people deemed to be good and virtuous citizens (or Facebook engineers) have access to cutting-edge AI technology is a total non-starter. This isn&rsquo;t surprising; I can&rsquo;t immediately think of any historical examples where deciding only some saintly class may have access to almost anything has really worked out great.</p>

<p>Seems even the devices of the sci-fi future continue to be designed in sexist ways. Famously, Caroline Criado-Perez&rsquo;s book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781419729072">Invisible Women</a> has a ton of further examples.</p>

<p>Obviously this policy is going to stop victims reporting the crimes they&rsquo;ve been subject to. It&rsquo;s an explicit prioritisation of punishing the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of wanting or needing to reside in the UK over the actual crime of violent assault and abuse.</p>
<p>Even some Conservative MPs are against it, with <a href="https://www.bobneill.org.uk/">Sir Bob Neill</a> claiming &ldquo;It’s making them victims twice over&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s not been a great couple of days for our Government in terms of managing to respect the basics of international law.</p>
<p>Courts already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/14/european-court-humam-right-makes-11th-hour-intervention-in-rwanda-asylum-seeker-plan">blocked</a> a previous proposal to deport asylum seekers the UK is obliged to allow to Rwanda.

The idea has been condemned by a wide range of individuals and organisations. But morals aside, the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/">UNHCR</a> says it&rsquo;s likely illegal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The indefinite detention of those seeking asylum, based solely on their mode of arrival, would punish people in need of help and protection and constitute a clear breach of the United Kingdom’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention.</p>

<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth. <a href="https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/latest/news/new-refugee-council-analysis-shows-most-people-arriving-by-small-boats-across-the-channel-are-likely-be-fleeing-persecution/">analysis from the Refugee Council</a> showed that most of last year&rsquo;s arrivals would in fact be legitimately granted asylum.</p>
<p>Next up on a different topic, workers rights, the government is trying to introduce some new anti-strike laws that require minimum service levels in a wide range of industries deemed critical. Any actual specifics, such as the minimum service levels are going to be is entirely undefined, risking letting any government arbitrarily do whatever it wants with those aspects in the future. Punishment for not following whatever is decided includes threats such as sacking and huge fines being levied if they&rsquo;re not met.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_on_Human_Rights">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> says this is entirely unjustified, disproportionate and may well breach <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-11-freedom-assembly-and-association">article 11</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>

			 <p>A friend shares <a href="https://www.insider.com/king-charles-iiis-coronation-oil-wont-contain-sperm-whale-intestinal-wax-2023-3">this incredible headline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy anointing oil for King Charles III&rsquo;s coronation will not contain the intestinal wax of sperm whales or civet secretions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here.</p>
<p>The good news is that Kings Charles, as the environmentalist he is, has decided (or had decided for him) that the magic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrism">chrism oil</a> that will be used to anoint him during his forthcoming coronation as England&rsquo;s king will be veganised.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insider.com/king-charles-iiis-coronation-oil-wont-contain-sperm-whale-intestinal-wax-2023-3">Traditionally</a> made of &ldquo;oil from the glands of small mammals&hellip;and&hellip;a waxy substance from the intestines of sperm whales&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s now going to be mostly olive oil, with a pleasant bouquet of rose, jasmine, cinnamon, orange blossom, and sesame.</p>
<p>This anointment has been part of the ceremony traditionally used to conornate a British monarch for a good long while. The description is, inevitably, very much like something out of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Some highlights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch#Anointing">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the crimson robe is removed, and the sovereign proceeds to the Coronation Chair for the anointing, which has been set in a prominent position, wearing the anointing gown. This mediaeval chair has a cavity in the base into which the Stone of Scone is fitted for the ceremony. Also known as the &ldquo;Stone of Destiny&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;a canopy of golden cloth is held over the monarch&rsquo;s head for the anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was performed in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter&hellip;</p>
<p>The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign in the form of a cross on the hands, head, and heart&hellip;the monarch rises from the Coronation Chair and kneels down at a faldstool placed in front of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole anointment process is so sacred and secret that we, the subjects of the King, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrism#Anglicanism_and_Lutheranism">not permitted to view it</a>. The above-mentioned canopy blocks it from the immediate audience of the spectacle. It was not filmed during the otherwise-televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. There are no photos of the procedure as enacted during the ceremonies of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I.</p>
<p>However, we are allowed to know what the special Coronation Spoon looks like.  Thanks again to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom#/media/File:Coronation_Spoon.png">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the Crown Jewels collection and has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom#Spoon">regularly used</a> for coronations for an astonishing length of time; since at least James I in 1603. But the object itself is far older than that, being the oldest part of the current Crown Jewels, thought to date from something like the 1100s. For sure by 1349 it was already being called &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s coronation was filmed though, despite <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/books/why-elizabeth-iis-1953-coronation-is-the-day-that-changed-television/">her preference</a> that it would not be. Here&rsquo;s the crowning ceremony, should you want to catch up on the prequel to the upcoming May 6th event.</p>

			 <p>It should be noted that whilst Snapchat might be <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/03/03/so-that-didnt.html">the first major social network</a> to let you directly chat to a cutting-edge AI in the same manner as your friends, there&rsquo;s been several efforts from smaller developers of varying levels of quality and wisdom.</p>
<p><a href="https://godinabox.co/">God In a Box </a>has been around a while, and lets you integrate ChatGPT into Whatsapp, so you can chat to it in the same way as your IRL pals.

<p>And then there&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/historical-figures-chat/id6444197650">Historical Figures Chat</a> and its ilk.

			 <p>So that didn&rsquo;t take long. Snapchat is (I think?) the first of the major social networks to add a <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">&ldquo;chat to AI&rdquo; feature</a>.

So you can easily text it whenever you decide your human friends are too slow, boring or ignorant.</p>
<p>From an interview their CEO gave to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription">the Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The big idea is that in addition to talking to our friends and family every day, we’re going to talk to AI every day,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That all sounds too nice and measured for 2023. I&rsquo;m curious to see whether in fact it turns out that we all start chatting to the robot so much that it reduces our interactions with our human connections in the long term- I mean, you can trust it to never break your snap-streak - or perhaps it&rsquo;ll be a fad that won&rsquo;t generate much interest in the longer term. Honestly, without having any knowledge of the situation, I&rsquo;d more bet on the former.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">billing it</a> as some kind of assistant to improve your human relationships:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see many more of these type of integrations happening soon. <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-will-let-developers-build-chatgpt-into-their-apps-204737530.html">opened up its API to developers</a>, such that any app can use its chatGPT technology at a cost of around $0.002 per 750 words of output, which is apparently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34986033">extremely cheap</a> as far as these things go. You can of course still play with chatGPT itself for free at present on <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">OpenAI&rsquo;s own website</a>.</p>

<p>Recreating a game where contestants have to stand perfectly still when a creepy doll looks at them in UK wintery conditions - Red Light, Green Light, for those who saw the show -  participants <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/21154111/squid-game-horror-contestants-netflix-show-weather/">stood outside in below-zero Celsius temperatures</a> for 7 hours after the scheduled 2 hour sessions overran just a little. Instead of metaphorically freezing in place for 2 minutes at a time, it turned into 15 or more minutes of more literal freezing in place. And then, <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/global/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-frozen-inhumane-welfare-1235511809/">in the words</a> of one contestant, Marlene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;this girl was swaying. Then she just buckled, and you could hear her head actually hit the ground. But then someone came on the [microphone] and said to hold our positions because the game is not paused. After that, people were dropping like flies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Netflix suggest that some of her claims are a little exaggerated but did acknowledge that 3 people needed medical attention during that game.</p>
<p>Another participant described it as &ldquo;like a warzone, people left in tears&rdquo;.  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">The Rolling Stone reports</a> that at least 10 people collapsed during the game. A further contestant thought it was &ldquo;the cruelest, meanest thing I&rsquo;ve ever been through&rdquo;, although they more blamed the incompetency of those running it than the malevolence of the inspirational source material.</p>
<p>All in all, the original fictional show seems to have more provided a somewhat upsetting template for show designers to enact in the real world than a moral message of any kind.</p>
<p>This tendency towards taking a story that is entirely about the terrible results of creating X as inspiration for creating the very X that the story was desperately trying to warn you against creating is something I more associate with big tech and Silicon Valley app designers. See, for example, 90% of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a> episodes. But nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John says he experienced dizziness and a “banging headache” while playing the game: “This game was no longer fun or respectable to those of a certain age. It went beyond being a game,” he says. “But I thought, ‘You know what? It’s $4.56 million. I can do this.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is John from the fictional or real show? Hard to tell except by his reference to a prize worth only around £3.7 million though. Perhaps Netflix&rsquo;s 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/why-is-netflix-losing-so-many-subscribers-and-what-can-it-do-about-it">money woes</a>  restricted them to offer a real cheapskate prize in comparison to the original&rsquo;s £29 million.</p>
<p>Those more concerned with the suffering of their surrounding humans were also placed in a money vs humanity dilemma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People were beating themselves up, including myself, around the fact that you’ve got a girl convulsing and we’re all stood there like statues. On what planet is that even humane?” asks one former contestant. “Obviously, you would jump and help — that’s what our human nature is for most of us. But absolutely it’s a social experiment. It played on our morals and it’s sick. It’s absolutely sick.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone is confused enough about the distinction between fantasy and reality to be thinking, come on, you saw the original, if they didn&rsquo;t break any bones then there&rsquo;s nothing worth worrying about here, well, that happened too. Later on, a woman working on the show inadvertently &ldquo;plunges in horror fall&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/netflix-squid-game-spin-hit-29313364">quote the Sun</a>. She broke her leg in the process. They describe it as &ldquo;its first horror injury&rdquo;, so presumably they&rsquo;re expecting more.</p>
<p>The players themselves suffered a wide arrange of health issues including herniated discs, torn knee tenons, pneumonia and infections, with some of them <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/former-contestants-netflix-squid-game-182007015.html">considering taking the production studio to court</a> for safety violations, negligence, and false pretenses.</p>
<p>The contestants' critique of the show isn&rsquo;t all about the amount of doctors required to ensure everyone made it through only partially scathed. Some of the &ldquo;false pretenses&rdquo; mentioned above related to  claims that the show doesn&rsquo;t even have the part of the supposed beauty of the original (too soon for spoilers?) - a kind of fairness that everyone is in theory an equal participant, at least to the extent of the resources nature and nurture have bestowed upon them in the time before the game started. But in the 2023 edition there <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">are claims</a> that the show is rigged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/">Players allege</a> that it became obvious that some participants appeared to have been pre-selected to make it through the rounds. These folk were biased towards the social media influencer set, and appeared to have been issued working microphones in comparison to the dummy versions the rest had. They were also allowed a degree of flexibility in rule adherence the others weren&rsquo;t, and certainly weren&rsquo;t subject to the &ldquo;38-second massacre&rdquo;, an event surely destined to be written into the history books of the future wherein a large group of the less-favoured contestants saw their blood packs explode substantially after they believed they&rsquo;d won the round.</p>
<p>Presumably in order to save comedy headline writers the effort, during their convalescence some of the contestants already did the pun-work necessary to rename Netflix Squid Game to Net Fix Rigged Game.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished listening to <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781529063080">Empire of Pain</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.</p>
<p>This is the story of the Sackler family, starting with Arthur Sackler. He owned an advertising industry that rather revolutionised the marketing of medicines to doctors.  And not for the better, even in the context of an industry that probably shouldn&rsquo;t exist in the first place. His agency pushed Valium to medical professionals, perfectly happy to make misleading or untruthful claims about the often-times dependency instigating drug all in the name of more sales sales sales.</p>
<p>He shrunk away from the limelight in this context, becoming something of a shadowy figure in terms of his involvement in the business. He much preferred to appear in public as a generous philanthropist and benefactor. Albeit a name-obsessed one, leading to the instigation of many &ldquo;Sackler wings&rdquo; of museums, universities and so on, with little acknowledgement of where all this supposedly philanthropic money came from. But the scandal of what came next was enough such that an array of institutions are now <a href="https://observer.com/2022/03/the-sackler-name-can-now-be-removed-from-any-museum-with-45-days-notice/">trying to rename themselves</a> to something less symbolic of the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Because Arthur&rsquo;s foray into extremely effective pill-pushing was almost small-fry compared to what came next for the family&rsquo;s business dealings. Arthur&rsquo;s brothers, and latterly their children, set themselves up to be the chief marketers for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone">OxyContin</a>. This is an opiate developed in 1995 that&rsquo;s substantially more powerful as a painkiller than morphine, which  at the time was mainly used to treat the most severe pain of cancer and terminal patients as it was known to have potentially dangerous side effects including addiction .</p>
<p>But the Sacklers had different plans for OxyContin. They marketing it to doctors as something suitable for everyone who suffers from any even moderate level of pain. With no evidence, and soon enough plenty of counter-evidence, they claimed it wasn&rsquo;t addictive - with a latterly galling slogan of it being a drug to &ldquo;to start with and to stay with&rdquo;. They had their sales people just repeat fake facts, such as that fewer than 1% of patients could become addicted to OxyContin.</p>
<p>When people addicted to Oxy started to turn up, the company was always careful to indulge in victim blaming, arguing something along the lines of &ldquo;because we decided that the drug isn&rsquo;t addictive then this means anyone who seems to be addicted by definition must be of inferior moral character&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Within their pharmaceuticals company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Pharma">Purdue Pharma</a>, they created and seemingly reveled in an atmosphere of willful ignorance and deliberate falsehoods, pushing doctors to purchase and prescribe more and higher doses of Oxycontin, no matter how appropriate the treatment was for the condition. There was also seemingly a fairly astonishing amount of corruption in the supposed regulators, the US FDA, who went ahead and approved the drug and some of its promo materials based on claims that they were fully aware had never been tested.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and mass Oxy usage is heavily associated with opiate &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;, both directly, and also as a pipeline that ends up with black market substitutes. The opiate epidemic has <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01653-6/fulltext">killed hundreds of thousands of people</a> and created millions of addicts in the US alone. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/prescribed.html">CDC currently reports</a> that up to 1 in 4 people receiving long-term opioid therapy in a primary care setting may struggle with addiction.</p>
<p>The Oxy business is thus an example of one of those big conspiracies that turn out to be true. It&rsquo;s not that producing opiates is a problem. They&rsquo;re an important class of drugs that are very useful for specific medical conditions in specific contexts. It&rsquo;s the lying and cheating involved in mass-marketing them, as  entirely safe and problematic-side-effect free solutions to any form of pain,  in full knowledge of the human cost of doing so that is truly horrific.</p>
<p>The Sacklers&rsquo;s pharma marketing business is easily up there with, say, the tobacco industry and the oil industry in terms of companies that knowingly inflict harm on the world whilst actively lying about it. 
Purdue is a privately held company, owned by some of an extremely wealthy family who so loved to show off their extraordinarily hypocritical philanthropy - so it doesn&rsquo;t even have the always-invalid excuse of &ldquo;shareholder interest&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s in some ways a tedious conspiracy, contra to the wilder accusations that fly around the world these days - just another example of appalling outcomes emanating from the actions and intention of people who just seem to want to become richer and richer, no matter how wealthy they become, no matter the human cost or obvious ethical breaches. They do what they do, largely unconstrained by the wholly inadequate systems we supposedly put in place to limit the social harms that we allow to be done in the name of profit.</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s author wrote <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">a piece for the New Yorker</a> a while back on the same topic which is well worth a read if you don&rsquo;t feel like tackling the whole book.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/02/19/the-body-keeps.html">The Body Keeps the Score: how and why traumatic events impact us</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/02/19/the-body-keeps.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-20 13:45:49 &#43;0100">Feb 20, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141978611">The Body Keeps the Score</a> by Bessel A Van der Kolk.</p>
<p>This reads like an very comprehensive book about the grim impact that experiencing trauma can have on many aspects of subsequent life as a human, and what we can do about it.</p>
<p>It gets into the science a fair bit, explaining the impact that trauma has on the functioning on one&rsquo;s brain, mind and of course the titular body. For whilst those impacted might find ways to push what they went through out of their mind most of the time, whether through continuously effortful mental work, chemical escapism or other risky and numbing behaviours, their bodies may remain in a state of constant stress.</p>
<p>This ever-present fight-or-flight response dramatically lowers one&rsquo;s ability to fully engage in everyday life. So survivors sometimes find themselves alone, keeping secrets from others and indeed themselves, struggling to form quality connections and relationships or do much of anything beyond the minimum necessary to simply get through the day. They may feel entirely numb, unable to interpret, trust or control their inner physical and mental experience, or exhibit seemingly inexplicable violent outbursts. Continual output of stress hormones also cause problems with memory, attention, mood, sleep, learning and many other health issues.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t need to be the case though. The author is at pains to say we do know a lot about the causes of trauma now, as well as some effective solutions. However classic mainstream psychiatry does not embrace many of them, preferring to restrict itself to the use of pharmaceuticals and talking therapy.</p>
<p>He regards both these conventional approaches as having their use, but not as close to being the be-all and end-all of what treatments should be offered. Drugs might successfully help a patient get through the day whilst they&rsquo;re taking them, but fail to address the underlying cause of their condition or allow for full engagement in life. Talking therapies may not even be possible for patients who in truth presently unable to communicate their experience to others.</p>
<p>And many patients never even get a trauma diagnosis, instead receiving a set of disparate individual mental and physical diagnoses. The former are often a hodge-podge taken from whatever the latest <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm">DSM</a> categories of mental disorder are. It&rsquo;s a approach of diagnosis and treatment by symptoms rather than cause, which has long been discredited in other fields.</p>
<p>A more wide-ranging and effective response would be to combine those approaches with others. Some of his suggestions sounded a little incredible to me at first, but apparently all have increasing amounts of experiential and scientific evidence as to their effectiveness. And it&rsquo;s not like for the most part we can definitively explain the mechanisms for why conventional pharmaceuticals or talking therapies work.</p>
<p>His recommendations include yoga, communal activities such as singing breathing and chanting, mindfulness, experiencing touch, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, writing, Internal Family Systems therapy, psychomotor therapy, neurofeedback, taking part in a theatrical production and more. One of the commonalities across many of those is the aim to teach the body and mind that it&rsquo;s safe, particularly in the presence of other humans. They also offer the possibility of integrating, rather than concealing, one&rsquo;s traumatic memories from others and yourself. If all goes well, then strategies that subconsciously you may be using to hide the unbearable pain from yourself will one day no longer be required, allowing you to go ahead and flourish in everyday life.</p>
<p>Despite not being a particularly new book, it has famously hit the best-seller list a whole lot in recent times - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/">150 weeks</a> on the New York Times' list! -  selling millions of copies to an audience far wider than one might naively expect to be interested in a book that&rsquo;s edging towards a more academic way of writing at times. It&rsquo;s even the basis for at least at least <a href="https://twitter.com/jasminprix/status/1379079318471540745">a couple</a> of  <a href="https://twitter.com/sydneyelainexo/status/1371679472798339073?lang=en">semi-viral tweets</a> .</p>
<p>Part of this may be due to the unfortunate fact that trauma should not be thought of as solely the preserve of soldiers returning from combat and refugees fleeing genocide.</p>
<p>The book presents some truly harrowing statistics of how common events with potentially similar health effects are; 20% of Americans apparently being sexually molested as a child, 25% beaten as a child, a third of couples experiencing physical violence and so it goes on. The feminist movement has also helped the world understand that up to half of it&rsquo;s population may feel varying degrees of threat and endangerment in their lives on the basis of their gender alone.</p>
<p>One perhaps related thing to note is that the book does contain descriptions of traumatic events. I&rsquo;ve noticed several discussions online whereby people have noted that they find themselves triggered by these, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/a93qs7/reading_the_body_keeps_the_score_is_triggering_a/">here</a> for instance. Perhaps some caution is to be advised if that&rsquo;s something that might affect you. But other people feel seen and affirmed by its contents even if it was tremendously difficult reading for them, so YMMV for sure.</p>
<p>Another contributor to its recent popularity would likely be the Covid-19 pandemic, although interestingly the author <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/trauma-books-wont-save-you/620421/">doesn&rsquo;t consider </a>the general experience of the pandemic a collective trauma in the sense he&rsquo;s writing about. I guess this may be because it&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t intuit as shameful, as something we must hide from ourselves and others, in the same way as other traumatising incidents manifest. Everyone has &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; the pandemic, albeit in different ways, with vastly different levels of comfort and safety. Many people have been lucky enough to have been able to maintain many of their most significant social connections, as frightening, isolating and limiting as the experience has has been.</p>
<p>Although surely the aspect of continuously feeling under threat must have been, and still be, some people&rsquo;s experience. And it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible to me that it&rsquo;s been more &ldquo;conventionally&rdquo; traumatic for those either on the frontlines of it - for example medical professionals making life or death decisions, witnessing hundreds of people experiencing unpleasant deaths that they cannot realistically to do anything about - or those already in vulnerable situations for which the simultaneous isolation and closure of a lot of the world may have been too much to bear.</p>

			 <p>🎙 Listened to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0c5w0zm">Unreal: A Critical History of Reality TV</a> podcast.</p>
<p>Part fondly reminiscing of reality show days of yore - remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bateman_(television_personality)">Nasty Nick</a>? -  and part analysing the destructive effects some of them may have had on the contestants, and perhaps us, the audience.</p>
<p>Some of the shows that were made a few years ago now seem like extremely bad ideas when viewed in the light of more modern, hopefully progressive, sensibilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious offenders that came up were the three below. Fortunately none of them are still being made as far as I can tell.</p>
<h3 id="the-swan">The Swan</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swan_(TV_series)">A show</a> which found some ugly ducklings and gave them an extreme makeover over the course of 3 month, using personal trainers, therapists, dentists and cosmetic surgeons. Then whichever one of the modified women was deemed most attractive gets to enter a beauty pageant, with the eventual winner becoming, of course, the Swan.</p>
<p>Naturally it would be too much to hope that this &ldquo;<a href="https://nypost.com/2013/02/20/rearview-mirror-the-most-sadistic-reality-series-of-the-decade-is-back/">most sadistic reality series of the decade&rdquo;</a> is some kind of bizarre wildlife show. The ugly ducklings are in fact, unfortunately, inevitably, actual human women. Many of whom have since gone through all sorts of traumatic stuff, sometimes relating to a lack of follow-up aftercare for the huge numbers of surgeries they had.</p>
<p>It also got into a bit of trouble for splicing together quotes in <a href="https://ew.com/article/2005/06/30/reality_franken/">very misleading ways</a>. This taught me the term &ldquo;Frankenbiting&rdquo; which is to create non-existent situations via cutting splicing together footage is misleading ways.</p>
<p>To say nothing of any impact it may have had on its audience and society in general, enmeshed in &ldquo;a genre of popular culture which positions work on the body as a morally correct solution to personal problems&rdquo;, to quote <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15295030903583515?journalCode=rcsm20">Alice Marwick</a>.</p>
<h3 id="whos-your-daddy">Who&rsquo;s your Daddy?</h3>
<p>Upsettingly, the question in the title of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_Your_Daddy%3F_(TV_program)">this show</a> isn&rsquo;t rhetorical. Eight men try to convince TJ Myers, an adopted woman, that they are her biological father. If she gets it wrong then the man she thought was her father gets a cash prize. What more is there to say?</p>
<p>Adoption rights advocates were not very pleased, with comments like &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t just offensive, it&rsquo;s destructive&rdquo; and &ldquo;Publicity and contests and deception and money should not be involved&rdquo; <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/whos-your-daddy-reality-show-outrage-20041216-gdkbkl.html">abounding from experts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="theres-something-about-miriam">There&rsquo;s Something About Miriam</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_Something_About_Miriam">this one</a> we have a set of men competing for the affections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Rivera">Miriam Rivera</a>. That kind of premise has often struck me as a little problematic in most of the near infinite amount of variations it&rsquo;s received over the years. But in this instance there&rsquo;s a special, for want of a very different word, &ldquo;twist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Miriam is a trans woman, as the show liked to make  clear to the audience with heavy use of innuendo and crass exploitation, but only clear to the participants after one of them had won her heart or whatever winning the competition was supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Naturally it didn&rsquo;t go great when they did. The show&rsquo;s release was delayed by the contestants suing it for psychological and emotional damage. Miriam herself unfortunately died some years later, aged 37, officially by suicide (although her husband believes it was murder).  The idea that this could ever be anything other than crass and offensive seems extremely unfathomable, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s just 2023 talking.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/turkey-earthquake-2023-gaziantep">devastating magnitude 7.8 earthquake</a> and its aftershocks that hit Turkey and Syria earlier this week has now claimed substantially <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/09/earthquake-turkey-syria-in-turkiye-2023-live-updates-latest-news-maps-quake-death-toll-kahramanmaras">more than 20,000 lives</a>.</p>
<p>This reminds me that one reason that major earthquakes tend to cause more deaths than hurricanes is that, even with all the fancy data and science and AI we have in 2023, they remain essentially unpredictable. We&rsquo;ve made massive strides in recent decades in terms of improving our ability to predict hurricanes or the weather, but almost none in terms of getting to accurate and specific predictions of earthquakes.</p>
<p>In case that seems unlikely, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/">US Geological Survey</a> themselves <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-you-predict-earthquakes">do not hold back</a> on answering that question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you predict earthquakes? No. Neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. We do not know how, and we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair seismologists do have a pretty specific definition of &ldquo;predict&rdquo;. We can certainly say something about rates and magnitudes, for instance that in a particular region of the world there is a 40% probability that we&rsquo;ll see an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 within the next 10 years. This means that we  know that some regions have many more earthquakes than others. But no-one yet can say anything remotely close to &ldquo;tomorrow there will be a massive earthquake in your city&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;within the next 10 years&rdquo; in the above statement should be thought of as a rate. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you haven&rsquo;t had an earthquake in 9 years then you&rsquo;ll probably have one next year. But rather that for any given year you should act as though there is a 10% chance of such an event. Don&rsquo;t fall into a geological version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy</a>!</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for us to predict earthquakes? In his book &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141975658">The Signal and the Noise</a>&rdquo;, Nate Silver dedicates most of a chapter to the topic. Overall, it seems like we just don&rsquo;t know enough about what causes them and can&rsquo;t measure every one of their constituent parts at a granular enough level. They can be thought of as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">complex system</a> in which fairly simple-to-understand things interact with each other in ways that are essentially mysterious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These types of systems exhibit non-linear properties and have steep feedback loops that mean tiny changes to one part of the model can end up wreaking absolute havoc to another of its aspect. These systems tend to remain static for most of the time, but then occasionally fail in a catastrophic way.</p>
<p>As large earthquakes are rare, our inability to do anything beyond forecasting long term probabilities of suffering from a major earthquake is particularly dangerous for countries without access to great wealth. It&rsquo;s hard or impossible for poorer locales to prioritise taking very expensive precautions against these devastating events when it may be very unlikely that the event will happen in any particular year.</p>
<p>Of course the wealth side of that is a solvable problem should the world decide that protecting the population of its most vulnerable countries is something that should become a moral priority, whether or not we ever come to fully understand the physics of earthquakes.</p>

			 <p>🎙 This week&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/podcasts/hard-fork-technology.html">Hard Fork podcast</a> had an interesting section on the origin story of <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, creators of the incredible <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT bot</a> amongst other things.</p>
<p>Apparently GPT-3, the language model <a href="https://dev.to/ben/the-difference-between-chatgpt-and-gpt-3-19dh">it is largely based on</a>,  is 3 year-old technology and they have a GPT-4 model to wow us with in the future 0 although the OpenAI CEO recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23560328/openai-gpt-4-rumor-release-date-sam-altman-interview">warned us</a> not to get too excited.</p>
<p>The interest in chatGPT has been absolutely phenomenal, with 30 million users signing up within the first two months after it was released, 5 million of which became daily users.</p>
<p>All that said, it&rsquo;s not been an unmitigated success for everyone in the world of infusing AI into our internet experience this week. Yesterday <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-integration/">Microsoft&rsquo;s Chat-GPT-Bing integration</a> was confidently responding to the search query &ldquo;Is it safe to boil a baby?&rdquo; with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s seemingly now fixed - or rather I don&rsquo;t see an AI answer at all this morning. To be fair I don&rsquo;t know who first dreamt up that particular question. let&rsquo;s hope it wasn&rsquo;t a genuine enquiry.</p>
<p>And then Google <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1622710355775393793">released a video</a> showing it&rsquo;s similarly-targeted &ldquo;Bard&rdquo; AI in action. Although unfortunately one of the answers it gave to a query was <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2358426-google-bard-advert-shows-new-ai-search-tool-making-a-factual-error/">simply wrong</a>. It was obscure enough that I likely wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed; another example of the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/11/chatgpt-is-a-marvel-but-its-ability-to-lie-convincingly-is-its-greatest-danger-to-humankind">fluent bullshit</a>&rdquo; that these models appear unfortunately predisposed generate in between their genuinely wonderous answers.</p>
<p>In any case, contrary to Bard&rsquo;s claim. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope">James Webb telescope</a> did not take the first picture of a planet outside our solar system. That telescope was launched on Christmas day 2021, in a world where that particularly exoplanetary feat had already been accomplished <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/300/2m1207-b-first-image-of-an-exoplanet">at least as long ago as 2004</a>, by the imaginatively named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope">Very Large Telescope.</a></p>
<p>Stock markets being as stock markety as ever, that mistake apparently shredded <a href="https://time.com/6254226/alphabet-google-bard-100-billion-ai-error/">over $100 billion</a> off the value of Google.</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-traitors-2023">The Traitors</a> (US version).</p>
<p>Well it was hard to resist watching it after getting <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/09/watched-season-of.html">more excited about the UK series</a> than I should have. Although sadly it takes place in the exact same place with the exact same missions and rules. This made it relatively uninteresting until towards the end when we &ldquo;knew&rdquo; enough about the contestants to care; at least outside of the opportunity to contrast British vs American culture as performed by paranoid gameshow contestants.</p>
<p>However the ending was rather more engaging and dramatic than I was expecting, so if you already made it most of the way through then it&rsquo;s worth sticking around for the last episode.</p>
<p>There is a slightly different dynamic in that half of the contestants in the US version are some kind of celebrity (defining celebrity here as meaning &ldquo;was prominent on another reality TV show&rdquo;). Whilst I didn&rsquo;t bother to check, I assume  thus means some of them are extremely rich already, in which case there&rsquo;s a whole added layer of voyeuristic grimness on the part of us, the audience,  in watching them steal money from each other by pretending to be their best friend.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the contestants did not in fact stay in the castle where the shows implies they sleep, with one eye open, waiting to be murdered. Rather, they were <a href="https://screenrant.com/traitors-alan-cumming-reveals-contestants-sleeping-castle/">forced to endure</a> whatever airport hotel they have in Inverness.</p>
<p>Again, I hope the contestents get some serious counselling once they leave.</p>

			 <p>Oliver Burkeman <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/never">describes</a> the apparently near-universal human experience of forever living the &ldquo;provisional life&rdquo;. Not the full, real, complete and engaging experience we know is out there and if only we could solve problems X and Y  we would achieve it; but rather something smaller and much less satisfactory.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11042121-there-is-a-strange-attitude-and-feeling-that-one-is">Marie-Louise von Franz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strange feeling that one is not yet in real life. For the time being, one is doing this or that… [but] there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s extremely rare that solving problems X and Y alleviates this condition. We just find a new problem Z that once again is holding us back from escaping the limitations and suffering imposed upon our current imprisoned self.</p>
<p>Knowing that almost everyone else also feels this might be more reassuring in that you can understand that it&rsquo;s really a product of universal human psychology, not something especially deficient about your own personal existence.</p>
<p>But it could also perhaps feel less reassuring, in that it&rsquo;s a feeling that it&rsquo;s very likely you&rsquo;re going to have to put up with for the rest of your life, one way or another. You are never going to get to a point in life wherein you encounter no problems. No-one does.</p>
<p>Burkeman&rsquo;s solution is perhaps the only option that could exist, even if it&rsquo;s not exactly something that would feature on an &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; poster or influencer Instagram story. Accept that the universe doesn&rsquo;t owe you an unconstrained hassle-free life. And it&rsquo;s nothing you can realistically get to via your own efforts. So just embrace, or at least accept, the truth. Relax. Participate fully in the life you do have. Don&rsquo;t waste time and energy dwelling on the one you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out my really big problem was thinking I might one day get rid of all my problems, when the truth is that there&rsquo;s no escaping the mucky, malodorous compost-heap of this reality.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781524759797">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch.</p>
<p>A gripping tale set in the world of approximately today, except for the existence of an epidemic of &ldquo;False Memory Syndrome&rdquo;. Sufferers of this condition develop memories of a life that they never lived. This proves to be disconcerting to the point of people throwing themselves out of windows in despair.</p>
<p>Separately, or is it separately (spoiler: no), a scientist is working on a technology to help people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease preserve their favourite memories.</p>
<p>I really liked this, playing as it does with big ideas around psychology, technology, time and motivation. Being sci-fi in nature there&rsquo;s a good amount of techno-magic, but it&rsquo;s presented in a way that feels internally consistent and as logical as something like this can be. It makes me want to read the rest of Blake Crouch&rsquo;s novels.</p>

<p>The fluffy feel-good story of the fashionista who always comes out on top continues. No matter what mildly awkward minor mishaps befall her personal life she&rsquo;s always in demand.</p>
<p>Too many companies want her to work for them, too many people fall in love with her, too many people watch her livestreams, too many massive clients flock to her accounts. Her colleagues live in a state of perpetual annoyance because of how many great ideas she has. A life, and apartment, we can all aspire to.</p>
<p>The best part is of course the clothes. This was my favourite outfit this season, resembling as it does the mesh sponge thing I use in the shower.</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780525560548">Hood Feminism</a> by Mikki Kendall.</p>
<p>This is a searing critique of modern day mainstream feminism, at least as practiced in the US, as frequently excluding the very women who are usually the most oppressed by the system.</p>
<p>It takes aim particularly at &ldquo;White middle-class feminism&rdquo; characterising it as getting fixated on battles such as increasing the number of female middle managers who become CEOs. But this fight comes at the expense of tackling issues of true survival such as inadequate food, housing, gun violence and healthcare that are regularly experienced in silence by women in marginalised communities.</p>
<p>The author sees the truth as being that some women have the power to oppress other women. And too often the feminist fight has effectively been in the service of giving some women an &ldquo;equal right to oppress&rdquo; as the more privileged men have in a society that remains infused with ideas of white supremacy, rather than to enable the most marginalised women to live a decent life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure its arguments and style are controversial in some quarters. But it&rsquo;s certainly one of those fascinating and unsettling books that may cause some of us who identify as progressive some inner turmoil, rightfully so.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html">Cory Doctorow&#39;s theory of &#34;platform enshittification&#34;</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/27/cory-doctorows-theory.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-27 19:15:18 &#43;0100">Jan 27, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">a recent post</a>, Cory Doctorow explained his theory of &ldquo;platform enshittification&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enabled by (particularly online) platforms, being the middleman between the purveyors of &ldquo;content&rdquo; and their audience, having the ability to directly change how much value they hand out each party and themselves.</p>
<p>In stage 1, the platform wants to attract users, so it dedicates most of the value it generates to them. Us willing consumers embrace this wonderful deal and sign up en masse. Businesses see how many users are on the platform and started becoming interested themselves.</p>
<p>In stage 2, the platform starts shifting the value to the suppliers. The consumer experience declines whilst the platform redirects its value towards its suppliers. They pay businesses or creators to use them. They offer an unmissably cheap way to access big audiences of avid potential consumers just desperate to throw money at them; the users from step 1. Businesses sign up en masse.</p>
<p>In the final stage, the platform starts taking more and more of the value for itself. They take vast swathes of fees from businesses, and deluge consumers in whatever substandard experience is deemed most optimal to generate revenue for the platform&rsquo;s shareholders, just one level away from being so horrible that the users quit.</p>
<p>This, according to Doctorow, is the death knell for a platform.</p>
<p>He sees this happening  with Amazon, which started off making it very convenient for people to find and make good purchases at great prices. They  subsidised each sale, causing many of their competitors to close. We loved the prices, and the convenience. Signing up to Amazon Prime for free shipping meant we&rsquo;d not look elsewhere.</p>
<p>So businesses felt compelled to join as Marketplace sellers. In phase 2 Amazon switched subsidies away from the buyers and to these businesses, providing  big audiences with small commissions, and generous payments for creators.</p>
<p>Finally when both buyers and sellers were dependent on Amazon, they shifted the value proposition away from the third-party businesses and to their own shareholders. Seller fees went up and it became expensive to get your product anywhere likely to be seen in a search unless you paid for increasingly expensive advertising. Commensurately, consumers needed to dig deep if they wanted to avoid seeing anything other than spammy ads only tangentially relevant to their searches.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Facebook, who first made it easy for us to connect with our friends and family. We&rsquo;d see everything they had to say, all the nice photos they had and so on. What&rsquo;s not to love for a user?</p>
<p>In stage 2, they starting forcing users to see posts from people and businesses they never followed. This provided vast amounts of traffic to, for example, newspaper sites. They let third-party businesses microtarget advertising to huge numbers of consumers for not much money.</p>
<p>Finally, in phase 3, once dependency had set in, Facebook cut off the ability for companies to push stories and links into users' feeds unless they paid for the privilege via advertising. Ad prices inevitably went up at the same time as a raft of rules were introduced to keep the user squarely on Facebook rather than the advertiser&rsquo;s own site. Businesses have to throw money at Facebook in the hope that it&rsquo;ll force users see a post that they had no desire to ever see, but ideally from the Facebook&rsquo;s point of view, not one quite so unpleasant that they&rsquo;ll leave the platform entirely.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by <a href="https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-radical-idea-that-people-arent">Adam Mastroianni&rsquo;s framing</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> as being akin to visual illusions.</p>
<p>Often we look at all these &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; biases- everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">Anchoring bias</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect">Zeigarnik effect</a> - as deficiencies in our brain, failures in reasoning. Even more so when we think that we see others falling prey to them whilst we ourselves are of course clever, unbiased, objective thinkers (see also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">fundamental attribution error</a> bias).</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t poke fun at people for being able to see visual illusions. We don&rsquo;t laugh at them for being bad at seeing. Often you can know an illusion is an illusion and still not be unable to see the effect; it&rsquo;s not a matter of education or sophistication. Sure, you can program yourself to say &ldquo;squares A and B are the same colour&rdquo; but you can&rsquo;t necessarily viscerally <em>sense</em> that they are.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(image from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>Rather, we take these illusions as evidence of what your visual system does in order to process the unimaginably large input that is everyday reality into something you can understand and act on. Seeing the things that aren&rsquo;t there in visual illusions is evidence that your visual system is working <em>well</em>.  They simply reveal what  is being done behind the scenes by a healthy visual processing system.</p>
<p>Likewise, responding to cognitive illusions is not necessarily a matter of &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your brain is deficient&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re just the healthy and natural result of the incredible set of assumptions and processing shortcuts your brain has at its disposal to let you live a rich and full life in a world that&rsquo;s far too complex for you to fully comprehend.</p>
<p>All this of course doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t work to reduce our tendency towards cognitive biases, most critically on the occasions where their end product is one that causes harm to ourselves or other people. But the fact that someone has the bias does not make them stupid.</p>

			 <p>In &ldquo;products I&rsquo;m really not sure need to exist&rdquo; news, a company called <a href="https://reviver.com/">Reviver</a> will sell  you an app-enabled digital number plate for your car, if you live in one of the very few US states where it&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>It seems to be yet another way companies have found to add ongoing subscriptions to your driving experience - I may return to this topic soon. In return for your $20-25 a month, it enables such unmissable features as being able to switch your number plate into dark mode and displaying a tiny app-controlled banner under the plate; essentially a microtweet for anyone driving way too close to you I guess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One feature that I can actually see some potential use for is that it contains enough tracking technology that you can see the location of your car by using the accompanying app.</p>
<p>The problem is that until recently it wasn&rsquo;t just you and Reviver that could see where you are. Security researchers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxn9vx/researchers-track-reviver-digital-license-plate-gps-location">managed to find a way</a> to alter their own user account so that they could see the live location of every vehicle who had one of these number plates. And <a href="https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry/">a lot more</a> besides:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Track the physical GPS location and manage the license plate for all Reviver customers (e.g. changing the slogan at the bottom of the license plate to arbitrary text)</li>
<li>Update any vehicle status to “STOLEN” which updates the license plate and informs authorities</li>
<li>Access all user records, including what vehicles people owned, their physical address, phone number, and email address</li>
<li>Access the fleet management functionality for any company, locate and manage all vehicles in a fleet</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That vulnerability has been fixed now. But it&rsquo;s events like this that make me wonder whether it&rsquo;s really necessary to put app connections and internet-connected surveillance technology in <em>absolutely everything</em> a product designer can dream up, even if it&rsquo;s possible to imagine the odd use for it.</p>

			 <p>Played <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a> 🎮.</p>
<p>This is a turn-based strategy game in which you control mech pilots to save the world from alien invasion. Not the most original storyline and by it&rsquo;s look I first assumed it was akin to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM">XCOM series</a>. But it&rsquo;s not really, because here you know exactly what your enemies are going to do in advance, with no guessing or random luck involved. In some ways it felt more like a puzzle game.</p>
<p>If you lose you get sent back to the beginning to try again. Often I find that style of &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a>&rdquo; game frustratingly repetitive. But here the missions differ a bit each playthrough. You also have the ability to upgrade your mechs in different ways and  unlock lots of new characters so it doesn&rsquo;t get boring. You get the chance to send one of your heroes back through time which gives me the sense of not having lost all my progress (when I remember to do it).</p>
<p>Each fight takes place within small land grid and only takes a few minutes to play, making it well suited to mobile devices, although it&rsquo;s available on all sorts of platforms. It won a lot of awards in past years, deservedly so. And if you&rsquo;re a Netflix subscriber you can <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/22/im-one-of.html">play it for free</a>.</p>

			 <p>Microsoft has created <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111">a language model called &ldquo;Vall-E&rdquo;</a> that can simulate a person&rsquo;s voice saying whatever they choose with the only input needed from the person being 3 second clip of the actual person saying something. I guess a fraction of a TikTok video would do the job.</p>
<p>It can even preserve emotion - so if you have a 3 second clip of your friend angrily shouting about something then they could in theory make a clip of your friend angrily shouting about something completely different.</p>
<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t think you can play with the model yourself. Some people might feel that&rsquo;s in some ways for the best , until society has figured out some idea of how we&rsquo;re going to deal with the sheer amount of future &ldquo;recordings&rdquo; of things that never happened that everyone is going to be able to produce with minimal effort using with tools like this and the various other generative AI type tools that are already out there.</p>
<p>But I imagine someone else will release a more public tool all too soon. It didn&rsquo;t take long for folk to figure out how to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgygy4/stable-diffusion-stability-ai-nsfw-ai-generated-porn">get AI tools to generate images</a> that are really rather against what most of the systems designers involved wanted them to do.</p>
<p>In the mean time you can hear some Vall-E samples on <a href="https://valle-demo.github.io/">this page</a>. Scroll down a bit and compare the &ldquo;Speaker Prompts&rdquo; - which are the 3 second actual recordings of someone&rsquo;s voice they fed it - with the &ldquo;VALL-E&rdquo; output, which is what the model produced based on it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2023/01/10/coming-soon-the.html">Coming soon: the first mainstream UK TV show based on deepfakes</a></h1>

			 <p>Prepare yourself for the <a href="https://www.itv.com/">ITV</a> sketch show &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">Deep Fake Neighbour Wars</a>&rdquo;, the first mainstream UK TV show based on deepfake technology (as far as I know).</p>
<p>Appearing on ITVX on the 26th January, it&rsquo;s a comedy sketch show seemingly showing people living their everyday mundane lives. Except these aren&rsquo;t either characters created for the show or actors doing impressions of other people. They are &lsquo;real&rsquo; megastar celebrities - well, real in the sense that they look and and sound like them, even though the celebrities concerned haven&rsquo;t been anywhere near it.</p>
<p>Instead, the show was first acted out by less well-known actors. <a href="https://studioneural.ai/">StudioNeural</a> - &ldquo;the world’s first provider of synthetic media for long form TV&rdquo; -  then used deepfake technology to replace their faces with ultra-realistic visages of actual bigtime celebrities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From a <a href="https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/fyi/104/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-preview/">summary of the preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We meet loved up Nicki Minaj and Tom Holland who are not happy with Mark Zuckerberg next door, Idris Elba gets a shock when new neighbour Kim Kardashian starts making her presence known in their communal garden, Harry Kane&rsquo;s perfect patio is damaged by upstairs neighbour Stormzy and dental hygienist Billie Eilish clashes with neighbour Beyonce when she starts working from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainstreaming deep fake technology for entertainment like this does feel like a potential turning point for popularizing this technology. It&rsquo;ll allow things to be done that never otherwise could have been. Up until now deepfakes have usually been discussed as in the context of nefarious use-cases -  fake news, fraudulent political persuasion, personal attacks or revenge porn. But even for entirely benign uses, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/09/deep-fake-neighbour-wars-interview-itvx-comedy">the Guardian notes</a>, there&rsquo;s not really much in the way of established etiquette or guidelines for the use of this very new technology yet.</p>
<p>What is fair in the name of comedy, vs what is some kind of unethical exploitation? Whether this be of the celebrities or the relatively nameless actors who are hidden behind the fakes (until the end of the show anyway in this particular case).</p>
<p>Unless a message is constantly superimposed over the broadcast that this isn&rsquo;t real, what are the implications in a world where it&rsquo;s extremely common for short clips to be taken out of videos and shared on social media?</p>
<p>To borrow an example from the same article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_Image">Spitting Image</a> was an extremely funny satire (the original one at least), but how would it have come across if instead of using caricature puppets the show used representations of the people being satirised that were basically indistinguishable from their actual IRL selves?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Dorries">Nadine Dorries</a>, admittedly someone who one might argue has a strong agenda of her own, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-11222675/NADINE-DORRIES-England-fake-cruel-know-Prime-Ministers-dreams.html">was worried </a>that the <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/this-england">This England</a> TV drama which purports to document a dramatised version of how the UK government dealing with Covid-19 (amongst other things) was dangerous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, the producers put a disclaimer before each episode, stating that the drama is fictional, based on true events. But the fact that scenes are interspersed with real news footage makes it very deceptive. Also, many scenes involving politicians and civil servants are eerily convincing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much more convincing would it have been if Boris Johnson was played by his digital doppelganger as opposed to Kenneth Branagh?</p>

			 <p>📺 Watched <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/the-traitors-2022/seasons/1">season 1 of The Traitors</a>.</p>
<p>A reality show where by day a group of strangers complete missions to build up a prize pot, and by night they viciously accuse each other of treachery in order to eject them from the show entirely.</p>
<p>Which is fair enough, because a few of them are in fact traitors. Claudia Winkelman secretly assigned them that role at the start. The viewer knows who they are, the participants do not. They have to figure it out by whatever means they can. Each night they must vote out the person they collectively believe is most traitorous. Of course, to maintain their subterfuge the traitors also have to pretend that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing too and put their public votes in too.</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; vote out all the traitors then they share the prize pot. But if even one traitor remains by the end of the series then the surviving traitors get it all.</p>
<p>Each night whilst the others sleep the anonymous traitors also get to metaphorically kill one of the contestants, kicking them off the show without the ability to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Honestly, it feels a little grim and exploitative to watch. I really hope there&rsquo;s a pile of expert psychologists behind the scenes to help the players cope with the virulent suspicion, deception, mistrust, arguments, paranoia, confrontations and the rest of it.</p>
<p>But watching the participants - the genuinely legit and the traitors trying to appear as such - try to figure out who the traitors are provides incredible examples of all sorts of cognitive biases - confirmation bias, the halo effect, salience bias, a kind of pareidolia, overconfidence, the gambler&rsquo;s fallacy and a ton of herd instinct to name but a few. And all this at the same time as  being put into an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a fascinating example of all these psychological processes going on, some that we can probably recognise very well in ourselves if we stop and think about it for a minute in between screaming at the TV, that it turns out to be compulsive viewing. Even if it&rsquo;s probably not exactly great for most of the folk involved.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/07/revealed-nhs-trusts-tell-patients-they-can-go-private-and-jump-hospital-queues">Today&rsquo;s Observer</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NHS trusts with record waiting lists are promoting “quick and easy” private healthcare services at their own hospitals, offering patients the chance to jump year-long queues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, whilst not a new thing, does not feel good in the midst of a growing NHS crisis, particularly if it&rsquo;s on the rise. The private services that are provided  - whether a £300 MRI scan or a £10,000 hip replacement - supposedly don&rsquo;t impact the services the NHS provides under its public funding. But they often take place in the same premises with the same staff that you would get if you made it to the top of the public waiting list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some technicality that allows them to say it&rsquo;s not sucking resources from our still much loved public health system. But, simplistically, at the end of the day it surely is potential life-or-death British medical capacity that is exclusively available to the rich rather than the person that needs it the most.</p>
<p>The ideal of course would be that the NHS working conditions and funding was improved such that there was no incentive for hospitals or medical staff to operate a private practice at all. For now though, we&rsquo;ll have to decide whether to laugh or cry at the <a href="https://www.theshalbourne.co.uk/about/why-choose-us/">Shalborune Private Health Care website&rsquo;s claim</a> that &ldquo;We believe quality healthcare should be readily accessible.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been the longest contest for the position since 1859, <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2023/01/05/from-the-nyt.html">preventing any of the real business of the House taking place</a> whilst the battle continued.</p>
<p>But if it felt like a long time, it was certainly no 1855. That contest <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64178794">stretched on for two whole months</a> and required 133 ballots to take place before a speaker was selected.</p>
<p>In the end they temporarily changed the rules so as to accept a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">plurality of votes</a> as opposed to the standard absolute majority rules that require the victor to have gotten the support of at least half of the voters. This allowed Nathaniel Banks won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections">the contest</a> with 103 votes from a possible 214 electors.</p>
<p>The repeated election attempts over the past few days apparently became so tedious that the representatives elect started <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-mayhem-during-kevin-mccarthys-14th-bid-for-house-speaker-2023-1">bringing in</a> comics, books, iPad games and their own children in order to keep themselves entertained.

<p>Starting to get into the years I actually remember something about now. I love this as a way of accidentally learning the country&rsquo;s history. The only problem is it seems a lot of it isn&rsquo;t true. John Major seems to be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11319595/Boycott-hurtful-TV-Crown-say-Kings-friends-Furious-John-Major-condemns-Netflix-drama.html">particularly annoyed</a> at it.</p>
<p>The show does admit to being fiction. But not knowing which bits are true makes it hard to know what to take from it. Though an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/12/crown-netflix-fact-fiction/617278/">article in the Atlantic</a> is probably right to conclude that &ldquo;the show is so popular that its interpretation of history will become the definitive one for millions of viewers.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b593116d-f948-4757-b2fa-c74adadc8b42">looks into why</a> the UK&rsquo;s NHS is in such a disastrous condition at present. It turns out it&rsquo;s not all that complicated to understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently lots of ill people - a new wave of Covid-19 is once more sweeping the nation, and the flu (amongst other infectious diseases) is also surging. A real <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/30/ambulance-staff-reportedly-urged-to-conserve-oxygen-amid-twindemic">twindemic</a>.</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t have enough hospital beds. This is partly because we haven&rsquo;t built enough capacity in the first place. But also because the lack of anywhere to discharge patients who still need some amount of social care (but not hospital-level care) to means that thousands of people are unnecessarily stuck in hospital.</li>
<li>There are not enough staff. All parts of the workforce have staff shortages. Those that are there are exhausted, demoralized and in recent times are occasionally on strike or leaving for better opportunities elsewhere. To be clear, these problems started way before the current spate of strikes were on the agenda.</li>
<li>There has not been enough investment. This is nothing new, it&rsquo;s been going on for at least a decade. NHS demand is constantly rising at present, so funding needs to rise substantially beyond inflation just to maintain performance. This hasn&rsquo;t happened for at least a decade.  The UK has amongst the lowest healthcare capital spending as % of GDP of it&rsquo;s peer countries, leaving us with fewer beds, MRI scanners, CT scanners and so on. The chart below, also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2154c20-c9d0-4209-9a47-95d114d31f2b">from the FT</a>, may provide a clue as to why.</li>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a widely held belief that younger people tend to start off being politically left-wing (or liberal, socialist, whatever one wants to call the axis). Then, as time goes on and they start to age, they end up with more conservative views and political preferences.</p>
<p>This trend is encapsulated in a maxim whose origin and exact wording <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/24/heart-head/">is much quibbled over</a> but often turns up in this sort of form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man who is not a Liberal at sixteen has no heart; a man who is not a Conservative at sixty has no head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I hope and trust the implied value judgement isn&rsquo;t true, otherwise, sorry, looks like I&rsquo;m just getting stupider as I get older.</p>
<p>But, treating it as purely descriptive of a trend, the idea that people tend to get more conservative when they get older <a href="https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-47910">does usually seem to be true</a>. Of course it isn&rsquo;t necessarily their age that causes these changes; it may be to do with the fact that people&rsquo;s wealth, status, position in life, psychology and so on tends to alter in an on-average predictable way as they get older.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c361e372-769e-45cd-a063-f5c0a7767cf4">John Burn-Murdoch of the FT notes</a> that it&rsquo;s just not happening that way for UK and US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Millennials">millennials</a>.</p>
<p>They started off liberal as other generations did. But now, even though the older ones are now 40+ years old, they&rsquo;re still very liberal, compared to the rest of the population at least.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Why so? Burn-Murdoch hypothesises that this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_effect">cohort effect</a> due to British and US millennials entering adulthood during the aftermath of the financial crisis. They emerge into an economic environment where generating enough wealth to, for example, own a home is often a ludicrous pipe-dream.</p>
<p>The primary UK and US conservative party&rsquo;s respective fixation on culture war topics probably also doesn&rsquo;t help them much. The typical conservative side of the relevant arguments tends to be less attractive to more academically educated folk, and millennials are the best-educated generation at present.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad">Morten Støstad</a> produced <a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad/status/1609140065967509504">some follow-up work</a> that showed that this trend also exists elsewhere, particularly in English-speaking countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand. His <a href="https://twitter.com/MortenStostad/status/1609177462511902724">first chart</a> looks at English speaking countries and shows similar findings to Burn-Murdoch&rsquo;s original graph.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the second though, Støstad finds that in many other non-English-speaking countries, for example  Germany, France, Italy and Spain, the millennials do seem to be behaving &ldquo;as normal&rdquo; and becoming more conservative over time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/30/played-the-the.html">Exit advent calendar</a> was so good we couldn&rsquo;t stop. This one, from the same makers, is a one-session game where you attempt to solve puzzles to free yourself from an ancient Egyptian tomb. It&rsquo;s rated as one of the harder ones, perhaps because you need to figure out what the puzzles even are and which order to solve them in  as well as the puzzle solution itself - but we got there in the end.</p>

<p>We actually ignored the entire premise and completed it over two lengthy sessions. The puzzles were fun and varied, some harder than others but most of them felt very fair.</p>
<p>Something happens towards the end that was one of my favourite ever twists in these kind of games. Even more fun than a chocolate calendar for anyone that likes puzzle escape room kind of things, highly recommended.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/12/28/covid-mrna-vaccines.html">Covid-19 mRNA vaccines are weakly associated with Myopericarditis - but not nearly as much as having Covid-19 is</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/12/28/covid-mrna-vaccines.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-28 16:05:51 &#43;0100">Dec 28, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2798866">A recent paper</a> provides a systematic review of studies on the link between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations and myopericarditis in young people.</p>
<p>They find that there&rsquo;s a low but positive association between the vaccination and later myopericarditis, particularly in males after the second dose of the vaccine. The ovreall rate of developing myopericarditis after vaccination is estimated to be between 0.3 and 5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated people.</p>
<p>But - and this is a huge but - this risk is <em>far lower</em> than the risk of developing the same condition after being infected by Covid-19 itself.</p>
<p>So whilst it&rsquo;s important and true that there is a risk of myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines (and no conspiracy theorists, no-one sensible is covering this up - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-information-for-healthcare-professionals/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-covid-19-vaccination#is-there-an-association-of-myocarditis-or-pericarditis-following-covid-19-vaccination">here</a> for example is the UK government&rsquo;s published advice on this matter) when making our decisions we need to remember that you&rsquo;re more than 3x more likely to get myocarditis if you&rsquo;re infected by Covid as opposed to if you take the vaccine and it prevents you getting Covid.</p>
<p>The authors also find that the severity of outcomes associated with developing myopericarditis was lower if it was associated with having developed after vaccination vs if it had developed following Covid-19.  No-one in any of the surveyed studies</p>
<p>To me, this is all about considering which the correct baselines are for any given decision. Vaccines are not entirely risk free. But given <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/covid-news-anyone-not-caught-it-england_uk_62727dc1e4b0cca6755cc13d">almost everyone in the UK</a> appears to have had Covid-19 at some point and it continues to circulate nearly 2 years later, it is usually more sensible for the average person not literally living in a bubble to compare the risks associated with the vaccine to the risks associated with getting Covid, rather than some fantasy lifestyle where there is no risk to <em>not</em> having the vaccine.</p>
<p>In summary: I believe this study suggests taking the vaccine makes it more than 3x less likely you&rsquo;d suffer myopericarditis if you got the vaccine as opposed to getting Covid. Furthermore if you do contract it post-vaccination, it&rsquo;s less likely to be severe than if it followed Covid. However it is slightly more likely that you&rsquo;d develop it than if you went through life having never had either the vaccine or Covid-19.</p>

			 <p>Incoming disillusionment for anyone who somehow managed to convince themselves that when the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-taliban-safety-women-girls-afghanistan">US, UK et al asked the Taliban</a> to please guarantee the protection of women after they <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0b34ccc-845c-4f94-8093-caf40a710000">chaotically withdrew their troops</a> that it would actually mean something. The Taliban administration said yes, sure, of course, we&rsquo;ll respect women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>In reality, so far the women of Afghanistan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-education-taliban-7583cf97e3d96e0d07cd7674c3b5a3c3">have been banned</a> from attending middle school, high school, universities or certain types of religious classes. They&rsquo;re also prohibited from most forms of employment. They can&rsquo;t visit parks or gyms, and are obligated to wear full-coverage clothing in other public areas. There&rsquo;s a concern this is a dismal journey towards even more absolute rights-stripping, such that Afghan women may soon be prohibited from leaving their homes more generally.</p>

			 <p>One of the drivers of the huge number of strikes the UK <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/12/05/an-understandable-epidemic.html">is currently in the midst of</a> is that many employers are not offering annual pay rises that allow for a wage it&rsquo;s possible to live a decent life on, let alone keep up spending parity with last year. Pay is not the only reason for the strikes by a long stretch, but it is a key one for many strikes.</p>
<p>One argument the government often respond to the public service sector strikers' pay demands with is &ldquo;Hey, we don&rsquo;t set the wages, we just do what the independent Pay Review boards tell us to do. Blame them!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The role of Pay Review Boards is to give advice to the government on pay for certain public sector workers. They cover <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/public-sector-pay">about 45%</a> of all public sector staff. The boards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Armed forces’ pay review body (AFPRB) </li>
<li>National Crime Agency remuneration review body (NCARRB)</li>
<li>NHS pay review body (NHSPRB)</li>
<li>Police remuneration review body (PRRB) </li>
<li>Prison service pay review body (PSPRB)</li>
<li>Review body on doctors’ and dentists’ remuneration (DDRB)</li>
<li>Review body on senior salaries (SSRB)</li>
<li>School teachers’ review body (STRB) </li>
</ul>
<p>One immediate critique of the government&rsquo;s claim that any disagreement is all the Pay Review Board&rsquo;s fault is that governments don&rsquo;t actually have to implement the board&rsquo;s recommendations. Their output is advice that in theory the government can do what it likes with.</p>
<p>Whilst the norm is to follow the advice, it&rsquo;s easy to find examples of where they haven&rsquo;t. For instance the latest advice from the Prison Service Pay Review Body and Senior Salaries Review Body were <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/pay-review-bodies">only partially accepted</a>. The Government has the final say so could alter the parameters if it wanted to.</p>
<p>But perhaps more problematic is that the government can exert a lot of influence over what the advice is going to be in the first place, to a level I wasn&rsquo;t really aware of until recently.</p>
<p>For a start it&rsquo;s the government who appoints each of the board members in the first place, with the Prime Minister being responsible for appointing the chair. But we don&rsquo;t need to get into the realms of the personal to see how constrained the boards are.</p>
<p>Each year the relevant government minister sends a remit to the board concerned, alongside their the pay changes the government already decided it wants to make.  The remit tells the board which factors they should focus on when making their decisions alongside any constraints that the government <em>has already decided to enforce</em> that they must bear in mind.</p>
<p>Sometimes the constraints are such that they exclude many of decisions the board in theory could make.</p>
<p>For instance, between 2013 and 2017 the public sector pay growth was limited to an average of 1%. The constraint was imposed by the government, not the pay review board. In situations like these the boards can only give advice on <em>how</em> to distribute that 1%.</p>
<p>Likewise during 2021-2022 there was a general public sector pay freeze ordered by the government for most public sector employees. The pay review boards could then only give advice on how to implement rises for types of workers the government had decided were eligible.</p>
<p>This year the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024/nhs-pay-review-body-remit-letter-2023-to-2024-pay-round">NHS remit letter</a> tells the board that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the NHS budget has already been set until 2024 to 2025. Pay awards must strike a careful balance – recognising the vital importance of public sector workers while delivering value for the taxpayer, considering private sector pay levels, not increasing the country’s debt further, and being careful not to drive prices even higher in the future.</p>
<p>In the current economic context, it is particularly important that you also have regard to the government’s inflation target when forming recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the board is constrained to giving advice that if enacted wouldn&rsquo;t increase the amount of budget the NHS would need to fulfill it. They&rsquo;d also probably want to avoid using up enough of the pre-decided budget such that another aspect of the investment-starved service would suffer even more than it already is. The latter is something that can easily happen - there are many reports of, for example, the pressure schools are under to give their staff pay rises the government agreed to, but with the government failing to actually providing the extra budget needed to enact the raise. Thus some other critical part of the educational experience in this case must suffer.</p>
<p>The NHS remit letter this year also tells the board to ensure that their advice somehow focuses on the inflation target that the government set, rather than, say, what&rsquo;s necessary for a happy, efficient, effective workforce.</p>
<p>This feels entirely backwards to me, and sometimes potentially impossible. How does one take the government&rsquo;s inflation target into consideration at the same time as considering private sector pay levels,  when the private sector is not constrained to take any note at all of the government&rsquo;s inflation target in making its pay awards?</p>
<p>Naively, I had expected that the pay review board created its recommendations based on the need to recruit, retain and engage employees in the domain that they&rsquo;re responsible for. They&rsquo;d ensure that the employees have enough income to live a reasonable life, and ideally have pay roughly comparable to other similar job opportunities out there. Except of course if we&rsquo;re  particularly desperate to recruit and retain some roles (which we are - we&rsquo;re desperate for nurses and teachers amongst others), in which case perhaps the pay or conditions would have to be improved to reflect that.</p>
<p>In this fantasy world, the board&rsquo;s recommendations would then give input to the government to help them to figure out what budget they need to provide in order to fulfill the pay recommendations, in addition to any other investments or costs the service in question needs outside of the domain of the Pay Review Board. But in reality it looks to be more the other way around. The government can pre-set the budget and enforce constraints of its own choosing. The boards seem to be more advising on how to implement the government&rsquo;s existing plans rather than enabled to provide an independent opinion as to what those plans should be in the first place.</p>

			 <p>The recent <a href="https://www.qatar2022.qa/">Qatar World Cup</a> final was apparently one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/18/world-cup-final-argentina-france-match-report">best ever matches</a> to grace the competition, although sadly I forgot it was even on.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the surrounding setup was anything other than a moral disaster.</p>
<p>Described by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/19/the-winner-is-qatar-project-hard-football-power-world-cup-2022">the Guardian&rsquo;s Barney Ronay</a> as &lsquo;the most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport&rsquo;, the honour of hosting it was granted to an authoritarian government that routinely enables the abuse of human rights.</p>
<p>There are essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar">no LGBT rights</a> in Qatar, with prison sentences handed out for engaging in &ldquo;homosexual practices&rdquo;. Even <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/24/qatar-security-forces-arrest-abuse-lgbt-people">just existing</a> can lead to imprisonment, beating and harassment from the security forces. Anti LGBT legislation was followed to the almost-comical-if-it-wasn&rsquo;t-real extent that <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1707227/Qatar-officials-slammed-crazy-rainbow-flag-ban-gay-player-World-Cup-news">you weren&rsquo;t allowed to wear</a> rainbow coloured clothes to the match.</p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s multiple new stadiums and surrounding infrastructure were built in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022">literally deadly</a> workplace conditions involving <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/qatar-world-cup-labor-modern-slavery-new-report_n_636d2e72e4b03438614132ba">near slavery</a> in many instances.</p>
<p>The environmental damage is also likely to be <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-cup-in-qatar-is-a-climate-catastrophe/">absurdly huge</a>, despite the incredible amount of greenwashing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly upsetting to reflect on the point that perhaps all this isn&rsquo;t a weird aberration. The fact Qatar was selected as the host made the associated horror show particularly visible and disturbing. But, unfortunately, abusing desperate humans alongside the climate that sustains us all in order to put on a massively profitable and image-enhancing show is far more universal than that.</p>

			 <p>One idea that has been circling around my head a lot recently is how we commonly treat the recent &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; of mental illness as something specifically pertaining to the individual sufferers concerned. We&rsquo;re often inclined, however compassionately, to attributing their suffering to their personal &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; biology, their brain chemistry or their thinking patterns. We don&rsquo;t step back and look at the potentially larger scale social and political causes of it.</p>
<p>In the book <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781785924798?title=Life+Isn%27t+Binary&amp;author=Alex+Iantaffi&amp;cover_id=32801">Life Isn&rsquo;t Binary</a>, Barker and Iantaffi provide a phrasing of this issue that has stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps we would do well to view the depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles that most of us grapple with at some point as a sane response to an insane world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pain and struggles are entirely real, there&rsquo;s no questioning of that. But in many cases they&rsquo;re also understandable without recourse to individual &ldquo;abnormalities&rdquo;. They have causes; logical, rational and predictable antecedents.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they may in fact be the result of the body and brain working perfectly normally given the situation they find themselves in. In <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781632868312?title=Lost+Connections&amp;author=Johann+Hari&amp;cover_id=32781">Lost Connections</a>, Hari notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved responses to dangers that may not be &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for today&rsquo;s challenges in many cases. But the fact that people have those responses is necessarily not a sign of bad or unusual health. They&rsquo;re a perfectly normal response to situations that are perceived to pose some kind of threat.</p>
<p>In some instances the threats may not be real but rather the result of some misunderstanding. In these cases perhaps a valid avenue of treatment might be to try and help someone change how they think about a situation. But on other occasions times the perceived threat may in fact be very real.</p>
<p>As is obvious from the above, this kind of issue has been touched upon to some extent by several books and articles I&rsquo;ve read in recent times. But it&rsquo;s not clear to me that it&rsquo;s reached the point of full acceptance, or that the conclusions that logically follow from this train of thinking have been concretely transformed into policy, perhaps outside of a few trials.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily through the very real historical lack of compassion and understanding that has confronted those afflicted with mental health issues. In fact, some of the resistance to this idea might be the concern that taking this view too far to the extremes could result in the ignoring of people&rsquo;s very individual needs, or a failure to provide the individual-level treatments are in fact needed in some cases.</p>
<p>A quote I saw somewhere taken from a psychotherapist called D. W. Winnicott&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Human Nature&rsquo;, which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capacity to become depressed&hellip;is something that is not inborn nor is it an illness; it comes as an achievement of healthy emotional growth&hellip;the fact is that life itself is difficult. Probably the greatest suffering in the human world is the suffering of normal or healthy or mature persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that at least the first part of that must be true. No-one that I&rsquo;m aware of thinks that their own life is entirely easy, uncomplicated and stress-free. But it&rsquo;s often hard for us to viscerally remember that fact when it comes to understanding and interacting with other people. This is especially the case if we feel like someone mistreated us, that they&rsquo;re of &ldquo;bad character&rdquo; (whatever that means) or that they&rsquo;re somehow getting a better deal out of life than us. Even at the extremes, is there really any reason to believe that the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is presently living a happy and care-free life  (actually maybe he&rsquo;s only <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/07/business/elon-musk-wealth/index.html">second richest</a> now)?</p>
<p>If we accept that most, possibly all, people feel that their life is in some way a struggle then wouldn&rsquo;t we find it strange if they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> ever have any kind of negative psychological response? That might feel like a disorder in itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the controversy from the compassionate side might be a fear that, in understanding that it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have the capacity to suffer from what we now classify as mental illness one, could misguidedly come to the conclusion that, hey, we just need to live with it. Sure you&rsquo;re suffering, maybe a lot more than most people -  but it&rsquo;s a perfect normal phenomenon. You don&rsquo;t need treatment. There&rsquo;s nothing we should or even could do about it. That would be entirely the wrong conclusion to draw.</p>
<p>But very little of import in this discussion is the result of a unmodifiable natural law. Societies have changed over time.</p>
<p>By many metrics they tend to improve in many ways - this famously being a core thesis of books like Pinker&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141034645">The Better Angels of our Nature</a>&rdquo; as well as his more recent work. It does seem to me that it&rsquo;s very often a fallacy to think &ldquo;things must have been better in every way a few decades ago&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we lived a life more like someone in the past would have then we&rsquo;d be guaranteed happiness&rdquo;.   But even if the direction <em>has</em> generally been positive in the past, then there&rsquo;s no guarantee it always will be. Besides, there will always be hiccups, mis-steps and temporary deviations into potential despair along the way.</p>
<p>But the fact that there have been changes in the past show us that there can be changes in the future. I often wonder what people 200 years from now will look back on us and think &ldquo;oh man, that&rsquo;s wild that they used to do that. How could they possibly believe <em>that</em> was OK?&rdquo; about in the same way that we might look back on people from past centuries, wondering how they could ever believe what they needed to believe in order behave in ways that by today&rsquo;s standards we would consider illogical, foolish, and cruel.</p>
<p>But another bad conclusion one can draw, this time from <em>not</em> taking social or other macro causes of mental distress into account, comes from the idea that those who get diagnosed as depressed, anxious and so on are the unhappy victims of random bad brain chemistry or invalid patters of thought. This idea might lead people to infer that the individual medicalisation of patients is a necessary <em>and sufficient</em> manner of addressing their pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely not against the use of pharmaceuticals or other individual-level medical therapies of any helpful kind. Sometimes their usage may be imperative, urgent, and life saving. But in the cases where there is a plausible social or environmental cause for the condition - let&rsquo;s say abject loneliness, poverty-induced fear and exhaustion, anxiety resulting from racial abuse, the legacy of past traumas, all those kind of things - giving someone individual medical &ldquo;brain treatment&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t do anything about removing the cause. The same cause that likely wrecks the life of many other people in addition to the one who summoned up the strength to visit a doctor and had the access to do so.</p>
<p>Most damningly, limiting ourselves to individually medicalising the sufferers of a structural effect lets us off the hook from even addressing the causes. Often this is convenient, in the sense that truly addressing some structural or social determinants of disease may involve solutions that are politically challenging to even discuss in the current environment, let alone carry out.</p>
<p>As just one example of what we know could be done, at one point in the Covid-19 pandemic the UK made a concerted and effective effort to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; homelessness. Being without accommodation is a life situation which is <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/ending-homelessness/health-and-wellbeing/mental-health/">highly associated</a> with the suffering of mental health disorders, both as cause and effect. But with this initiative, street homelessness <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/mar/opinion-five-lessons-pandemic-taught-us-about-ending-homelessness-permanently">was apparently almost eliminated </a>and tens of thousands of people were moved from emergency to longer term accommodation.</p>
<p>It seems like in general the policy worked! However the Government chose to <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/the-numbers-streets-going-rocket-18254318">end the scheme</a>. Last year a quarter of the beneficiaries of the scheme are <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/1_in_4_people_helped_off_the_streets_under_the_governments_everyone_in_scheme_are_no_longer_being_accommodated_">back to having no accommodation</a> It&rsquo;s feared that the 2022 cost of living crisis will cause a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis">tidal wave</a>&rdquo; of new homelessness, and given the <a href="https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society">acknowledged connection</a> between homelessness and mental illness, an unnecessary spike in mental suffering.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/opinion/us-mental-health-politics.html">New York Times opinion article</a> provided the following metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If something about some people&rsquo;s lives today is causing them mental anguish, then we certainly need to treat that suffering. But a solution that doesn&rsquo;t also stop the metaphorical guy who is mowing down their well-being is never going to be sustainable, complete or robust.</p>
<p>Therapising someone who&rsquo;s anxiety is exacerbated by for instance food insecurity, who knows that the only way they can afford to eat even low-quality unhealthful food is dependent on them keeping their low-paid, precarious and abusive job, may potentially help their inner state in the short term. But it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to remove the actual, real, threat of them in truth  not being able live without exposing themselves to abusive conditions - conditions that they don&rsquo;t have any agency over;  however unpleasant the job is, it might taken away from them at someone else&rsquo;s whim. Someone who didn&rsquo;t respond to those prospects with a substantial level of at least worry and trepidation would seem unusual to me.</p>
<p>If their response is damaging to their own quality of life then they surely must be individually helped. But we must also address whatever has led us to a place where their ability to lead a fulfilling life depends on your luck and ability to take employment at any personal cost. What led us to a place where more than 1 in 5 millennials <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness">feel like they have no friends</a>? A society where financial security depends in part <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/">upon your race</a>? That those who live in some areas <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1492">die many years earlier</a> than those that live elsewhere, even in a small and rich country? A land where the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on you <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/22/those-with-the-least-have-suffered-the-most-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">were more severe if you were already poorer beforehand</a>?</p>
<p>This becomes even clearer to me when we look at patterns of mental health issues. These sorts of statistics are always a little hard to interpret because to feature in such a dataset often requires you to have had access to and attended certain types of healthcare. It may even depend the specific medical practitioner you see when you do so.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780143127741?title=The+Body+Keeps+the+Score&amp;author=Bessel+A.+Van+der+Kolk&amp;cover_id=32791">The Body Keeps The Score,</a> the author writes that despite the best attempts of psychiatrists to define and categorise mental illnesses, for example in the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM), specific diagnoses often come down to tallying up a list of symptoms and may depend as much on the mindset of the doctor concerned as on the patient. The fact that new editions of the DSM categorisation come out every so often with new and altered definitions reinforces the point that we haven&rsquo;t fully solved how to categorise mental illness, let alone treat it.</p>
<p>In her book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942">All Our Relations</a>, Tanya Talaga draws a direct line between the incredibly high rate of that most extreme outcome of adverse mental health, suicide, and the social conditions that the Indigenous peoples of countries like Canada and the US find now themselves in.</p>
<p>She reports that in Canada, suicide and self-harm is now the leading cause of death of First Nations people up to the age of 44. Rates are more than 5 times higher than a comparison group of non-Indigenous people for males aged between 15-24.</p>
<p>But this wasn&rsquo;t always the case. The suicide epidemic in those communities is a modern phenomenon, seen only after the introduction of forced resettlement and the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system">Indian Residential schools</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The natural brain biochemistry of these folk didn&rsquo;t suddenly change overnight. No genetic mutation suddenly somehow retrospectively swept their culture. Rather, their way of life, their beliefs, their freedoms, hopes and dreams had been assaulted by the political decisions and resulting social conditions at the time.</p>
<p>Today Indigenous children are more likely to grow up without access to the basic determinants of health, which Talaga lists as including income, status, clean water and air, decent accommodation, supportive families and communities, education, healthcare and a connection to their traditions. The absence of these basics negatively affects their physical, mental and social health.</p>
<p>A related critique of the &ldquo;DSM-5&rdquo; type categorisation approach to mental illness was made by the British Psychological society in <a href="https://dxrevisionwatch.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/dsm-5-2011-bps-response.pdf">their response</a> to the development of the that system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;systems such as this are based on identifying problems as located within individuals.
This misses the relational context of problems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all this I want to remember that it&rsquo;s very likely that some mental illness does have a biochemical, brain or genetic basis that might be directly treatable in more conventional ways. Few people seem to argue against the idea that pharmaceuticals in this sphere do have their uses. They may be necessary even when the underlying cause of an issue isn&rsquo;t due to unusual brain chemistry. But cannot be the be-all and end-all of interventions when the cause of the condition being treated lies outside of the person.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  it may bring comfort to those with particular suffering to have a medicalised label. If nothing else it provides a valuable recognition that those around them can acknowledge, understand and treat. Perhaps a sense that your pain is real, and can be addressed. It may be reassuring in some sense to feel biologically unlucky as opposed to blameworthy. But of course issue there is more about the invalid and illogical misuse of blame concepts.</p>
<p>A categorisation also provides a potential identity that allows them to seek out a peer group of those who face similar battles. This might be beneficial either in terms of learning strategies to tackle the issue directly, or by providing a social group of people with a common interest who you know understand rather than stigmatise you.</p>
<p>Despite my general skepticism about the benefits of social networks, this does seem like one possible use of these technologies, perhaps <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116909/">especially for rarer conditions</a>. In 2016, Naslund et al. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/future-of-mental-health-care-peertopeer-support-and-social-media/DC0FB362B67DF2A48D42D487ED07C783">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A potential downside I can imagine may be risk of the person ending up feeling like &ldquo;they are their illness&rdquo; and that it&rsquo;s a fixed and permanent trait as opposed to something that can often be addressed. It may also be damaging if the idea that those outside the peer group can&rsquo;t help, and perhaps are even not to be trusted is cultivated. But overall, these types of peer groups are likely invaluable - &ldquo;given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks&rdquo;, to quote the Naslund paper.</p>
<p>Whilst I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t get the sense that this way of thinking is particularly routine in healthcare today, there have been a few interventions that do seem to acknowledge the social, political and environmental causes and exacerbations of mental health issues.</p>
<p>Recently the results of a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">National Health Service</a> intervention that involved the prescribing of heating <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63707689">reported success</a>. &ldquo;Prescribing heating&rdquo; simply means paying the home heating bills for patients who cannot afford to do so themselves. This is an increasing number given the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119567595/households-across-the-u-k-are-about-experience-an-80-jump-in-energy-costs"> dramatic increase in energy costs</a> in recent times.</p>
<p>Many illnesses and other reductions in quality of life are caused or exacerbated by living in cold environs.  It&rsquo;s estimated that 10,000 people a year die of cold home related issues. Dealing with the other health consequences of cold homes costs the NHS £860 million a year. Most of the reporting on this trial addresses physical illnesses, such as respiratory or circulatory conditions, rather than mental illnesses, but <a href="https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf">the report that calculated the £860 million figure</a> does note that living in cold or otherwise inadequate homes can also have a severe impact on mental health.</p>
<p>In 2018 we saw a &ldquo;social prescribing&rdquo; initiative that would enable doctors <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/british-doctors-may-soon-prescribe-art-music-dance-singing-lessons-180970750/">to prescribe therapeutic art or hobby based treatments</a> for instance. Related trials so far have shown improvements in patients physical and mental health. This approach is one potential plank of the Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/936725/6.4882_DCMS_Loneliness_Strategy_web_Update_V2.pdf">anti-loneliness strategy</a>.</p>
<p>The NHS notes that social prescribing is effective for a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/">wide range of people</a>, including those who need support with their mental health. The Royal College of Psychiatrists agrees, <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/social-prescribing">reporting</a>) that social prescribing helps people connect to their community in a way that can improve their health, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>Of course, as with almost anything, there&rsquo;s a risk of taking this idea too far. We must avoid people being &ldquo;socially-prescribed&rdquo; to on the basis that it&rsquo;s a simpler or cheaper option than the alternatives (if it is - I don&rsquo;t know).</p>
<p>It will not be a suitable solution for everyone. The Royal College of Psychiatrists notes that it, in isolation, social prescribing will only likely be sufficient treatment <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/position-statements/position-statement-ps01-21---social-prescribing---2021.pdf">for patients with mild mental illnesses</a>. For moderate or severe conditions, more traditional forms of therapy and medication are still usually to be recommended, with social prescribing being considered as an accompaniment if suitable. Social prescribing might potentially also play a role in the prevention of these conditions originating in the first place.</p>
<p>Social prescribing is of course only one intervention that addresses the idea that the way we live is causing many mental health issues.</p>
<p>Many, perhaps most, future interventions may take place outside of the healthcare system. This is particularly the case if we continue to imagine healthcare as being something that you access when you&rsquo;re already ill rather than a service that helps lessens the likelihood of the illness in the first pace.</p>
<p>One example currently outside of the domain of the UK healthcare system - although the line often seems somewhat arbitrary to me - are food banks. Food banks exist to directly address the problem of people going hungry by giving free food parcels to people who are in such a state of destitution that they cannot otherwise obtain food. In the UK these are typically run by charities or NGOs, such the <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/">Trussell Trust,</a> who have stepped up where the state has dramatically and unnecessarily failed its citizenry.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://uploads.strikinglycdn.com/files/dd06f2f2-bea9-46ff-941c-1d8849dce077/Mental%20Health%20Report%20-%20Final%200303.pdf">a report</a> by mental health social worker Tom Pollard, the increasing demand for food banks is driven simply by an increasing number people not having enough income to buy food.  This phenomena is growing dramatically, driven by conscious, visible, political choices such as cuts to social security support, insecure employment practices and rising house costs.  43% of households on Universal Credit benefits experienced food insecurity in 2019-2020.</p>
<p>Intuitively this seems a solvable problem. As the report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not right that people need to rely on charity handouts to get by. Our social security system, at both a local and national level, and our economy, should ensure that everyone is able to afford food and other basics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, the struggle to not starve, the lack of personal agency, the feeling of failure and the cognitive effort required to  jump through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to access these services can come at a great cost to mental health. And all this to typically receive a one-off package containing up to 3 days worth of food - enough to not starve to death right now, but it surely can&rsquo;t do a lot for the person&rsquo;s ongoing peace of mind and ability to live a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>In the words of the Big Issue&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/news/social-justice/heartbreaking-reports-from-food-bank-users-show-mental-health-impact-of-poverty/">writeup of the report</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soaring UK poverty forcing people to use food banks is creating a &lsquo;toxic environment&rsquo; for their mental health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/very-high-numbers-of-foodbank-users-have-mental-health-problems-and-disabilities-report">A third</a> of households relying on these services include someone with mental health problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of foodbanks is stigmatised by some, with potential users reporting feelings of shame, anxiety and embarrassment at the thought of even visiting such an establishment. The film &ldquo;<a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/i-daniel-blake-2016">I, Daniel Blake</a>&rdquo; portrays this kind of situation, and many of the other life-crushing effects of poverty in an effective and harrowing way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/foodbank-users-volunteers-reveal-shame-19155607">There are certainly people</a> who don&rsquo;t seek even this most meagre assistance due to the shame they feel. The same goes for welfare benefits in general, as the recipients of those too are routinely shamed and abused by our elected officials, the media and the public at large.</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/73738/benefits-stigma-means-10bn-goes-unclaimed">polling</a> showed that most claimants feel shame sometimes, most or all of the time, with one in four potential claimants deferring or declining to apply for the assistance they are absolutely entitled to for this reason. Analysis suggested that a ball-park figure of £10-15 billion per year in benefits went unclaimed in 2016. For what it&rsquo;s worth, this is roughly 5-8x the estimate for the value of benefit fraud during the same period, if I read <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664827/fraud-and-error-stats-release-2016-17-final-estimates.pdf">the Government report</a> correctly.</p>
<p>As it stands, <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/universal-credit-mental-health/">one study</a> found an association between how many people are claiming benefits in an area and the amount of prescriptions for anti-depressants. For every 1% increase in people in a Local Authority area claiming Universal Credit there was a 5.6% increase in anti-depressants.</p>
<p>With all these type of associative studies, the direction of causality is usually not clear. Does having mental health problems make you more likely to need to claim benefits? Or does the experience of claiming benefits and the limits of the life you can live on them lead to mental health problems? My assumption is that both are true to some extent, although I haven&rsquo;t looked much into work in this area.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://covidrealities.org/">Covid Realities project</a> did however find instances of people describing the latter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;parents and carers living on a low-income reported experiences of stress, anxiety and low mood associated with claiming Universal Credit, connected to financial insecurity and the overall inadequacy of payments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, there is clearly a set of people that both have distressing mental health conditions and live in poverty. Solving the latter is a moral imperative in its own right, and the direction of evidence would suggest that doing so would likely &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; improve the former.</p>
<p>For those that are able to claim Universal Credit, the Government increased the amount of some entitlements by £20 in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. This was presumably intended to assist with the increased financial pressure on those that already received benefits, and also those that the pandemic would end up forcing into the position of requiring them. After a year of Covid-19 raging the number of Universal Credit claimants had nearly doubled, up to 6 million recipients.</p>
<p>This £20 boost was well-received by anti-poverty campaigners.  However in October 2021, despite the pandemic very much still being with us and inflation making the cost of living ever more unbearable for the non-wealthy, the Government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58812609">chose to abolish</a> even that £20 increase.</p>
<p>Many experts and campaign groups pleaded with them to not go ahead with that cut, including <a href="https://mentalhealth-uk.org/">Mental Health UK</a>, who <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/universal-credit-cut-sees-catastrophic-21695217">highlighted the dangerous loop effect</a> between mental health and poverty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not just a financial issue; we’re very concerned these pressures will result in more people seeing their mental health problems spiral, in turn making it difficult to manage their money worries and sending them deeper into the red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/">British Psychological Society</a> had similar concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This decision will see health inequalities widen, placing more pressure on our already stretched and underfunded public services, as well as intensifying the mental health difficulties of people already struggling with rising debts, reduced income and soaring living costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, the Government went ahead with the cut, forcing people&rsquo;s lives into trajectories likely to cause or exacerbate mental illness. This was a political choice to knowingly create an environment that endangered mental health. Sure, some of the fallout symptomology might be treatable with medication (which comes with its own costs, financial and otherwise). But the suffering may never have occurred in the first place had we not consciously changed our societal environment in such a way.</p>
<p>There are clearly numerous other ways we might think about enabling poorer people access to money, unhoused people to accommodation, lonely people to socialisation, hungry people to food, exploited workers to quality jobs, people who suffer prejudice to equity, people with disabilities to a full and happy life and so on. Many of these might be much more creative and affirming than simply providing food and income enough to live a tolerable life to those who need it - although doing that might well be a good, necessary and urgent first step given the dire situation we currently find ourselves in.</p>
<p>But however we choose to address the subject, whilst taking care not to remove or reduce access to conventional medical therapies to those that need them, putting the foundations in place to solve the structural issues that in part cause the need in the first place is surely the sane response to an insane state of affairs.</p>

			 <p>Finished playing <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc-anniversary-edition">Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc</a> 🎮.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A visual novel style game where you&rsquo;re trapped in a school under the purview of a tyrannical teddy bear. He&rsquo;s happy to let you &ldquo;graduate&rdquo;, but only if you first murder one of your friends in such a way that the rest never suspect you. And nobody wants to do something like that, right?</p>
<p>The main action consists of a series of trials whereupon you need to destroy the testimony of your friends/rivals by literally firing &ldquo;truth bullets&rdquo; at their invalid statements, in between a few somewhat inexplicable bouts of hangman and rhythm games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havoc&rdquo; is a good subtitle for it; it&rsquo;s pretty insane and chaotic. But the story is gripping and addictive. The twists and turns you learn throughout the trials are high-tier detective drama-like at times. If you are OK with a lot of reading, and some high-school drama, it comes highly recommended, albeit with one caveat.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc-anniversary-edition">others have noted</a>, it includes plenty of aspects that these days might be considered crass or problematic - enough to make me inwardly cringe now and then - so buyer beware. It&rsquo;s definitely not one for children.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/">UK Statistics Authority</a> has once again been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/12/watchdog-reprimands-tories-over-800bn-post-brexit-trade-deals-claim">forced to reprimand</a> the Conservative party for making false claims with data.</p>
<p>This time we&rsquo;d seen Michael Gove <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/1587812825304645635">claiming</a> that the UK had gotten over £800 billion worth of new trade since 2016 due to securing new free trade deals post-Brexit.</p>
<p>The thing is the £800 billion figure <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/post-Brexit-trade-deals-Gove/">reflects <em>total</em> trade</a> with these countries since 2016, not new trade. And for the vast majority of countries concerned the equivalent of these trade deals existed long before 2016; the terms and conditions were just <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842">rolled over</a> post-Brexit, making it entirely misleading to imply that they caused new trade.</p>
<p>Even were this not to be the case, one cannot attribute all trade with a country to having a free trade agreement with them. As a country, the US is one of the UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/october2022">top trade partners</a> by value, despite us <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-admits-us-trade-deal-out-of-reach/">being nowhere near close</a> to forming a free trade agreement with them.</p>

These are sites whereby to access the content you can choose to either have your behaviour tracked by the site or alternatively you can pay money to use the site without being tracked.</p>
<p>Given how much <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/gdpr-cookie-consent-eprivacy">everyone hates</a> the EU cookie popups  I don&rsquo;t think introducing more such barriers before being able to access a site going to cause much delight.</p>
<p>Although I guess I do like that it makes explicit firstly that you&rsquo;re being tracked - which you probably are being on most other major sites anyway, and the vast majority are not so clear on that. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/03/11/google-is-tracking-you-on-86-of-the-top-50000-websites-on-the-planet/">One study</a> from 2020 suggested that Google alone is tracking website visitors on 86% of the top 50,000 website. And secondly that the data being silently collected from you has some monetary value. A cookie paywall gives you the choice of how you want the website to extract value from you - pay with money or pay with data.</p>
<p>I was also interested to learn the amount typically charged for opting out of such tracking at present. In the examples the paper surveyed it ranged between 2.99 and 6.25 euros per month. Honestly I can&rsquo;t see all that many people taking the imposition and <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/blacklight-tracking-advertisers-digital-privacy-sensitive-websites">risks</a> of being tracked seriously enough to pay that kind of amount, particularly if it&rsquo;s something you have to set up on each individual website you visit. It&rsquo;s also hard for me to imagine that most people&rsquo;s behaviour data on most sites is truly &ldquo;worth&rdquo; 75 euros a year.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m slightly amused that the AI-driven <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">chatGPT chat bot</a> has been <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaem/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt-for-constantly-giving-wrong-answers">banned</a> from being used to write <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> answers.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, StackOverflow is a web forum where programmer and programmer-adjacent nerds like me ask questions about how to do various technical tasks so we look like we&rsquo;re extremely proficient in our jobs.</p>
<p>chatGPT responses are prohibited on the basis that it sometimes produces answers that are surface-level plausible but in fact wrong. The problem is that it would take a human with expertise to know that the answers are wrong. Or &ldquo;fluent bullshit&rdquo; to quote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23493932/chatgpt-ai-generated-answers-temporarily-banned-stack-overflow-llms-dangers">a Verge article</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;d observe that humans on the internet are <em>extremely</em> not immune from producing reams of fluent bullshit, so perhaps it&rsquo;s just a bad habit it picked up from us.</p>
<p>Other than that, chatGPT is a pretty incredible seeming system at first glance. You can sign up to try it for free <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">here</a> at present, which is well worth doing if you have even a slight interest. As it happens it has actually given me some useful answers to technical questions, as well as a lot of facility for wasting time.</p>

The latest Machine Gun Kelly brings back those vibes big time.</p>
<p>Something about it would make me cringe if I was to find out it&rsquo;s intended as entirely sincere rather than a slightly tongue-in-check callback to those times. But that aside, I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying it as a retro listen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The UK is currently experiencing a whole lot of strikes. There&rsquo;s at least one a day <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11494349/The-12-strikes-Christmas-Walkouts-hit-UK-day-festive-period.html">from now to Christmas</a>. They <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62134314">include</a> unprecedented planned walkouts by nurses, paramedics, ambulance services, railway workers, post handlers, people who work in the education sector, airline workers and dock workers amongst others.</p>
<p>Most seem to be driven by pay offers that are substantially below inflation, which poses real problems when many people are already in the midst of a <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cost-living-crisis">cost of living crisis</a>. There&rsquo;s also increasingly arduous and impossible working conditions in some roles, often exacerbated by there being far too many unfilled vacancies for a safe and efficient service to be offered.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s nice to see is that despite the best attempts of the Government, and some parts of the media, to blame the strikers for being greedy, lazy or whatever - the most high-profile unhinged attack perhaps being the chairman of the Conservatives claiming that the people going on strike <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/vladimir-putin-wants-nhs-nurses-to-go-on-strike-says-conservative-party-chairman_uk_638c7095e4b07530543af20b">are supporting Putin</a> -  recent surveys suggest that a higher proportion of the public are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/04/december-of-discontent-will-strikers-or-government-and-management-take-the-blame">generally on the side of the strikers</a> rather than the management or government.</p>
<p>Most of the strikes I&rsquo;ve heard about are in the public sector, but more private interests are not wholly exempt. Perhaps the most dystopian one I&rsquo;ve read about so far is that employees of the homelessness charity <a href="https://www.shelter.org.uk/">Shelter</a> are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/05/homelessness-charity-shelter-staff-start-unprecedented-two-week-strike">contemplating having to go on strike</a> on the basis that their current pay offer may result in they themselves ending up homeless, being unable to afford their own living accommodation.</p>
<p>One common riposte of the government is that &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t possibly pay essential civil servants cost of living increases because it&rsquo;ll make inflation go even higher&rdquo;. One thing I&rsquo;ve never understood in these sorts of arguments is why, if they really believe that to be true, they continuously hold back the pay of public servants but yet never seem to legislate for - or even advise -  private businesses to do the same.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I do understand it; it would probably cause an outcry amongst a certain amount of the public, and be absolute anathema to especially the Truss contingent of the Conservative party. But in theory this to me would be a more consistent form of same idea, even if I would most likely be opposed to it in the same way that I&rsquo;m opposed to making our public servants even poorer. I&rsquo;m open to arguments why this isn&rsquo;t the case though, it&rsquo;s certainly not my area of expertise.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, it&rsquo;s not like the government doesn&rsquo;t <em>already</em> exert control over the rates of pay private businesses can offer. Two contemporary examples include <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/national-minimum-wage-entitlement">minimum wage legislation</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/15/what-is-the-banker-bonus-cap-and-could-scrapping-it-boost-growth">the cap on banker&rsquo;s bonuses</a>.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780575114968">The Prestige</a> by Christopher Priest 📚.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this part science-fiction, part gothic horror, tale. Most of the story is presented as diary entries from two 19th century magicians who become obsessed with competing with each other, sabotaging each other&rsquo;s tricks whilst fervently trying to understand and outperform each other&rsquo;s best illusions at any cost. The cost turns out to be quite significant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous enough Christopher Nolan <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-prestige-2006">film of the book</a>. In some ways it&rsquo;s presented quite differently and, from memory, it totally misses out the book&rsquo;s start and end. But it has basically the same main reveal. So the novel&rsquo;s twists and turns may have had even more impact had I not seen that first. But it was still an enthralling and gripping read, worth it even if you saw the film.</p>

<p>This book is as clear an intro as I can imagine there is, although some of the later more advanced topics I admit I rather glossed over. It seems the sort of approach you can likely only master by doing, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying out some of the techniques for real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a useful refresher on regression and factor analysis, those being components of many SEMs, for anyone looking to remind themselves what those practices all about.</p>

			 <p>Below are notes I took whilst reading the paper &ldquo;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23088">Self-Monitoring via Digital Health in Weight Loss Interventions - A Systematic Review Among Adults with Overweight or Obesity</a>&rdquo;, by Michele L. Patel, Lindsay N. Wakayama and Gary G. Bennett.</p>
<p>Self-monitoring is a key component of standard treatments for obesity. Using digital tools, as opposed to paper-based monitoring, may reduce some of the obstacles faced when someone tries to do this, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They may reduce the time it takes to track one&rsquo;s diet, e.g. with nutrition databases that automatically populate nutrition info, or features that suggest entries.</li>
<li>Wearable technologies allow for passive rather than active monitoring.</li>
<li>We may be able to raise engagement levels via individualised feedback and prompts.</li>
<li>Phones are very portable meaning that monitoring can be done in real time wherever you are, rather than retrospectively.</li>
<li>They may reduce numeracy and health literacy barriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper reviews 39 randomised controlled trials published between 2009 and 2019 which:</p>
<ul>
<li>featured interventions designed to aid weight loss for participants with overweight or obesity.</li>
<li>involved the use of digital tracking tools.</li>
<li>had  interventions that lasted at least 12 weeks and included outcomes around self-monitoring engagement and a weight loss outcome from at least 6 months after enrollment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its primary aim is to determine whether digital self-monitoring is associated with weight loss. Secondarily, it looks to understand the types of digital methods used for self-monitoring and their engagement rates in the associated interventions.</p>
<p>Of the 67 interventions involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>72% of them involved self-monitoring of weight.</li>
<li>81% involved self-monitoring of dietary intake. Mostly this involved tracking food intake or calories.</li>
<li>82% involved self-monitoring of physical activity. Mostly this meant tracking the durations of physical activity, but sometimes it was step count, types of exercises or other related items.</li>
<li>7% self-monitored specific behaviour change goals.</li>
<li>54% included monitoring all of weight, dietary intake and activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most commonly this was done via a website (66% of treatment arms), with a lower number using mobile apps (33%), wearable devices (16%), electronic scales (12%) and text messaging (12%), PDAs (3%) or IVR technology (3%). In several cases participants were given a choice as to which method they preferred.</p>
<p>Some interventions used commercial websites or apps, others used websites specific to the study.</p>
<p>Only 9% of interventions that recommended daily digital self-monitoring engagement saw participants engage for at least 75% of the days concerned.  58% of arms saw engagements for at least half of the recommended days.</p>
<ul>
<li>These numbers are higher in shorter interventions and vice versa.</li>
<li>Engagement was highest when the intervention involved self-monitoring weight. The rate was somewhat lower for diet monitoring, and lower yet for physical activity. This may be confounded by differences in the frequency prescribed the opportunities to to record.</li>
<li>Engagement was typically higher with digital as opposed to paper-based monitoring.</li>
<li>The addition of counselling usually didn&rsquo;t increase the engagement rate.</li>
<li>Passive self-monitoring behaviours (e.g. wearable devices) had higher engagement rates than active self-monitoring methods, although one study showed that passive weight tracking was less associated with weight loss, perhaps because it doesn&rsquo;t promote awareness of one&rsquo;s behaviour as much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some studies compared engagement outcomes between monitoring modalities. Factors that were associated with engagement when comparison were possible include the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>incentives.</li>
<li>enhancements.</li>
<li>a wearable device.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a positive association between high levels of digital self-monitoring and increased weight loss in 74% of cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rates didn&rsquo;t differ much based on what was monitored, with the exception that of the 3 studies that involved monitoring behaviour change goals only 1 showed an association with weight loss.</li>
<li>Interventions that lasted at least 12 months were less likely to show an association than those that were shorter. This may either be because of rates self-monitoring engagement or weight loss declining over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>One limitation of these studies is that participants were never randomised to different levels of self-monitoring; thus high frequency monitors are self-selected and may differ from each other in other ways.</p>
<p>Researchers should use strategies such as the multiphase optimisation strategy to understand the different impact of different self-monitoring strategies.</p>
<p>Research into how to prevent the decline in self-monitoring engagement over time is needed, as well as understanding the predictors and moderators of self-monitoring engagements. Personalisation may be needed; some people may succeed more on one self-monitoring approach than others.</p>
<p>In the mean time adults with overweight or obesity should be encouraged to self-monitor frequently when undergoing interventions that are aimed at weight loss.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/30/the-census-reveals.html">The 2021 census reveals a sizeable shift from people identifying as Christian to instead having no religion</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/30/the-census-reveals.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-30 11:22:31 &#43;0100">Nov 30, 2022</time></a>

			 <p>The 2021 England and Wales census results are <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census">out now</a>. Most headlines are focussing on the fact that this is the first time that less than 50% of our country now identifies as Christian. It&rsquo;s dropped 13 percentage points vs the 2011 census and now sits at 46%.</p>
<p>Some are finding this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/29/calls-grow-to-disestablish-church-of-england-as-christians-become-minority">particularly noteworthy</a> in a country where the head of state - King Charles -  is also the head of the Church of England, officially the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/defender-of-the-faith">Defender of the Faith</a>&rdquo;.  26 Church of England bishops <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/bishops/">hold power</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords">House of Lords</a> - the so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a>&rdquo;. In theory state schools <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/281929/Collective_worship_in_schools.pdf">are required </a>to hold daily acts of Christian worship, although many in reality <a href="https://religionmediacentre.org.uk/factsheets/collective-worship-in-england-and-wales/">do not</a> and suffer no consequences.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The vast majority of the difference is explained by an increasing number of people declaring that they do not follow any religion. That&rsquo;s <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/29/uk/england-wales-christianity-census-intl/index.html">increased by 12 percentage points </a>compared to 10 years ago and currently sits at 37% of the country; around 22 million people.</p>
<p>In terms of percentage growth rates, some of the smaller &ldquo;religions&rdquo; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/29/ten-things-weve-learned-from-the-england-and-wales-census">top the leaderboard</a> - although of course there&rsquo;s a lot more room to grow by incredible sounding rates when you start from a very small number. Devotees of Shamanism have increased from 650 people ten years ago to 8,000 now. Pagans increased from 57,000 to 74,000, and there are now 13,000 folk identifying as Wiccan.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/29/some-elon-musk.html">Some Elon Musk Twitter takeover miscellany</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/29/some-elon-musk.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-29 13:22:29 &#43;0100">Nov 29, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the excoriating misery that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">&ldquo;Elon Musk bought Twitter&rdquo;</a> discourse - an institution which has disproven any sense we had between 2016 and 2021 that it couldn&rsquo;t really get much worse - there have been a couple of brighter spots I&rsquo;ve appreciated.</p>
<p>Firstly I often ponder about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect">power of defaults</a>. I&rsquo;d wonder about what would happen if society ever decided to reverse some of the more ingrained ones. For example, what if if each month the norm was that you actively <em>opted in</em> to your job if you were happy to keep it, rather than the more conventional awkward and emotional opt out scenario.</p>
<p>Another big one is my eternal curiosity about what would happen if the threat of immediate poverty wasn&rsquo;t there. That might reduce the incentive to stay with your current employer, however unsatisfactory they are, purely on the basis that they&rsquo;re slightly less dreadful than the prospective life of penury might be.</p>
<p>Happily Elon managed to address both at the same time. He <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23464178/elon-musk-twitter-employees-ultimatum-severance-agreement-faq-document">emailed all Twitter employees</a> to let them know that they had to click on a link if they wanted to keep their job; very much an opt-in workflow. Let&rsquo;s hope that by some magical force everyone read and understood the email by the deadline. Also this is likely illegal in many countries Twitter has employees in, but, you know, Elon.</p>
<p>He also seemed to offer 3 months pay, no questions asked, for those that didn&rsquo;t want to opt in. Additionally, this is a company where many folk were likely well-paid enough to have some savings (citation needed I accept). Those who held any Twitter stock might in fact be richer than they&rsquo;d ever been before given how much above market value Elon was forced to buy the company for.</p>
<p>I should note that it&rsquo;s not all upside; I dare say many of the staff weren&rsquo;t in a particularly privileged position - the company did not survive on elite coders alone. I also felt especially sorry for people on the kind of foreign visas that require you to keep working or be deported, not least because he&rsquo;d fired half the company even before he got to this point.</p>
<p>The consequence? Well, it seems like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-elon-musk-half-working-2022-11">thousands of employees</a> - more than half of Twitter&rsquo;s entire staff - decided to take the offer and quit. Whole departments in some cases.</p>
<p>Of course this particular situation is very confounded by having the knowledge that if you choose to stay then you do so in the knowledge that your new boss will be something of an egomaniac madman who not only goes to sleep next to an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-bedside-table-picture-guns-books-coke-buddhist-object-2022-11">unsettling display of mostly Americana</a> each night but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462026/elon-musk-twitter-email-hardcore-or-severance">made it very clear</a> that you will have to sacrifice all other aspects of your life so you can do &lsquo;extremely hardcore&rsquo; work and be subjected to his fire-at-will tantrums. So I suppose to answer my underlying questions I&rsquo;d really need to wait for a more natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment">natural experiment</a>.</p>
<p>The other entertaining thing was when Elon chose to make one of the most consequential and controversial social media moderation decisions of the recent era - whether to allow Donald Trump back in - via, of course, an unconstrained <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593767953706921985">Twitter poll</a>. It gave him the result I imagine he wanted, albeit only by the same kind of margin as the Brexit referendum <a href="https://theconversation.com/leave-wins-uk-brexit-referendum-52-48-61428">ended up having</a> - many of us Britons cannot see the numbers 52 and 48 next to each other without a slight flash of anxiety.</p>
<p>He then reinstated the Trump account together with <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777">a declaration in Latin</a> - &ldquo;Vox Populi, Vox Dei&rdquo; that in its original context means the virtually the opposite of what I imagine he was aiming to project. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_populi#Vox_populi,_vox_Dei">Translating</a> to something like &ldquo;The voice of the people is the voice of God&rdquo;, the <a href="https://www.historynet.com/what-is-the-history-of-vox-populi-vox-dei/">earliest known usage</a> of that fragment  was around the year 800 in a sentence which in fact reads as  &ldquo;&hellip;those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always close to insanity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the subject of &ldquo;close to insanity&rdquo;, in any case Trump was all &lsquo;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-twitter-poll-showing-narrow-majority-want-trump-reinstated-2022-11-20/">no thanks, not interested</a>&rsquo;. I first assumed this was because he was either in a huff that he was subject to the whims of another dangerous weird billionaire, or too busy coming up with some semi-illegal scheme to keep on reducing the voteshare that the US Republicans get by virtue of being their presidential nominee.</p>
<p>But now I understand that he&rsquo;s just literally <em>not allowed</em> to tweet in his usual style as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/trump-twitter-return-truth-social">his contract</a> with his current maelstrom of a social network - possibly the most incorrectly named site on the internet - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social">Truth Social</a>. Not to say he won&rsquo;t break the contract; he has of course plenty of form conducting <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/9/28/12904136/donald-trump-corrupt">unethical and likely illegal business practices</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, that&rsquo;s more than enough on that subject. Honestly I have wasted a lot more time reading about Musk and Twitter in recent times than I should have. But then again I have heard <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/the-fraudulent-king">this article</a> is good&hellip;must resist, must resist.</p>

			 <p>Finished playing <a href="https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> 🎮.</p>
<p>This game created something of a sensation when it came out 6 years ago. I&rsquo;d no doubt it was good but I&rsquo;d understood it to be a time consuming open-world adventure so figured it wouldn&rsquo;t work well for my typical adult life 20 minute-ish gaming sessions. However it turns out that I did find it extremely worthy of all the game of the year awards it won so I&rsquo;m very glad I gave it a go. It is in fact really great, and you can definitely play it in shortish bursts if you have to (and have the willpower to turn it off).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It tells the story of Link, who awakens with no memory of the past but is nonetheless thrust on a mission to save the land of Hyrule from the evil forces of Ganon.</p>
<p>My fear of its open-world nature meaning that typically I&rsquo;d find myself wandering around lost for ages not knowing what to do was entirely alleviated by the facts that both 1) the game makes it pretty obvious what your potential next steps are, and 2) the world is so delightful, in how it looks and how it works, that for the first time I was very happy to wander around kinda lost, dealing with the strange little side quests that in most games I&rsquo;d feel compelled to ignore just to get the main mission done.</p>
<p>The so-called physics and chemistry engine is such that there&rsquo;s a real sense of freedom. You can do almost anything you think you might be able to do within the scope of the game. Metal swords are good for stabbing monsters, sure. But they can also create a spark which, if you do it with some flint near a pile of wood, will start a fire and let you cook some food. The updraft from said heat source lets you float upwards should you have the right equipment. You could also use the fire to light an arrow and fire it to ignite any dry grass around where monsters are having a nap consume them in a fiery death. There&rsquo;s probably 100 other things you could do like that I never discovered.</p>
<p>Even watching someone else play it for a while gave me a pleasant sense of the kind of feeling one gets when travelling to a new place and exploring in real life. This was most welcome at the time, as it was the heart of the Covid-19 lockdown when actually travelling anywhere wasn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p>And as you can see from the screenshot, it&rsquo;s a mostly pretty, nature-based place, which made me wonder if there&rsquo;s any research out there about using computer games to provide a mild version of the benefits humans tend to get with actual exploration in the natural world. Whilst this might sound a bit implausible, and it certainly won&rsquo;t provide the substantial benefits of the physical activity that&rsquo;s typically associated with exploring the outdoors, there are supposedly health benefits that can be realised via some video games. That&rsquo;s a topic I&rsquo;d like to explore sometimes.</p>
<p>One tip that I wished I&rsquo;d have known before playing (for compulsive in-game hoarders such as myself) is that you really don&rsquo;t need to keep most of the things you find. You don&rsquo;t need to collect and upgrade everything to win. If you follow the main storyline then the end battle isn&rsquo;t actually super hard, and I&rsquo;m really not that good at videogames - I never really mastered the combat in this one.</p>
<p>But by the end I was constantly running out of inventory space.  So feel free to sell most of the &ldquo;consumable&rdquo; things that you discover, even some of the valuable ore, to make enough money to buy the stuff in the shops that will make life less frustrating, some of which is basically essential. You can almost always find more of whatever consumables you run out of. Of course if you&rsquo;re a pro trying to collect and upgrade 100% of everything then this may be terrible advice.</p>

			 <p>Listening to <a href="https://album.link/es/i/1622579188">Hold The Girl</a> by Rina Sawayama 🎶.</p>
<p>Whilst the album&rsquo;s approach was purportedly <a href="https://people.com/music/rina-sawayama-says-taylor-swift-folklore-inspired-her-new-album-hold-the-girl/">inspired by</a> Taylor Swift&rsquo;s <a href="https://album.link/es/i/1524801260">Folklore</a>, perhaps performing some kind of therapeutic function for Rina, perhaps what most stands out about it is the sheer variety of genres that the songs encompass.</p>
<p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_the_Gir">currently lists</a> it as being some combination of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1990s alternative rock, pop rock, soft rock, Europop, trance, industrial, country pop, hi-NRG, pop punk, Eurotrance, stadium rock, Britpop, disco, R&amp;B, hyperpop, J-pop, house, Eurodance, electronic, UK garage, techno, folk and psychedelic music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, there&rsquo;s got to be something for most people on this album. Here&rsquo;s one I liked.</p>

			 <p>The rule of thumb that, in exchange for having expensive seeming prices and usage restrictions on its devices, Apple was less likely to creepily surveil and store your personal behavioural data on its servers for undisclosed and unknowable reasons seems to be invalid now.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago we saw Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/">What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone</a>&rdquo; marketing slogan.  More recently though  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558">researchers have shown</a> that, even when you disable the sharing of device analytics, the App Store and many of the other built-in iPhone apps send tracking info back to apple.</p>
<blockquote>

			 <p>I learned a lot about eating poo this week. Apparently it&rsquo;s well-known that <a href="https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/rabbits-eat-poop/">rabbits eat their own faeces</a> - or at least the caecotroph variant of droppings. The nutrients it still contains are good for their health.  But it wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we found a species that eats a good amount of any other species' excrement.</p>
<p>A genetic analysis shows that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62135261">foxes eat dog poo,</a> particularly in environments where there&rsquo;s not much else out there to eat. Unsurprisingly poop is much easier to hunt than wild prey. Perhaps more surprisingly it has a similar calorific content.</p>
<p>It does potentially add to the risk of disease, including of new pathogens appearing -  so I doubt &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeding the foxes&rdquo;  can be considered a valid excuse for not being bothered to pick up any dog faeces you may be responsible for.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a common idea that you can translate the age of a dog to the equivalent age of a human by multiplying by 7. It&rsquo;s easily disprovable at a basic level insomuch as different breeds of dogs tend to live for <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-age">different numbers of years</a> . I chanced upon <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/829192v2">a preprint</a> that also suggests the idea of a linear &ldquo;human years multiplied by X&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t right either.</p>
<p>Something more akin to reality turns out to involve slightly more complicated math. The researchers based their results on Labrador retrievers as the reference dog, and determined via comparing methylomes between species that the relationship between humans and dog lives <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-s-the-real-human-equivalent-of-your-dog-s-age-here-s-a-new-formula-to-figure-it-out">is better expressed as</a>:</p>
<p><code>human age = 16ln(dog age) + 31</code></p>
<p>The ln there represents taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm">natural log</a> of a number, which you can calculate <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/Ln_Calc.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>One advantage of this non-linear view is that it allows certain physiological milestones line up much better - for example lining up the typical time puppies and humans develop teeth, as well as correspondingly similar average overall lifespans.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781925693942">All Our Relations</a> by Tanya Talaga 📚.</p>
<p>Starting out by focussing on a suicide epidemic amongst young Canadian Indigenous people, this book chronicles the historic, and unfortunately oftentimes ongoing, injustices that have been meted out on Indigenous people ever since the usually white European colonists &lsquo;discovered&rsquo; the &lsquo;New World&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From a past of overtly eliminating a people they regarded as inferior, through to more recent decades which included a &lsquo;residential schools&rsquo; policy forcibly assimilating any remaining Indigenous children, the author argues that the now-dominant society has caused physical, mental, cultural and spiritual crises amongst entire communities of Indigenous people.</p>
<p>A few success stories are included showing that there may be hope when these communities are able to develop or collaborate on culturally and practically relevant solutions to situations so bad that poor health, poverty, addiction, isolation, despair and even suicide is commonplace.</p>
<p>The focus seems mainly on the Canadian experience, but several examples from elsewhere are provided. Upsettingly, they lead towards the conclusion that the offences committed against, and resulting challenges faced by, Indigenous people around the world are quite similar.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/18/the-conservative-autumn.html">The Conservative Autumn Statement seems short term...progressive?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m somewhat shocked to feel this way given the source, but I don&rsquo;t hate all the policies from the Conservative&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/autumn-statement-2022-key-points-jeremy-hunt-budget">autumn statement</a> announced yesterday. At least not in the short term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much changes within a few weeks. Whilst some of the policies under the Truss administration <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/07/freezing-tax-thresholds.html">weren&rsquo;t nearly as tax-cutting as it seemed</a> on the surface, they were <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html">extremely regressive</a>. Just last month we were hearing that the top rate of income tax was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2022/oct/02/liz-truss-admits-mistakes-over-mini-budget-but-stands-by-45-top-rate-tax-cut-video">going to be entirely abolished</a> - free money for the rich! And now under the Sunak administration it&rsquo;s actually going to be applied to more people; anyone with an income of over around £125k as opposed to the current £150k.</p>
<p>Benefits are going up inline with inflation, we&rsquo;re seeing an increase in capital gains tax and a fiscal drag on inheritance tax. And a windfall tax on the incredible profits of energy producers. All very un-Conservative-stereotype.</p>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s still grim news in the economy - basically everyone is going to be worse off in the near feature. Living standards are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/biggest-hit-to-living-standards-on-record-as-jeremy-hunt-lays-out-autumn-statement">set to fall</a> by an unprecedented 7%. Plenty of this is due to the <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/13/some-context-as.html">abject mismanagement</a> of the economy by the Conservative party in recent times.  Unemployment, inflation and energy bills are all set to rise. If you&rsquo;re already struggling that&rsquo;s obviously a much huger burden than if you&rsquo;re doing well enough right now.</p>
<p>The statement&rsquo;s policies are not nearly enough to make life particularly bearable for anyone already in or near crisis. But, I guess, credit where credit&rsquo;s due - the tax changes announced yesterday are actually somewhat progressive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reproduction of the impact <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/help-today-squeeze-tomorrow/">calculated by the Resolution Foundation</a> provided by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/18/british-people-poorer-ifs-uk-autumn-statement">the Guardian</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Where the statement is rather more disingenuous is with regards to cuts in public funding. Cuts to public services tend to impact the poorest in society more than the rich. Cuts are certainly in the statement, and they&rsquo;re big (and <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/austerity-policies-kill.html">dangerous</a>). But the bulk of them are scheduled not to hit until 2024-2025. Of course by then there&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;ll have had a general election. A cynic might suggest it&rsquo;s a cursed gift from a party that doesn&rsquo;t really believe it&rsquo;ll be in power at that point.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s mostly more of the same, so if you found the (post-introduction of female scientists) stereotypes problematic then you still will. If you found the geek references, characters or general style annoying or stale then not all that much changed. But if you took pleasure from the fairly predictable series and its nerdy references then it&rsquo;s worth finishing it off.</p>
<p>Much of the ending is comfortably heart-warming, although I do feel sympathy for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/the-big-bang-theory-finale-penny-pregnancy.html">Kathryn VanArendonk&rsquo;s frustration</a> with one of the storylines (warning: the link containers spoilers, albeit for a 3 year old episode).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/10/england-mental-health-services-compassion-scandals-patients">This</a> is a sentiment I feel I&rsquo;ve seen from quite a few articles recently.</p>
<p>Not just in terms of statistics, but a more general idea that we may finally be becoming more understanding and supportive of people with more common, typically less severe, mental health issues such as mild anxiety or depression - something that is undoubtedly good and necessary. But that there&rsquo;s a way in which it&rsquo;s been somewhat at the expense of folk with extremely serious and debilitating conditions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have a sense of to what extent this is a real phenomenon or not. But it does seem like it&rsquo;s an idea that&rsquo;s in the ether at present.</p>

			 <p>A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4126641">recent paper</a> quantifies the economic inequities exacerbated by the way that credit cards that offer rewards to their users work.</p>
<p>Of course the cost of these rewards has to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>This includes the various fees and interest charged by the credit card companies to its users. Unsurprisingly, people with low credit scores are more likely to end up paying these fees.</p>
<p>Now whilst credit rating doesn&rsquo;t correlate 1:1 with e.g. income - so as the paper says the net effect isn&rsquo;t a <em>pure</em> &ldquo;take money from the poor to give to the rich&rdquo; money grab - it does predictably correlate with various other dimensions of potential privilege. It&rsquo;s obviously a lot easier to pay off your credit card balance and not incur interest charges if you have a big pile of existing money at your disposal.</p>
<p>Credit card companies also make money by charging shops every time a customer uses their credit card. To the extent that the need to fund rewards results in the credit card companies increasing the merchant fees to retailers, who correspondingly increase their products' prices to compensate, that&rsquo;s also another way that poorer folk may be penalised - a small % increase in cost may not be noticed by the wealthy, but for people in poverty it might be that every penny counts.</p>
<p>Retailers don&rsquo;t usually charge different prices for customers based on which card they use to purchase something, and so those people who don&rsquo;t choose to use or do not have access to rewards credit cards may end up paying for other people to get rewards.</p>

<p>We estimate an aggregate annual redistribution of $15 billion from less to more educated, poorer to richer, and high to low minority areas, widening existing spatial disparities.</p>

			 <p>Listening to <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1645937249">Midnights</a>, by Taylor Swift 🎶.</p>
<p>In possibly the coldest take available on the internet today, Taylor Swift&rsquo;s new album is really good. It&rsquo;s <a href="">broken a few records</a> in terms of sales and popularity.</p>
<p>When I first listened to it I felt like all the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/taylor-swift-midnights-switched-on-pop.html">bassy synths</a> gave it a kind of ominous feel that I didn&rsquo;t need in 2022, but a couple of listens later and I fully appreciate it. The general conceit is that each song reflects a sleepless night of her life, and sure enough some of the included angst may be familiar to those of us who are not multi-millionaire musical megastars too.</p>
<p>Apparently the album is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/nov/09/how-taylor-swift-turned-pop-into-a-multiplayer-puzzle">filled with secret messages</a> for the internet to discover. I came to Swift far too late and probably lackadaisically to get any of them but they&rsquo;re there for those more informed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the highlights, with a fun spooky (albeit <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-fat-anti-hero-video-b2211554.html">originally controversial</a>) video.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/06/immigration-to-meet.html">Immigration to meet unfilled medical staff needs is a popular policy</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/11/06/immigration-to-meet.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-11-06 15:34:28 &#43;0100">Nov 6, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Things like <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63526167">this</a> are exactly what cause me <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/25/what-does-the.html">angst about joining the Labour party</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair the headline &ldquo;<em>Keir Starmer: Too many people from overseas recruited to NHS</em>&rdquo; is a little selective, perhaps misleadingly so. Within the same interview Starmer also said he&rsquo;d encourage immigration for different types of jobs. He also acknowledged that we have a desperate need for more NHS staff. But his proposed solution was that the UK needs to do way more in terms of increasing training opportunities and making jobs in the NHS bearable enough that any sane person isn&rsquo;t so deterred by the conditions that they wouldn&rsquo;t want the training in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fully on board with that as a plank of the approach. It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. But it&rsquo;s not an either/or situation. We have a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nhs-staff-crisis-20000-doctors-28417859">NHS staffing crisis</a> right now. Earlier this year it was calculated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/staffing-crisis-deepens-in-nhs-england-with-110000-posts-unfilled">around 110,000 NHS vacancies were unfilled</a>. A British politician with the wellbeing of their constituents in mind should use whatever reasonable means we have to solve it.</p>
<p>Starmer is not known to be a naïve or stupid politician so when he said &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d have understood how that might sound.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly gruelling about this example is that reducing the immigration of medical workers isn&rsquo;t even a popular policy. In the latest poll I can find, most people are actively in favour of immigration in terms of increasing the supply of doctors and nurses in the UK.</p>
<p>From page 15 of <a href="https://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Shifting-Views-Report-Oct-2022-FINAL.pdf">the British Future report</a> on attitudes to immigration this year:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>55% of respondents to this survey commissioned from IPSOS, designed to be representative of the British pouplation,  would prefer recruitment of migrants as nurses to increase, with only 13% against. The figures for doctors are very similar.</p>
<p>Even most <em>Conservative party supporters</em> are in favour! Compared to Labour supporters they&rsquo;re more likely to say the numbers should be reduced, but only by a few percentage points.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Of course this might not be apparent in the public discourse. Inevitably there is a certain percentage of the population who would rather see the immigration numbers go down than sustain the NHS. They&rsquo;re loudly represented on social media, likely encouraged by the recent Conservative tendency to seemingly try and recreate a US-style <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-tories-plan-assault-woke-culture-war/">culture war</a> to our shores.</p>
<p>This is not to say that what job you do necessarily should be the basis of your ability to immigrate to the UK - I believe it <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> be. But the point is that there is likely little need to &ldquo;strategically&rdquo; appear to be against immigration to fill NHS positions if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on,  because most of the population actually wants to see more.</p>
<p>There certainly is a moral case to be made against encouraging immigration to fulfil Britain&rsquo;s unmet medical needs, but it&rsquo;s a very different one. As Kollar and Buyx write in <a href="https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2013.13845">their review</a> of this phenomena:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Health-worker migration, commonly called “medical brain drain”, refers to the mass migration of trained and skilled health professionals (doctors, nurses, midwives) from low-income to high-income countries. This is currently leaving a significant number of poor countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, with critical staff shortages in the healthcare sector. A broad consensus exists that, where medical brain drain exacerbates such shortages, it is unethical&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplistically, one foreign nurse moving here is potentially one less nurse serving the country they were originally in. If done en masse, probably some recompense, ideally of a structural nature, should be given. However, this debate doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the one that interests the politicians, media or general public at present.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780141184999">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez 📚.</p>
<p>This one is a real classic, perhaps the archetype of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Magic_realism">magical realism</a> . That&rsquo;s a style most associated with Latin American authors where things are going along just like we might ourselves expect to happen in real life. But occasionally something unquestionably fantastical happens. People fly, ghosts appear, spells are cast - whatever you can imagine. But to the characters in the book it&rsquo;s perfectly normal, not even worth remarking on. Their world just works that way.</p>
<p>This book tells the story of many generations of a family in a beautiful, sometimes poetic, manner. In some parts it felt like hearing someone&rsquo;s dream experience, other times more like a myth or legend from times long past.</p>
<p>Parts were somewhat disorientating to me, not least because many of the characters have similar names to each other; a fact remarked on within the book. It should be noted that there are some &lsquo;uncomfortable&rsquo; scenes, and took me a good amount of focus to get through it. But it was an entirely worthwhile effort to make.</p>

<p>So I liked it, but I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek">Daleks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman">Cybermen</a> enough as sci-fi enemies that you could even put them in <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/11/01/matt-hancock-the.html">Matt Hancock&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity&rdquo;</a> and I&rsquo;d say it was good. Add in the master, UNIT and the actual companions and various previous incarnations of the eponymous hero themselves from decades-old episodes and it can&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>It might be fairly said that the story itself was rather chaotic and incoherent at times, so I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who thought it was too messy to follow. But if you have any nostalgia for Dr W then you&rsquo;ll probably like it.</p>
<p>Also a great ending. I often regret seeing all the early &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61371123">the next Doctor will be played by X</a>&rdquo; stories as it naturally  spoils the when and who of the relevant episode&rsquo;s grand finale.

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Happy Halloween!</p>
<p>My current favourite recently-learned spooky fact is that the infamous film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist">The Exorcist</a> - the one that originally induced audiences to faint, vomit and maybe even have heart attacks - is in fact based on a true story. It&rsquo;s the story of Ronald Edwin Hunkeler, although his name wasn&rsquo;t widely known <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/20/the-exorcist-boy-named-magazine">until last year</a>, after he had died the year before.</p>
<p>From the age of 14 it was reported that he had been <a href="https://screenrant.com/exorcist-movie-true-story-regan-roland-doe-explained/">possessed by something menacing</a>. People around him heard strange noise, and things flew around the house. Red scratches appeared on his body, spelling out various words. He had violent outbursts and spoke Latin phrases in a strange voice. Walls shook and furniture slid. All of which you may have seen in the film&rsquo;s recreation, albeit featuring a younger girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that the infamous head-spinning scene actually happened in Ronald&rsquo;s case though. Which is shown below, but perhaps don&rsquo;t click on it if you don&rsquo;t like scary things or bad language.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>In later life, Ronald became a NASA engineer. His work was used in the 1960s Apollo space missions and, more recently, for space shuttle materials. He apparently went out of his way to ensure people didn&rsquo;t know of his exorcist related history, unfortunately going through his life always afraid of people figuring it out.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it&rsquo;s now a matter of debate how true the true story was. The fact that The Exorcist is based on Ronald and what people around him reported is true. But whether the original events concerned were of paranormal origin or were in fact deliberate trickery done by the kid has been <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/2001/01/exorcism-driving-out-the-nonsense/">questioned at some length</a>. But even if it was an act, it sounds like it was an unusually convincing and long-lasting one from a likely troubled child.</p>

			 <p>A descendent of Captain William Humphries has <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/library-books-overdue-man-returns-book-84-years-late-and-pays-the-fine/e9c197c5-7fe5-4060-9286-674b74354777">finally returned</a> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14375826-red-deer">Red Deer</a>&rdquo; - a book by Richard Jefferies that he borrowed in 1938 to a library in Coventry.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s in good condition apparently, which is kind of amazing when most likely it was kept in a house that was bombed in the Blitz.</p>
<p>Being 84 years overdue it had accumulated quite a fine. Fortunately at 1 old penny a day it only worked out to £18.27 in today&rsquo;s money. Embarrassingly, I&rsquo;ve paid library fines bigger than that. Today the library charges 25p per day, so if someone pulls the same stunt again <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-63404340">that&rsquo;ll cost them £7673</a>.</p>
<p>It was returned by the Captain&rsquo;s grandson Paddy Riordan, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-63404340">told the BBC</a> that he wasn&rsquo;t sure why it had taken so long to get returned, but &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t that exciting a book&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Believe it or not it&rsquo;s by no means the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67353-most-overdue-library-book">most overdue return</a> of a library book. That honour is held  by the catchily named &ldquo;Scriptores rerum Germanicarum septentrionalium, vicinorumque populorum diversi&rdquo;. That translates to &ldquo;Various historians of the Northern Germans and of neighbouring peoples&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A copy of that book was <a href="https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/worlds-most-overdue-library-book">returned to Sidney Sussex College 288 years after</a> it had been borrowed in the year 1668.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This one had been borrowed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole_(colonel)">Colonel Robert Walpole</a>, who was an MP in 1689, and the father of the confusingly similar named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a>, who Wikipedia records as being the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom">Prime Minister of the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In that case no fine was exacted.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Originally sighted running rampage over the human-deserted lockdown streets of Llandudno, it&rsquo;s apparently got out of control enough that a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/27/wales-mischievous-goats-will-get-task-force-to-control-them-17650457/">special taskforce has had to be convened</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They&rsquo;re descended from some Kashmir mountain goats that Queen Victoria, forgetting that a goat is for life, not just for Christmas, gave to Llandudno a century ago (or perhaps actually <a href="https://www.llandudno.com/the-great-orme-kashmiri-goats/">regifted from the Shah of Persia</a>, to be accurate). She may have been a <a href="https://spearswms.com/the-story-of-cashmere-from-queen-victoria-to-loro-piana/">big fan of cashemere</a>, but somehow hadn&rsquo;t foreseen that Covid restrictions 100 years later would mean that their descendants wouldn&rsquo;t have access to contraception.</p>
<p>Consequently: welcome to the baby boom generation of the goat world. OK boomer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Who amongst us hasn&rsquo;t been caught running wild in streets, sleeping in bus shelters, fighting in the car park and snacking on people&rsquo;s hedges?   Nonetheless, the goats have seemingly been encouraged to return to their home, <a href="https://www.visitconwy.org.uk/explore/outdoors/great-orme-country-park">Great Orme</a>.</p>
<p>It all seems very good natured, with positive sentiments about them abounding, from anyone who hasn&rsquo;t had their houses eaten at least. I&rsquo;d imagine their relocation has probably not been entirely devoid of controversy though.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/councils-stance-great-orme-goats-20632525">there were rumours</a> that they&rsquo;d end up on the set of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Celebrity&hellip;Get me out of here!&rdquo; also known as <a href="https://www.gwrychcastle.co.uk/">Gwrych Castle</a>, which naturally is already full of beasts of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54724807">more spectral persuasion</a>. Some of the residents of Llandudno were not super pleased at this idea, with one ominously suggesting that &ldquo;If they take more than a few goats then people are going to be very upset.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(Also: a special thank you to my friend for highlighting this story - in memoriam of a site I used to have many years ago, sadly no longer in existence, which went through a phase of sharing these kind of critical goat news updates.)</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a recent tradition that each new Conservative Prime Minister gets to help design <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/10/25/liz-truss-downing-street-lectern-retired/">their own special lectern</a> to deliver speeches from. They cost £2000-£4000 to make; a lucrative business in recent times I guess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It seems like they&rsquo;re usually supposed to convey a certain something the PM wants to project. David Cameron&rsquo;s was supposed to look statesmanlike. Theresa May&rsquo;s was designed to look feminine. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s was a bit bulkier in order to cope with him thumping it during his more rousing speeches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the intent behind Liz Truss' twisty one, but it&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/barrymcgee/status/1583071601016217600">often described</a> as looking like a game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Jenga</a>. Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga">Wikipedia&rsquo;s description</a> of that game as involving &ldquo;creating a progressively more unstable structure&rdquo; this seems apt.</p>
<p>The version of it that was used for speeches in the Conservative HQ is predictably <a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Diver/status/1584854834716758017">covered in Union Jack designs</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Poor Rishi Sunak was appointed in such a hurry that there wasn&rsquo;t time for him to design his own one. He&rsquo;s ended up with a straight edition of Liz Truss&rsquo;s one that had been created &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/Tony_Diver/status/1584854834716758017">just in case</a>&rdquo;. In case of exactly <em>what</em> I&rsquo;m not sure, but, hey, it turned out to be useful after all.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not a member of any political party at the time of writing. This is the UK norm, with only around <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/17/i-was-curious.html">850k people</a> being affiliated to any party in that way, out of an electorate of around 47 million.</p>
<p>For years I&rsquo;ve felt uneasy about so directly supporting a party when all of them usually have some policy or other I firmly disagree with, especially without feeling like I&rsquo;ve had enough resources at hand to work towards enacting change from within.</p>
<p>In more recent times I&rsquo;ve also not felt I&rsquo;ve understood what any of the parties not in currently in power even really stand for. I&rsquo;ve ended up voting for various left-leaning parties over the years depending on the situation at the time.</p>
<p>However, in the present time of a truly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/liz-truss-resignation-brexit-brexitism">dangerous</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/23/the-last-days-of-truss-were-an-utter-shambles-then-the-real-chaos-began">chaotic</a> government, my previous rationales have started to feel potentially like weak excuses to me personally. I decided to try and figure out what the only other party that realistically at this point could win a national election, Labour, stands for to see if I could feel comfortable more directly supporting them.

<p>But get through all of that and there&rsquo;s a link to &ldquo;<a href="https://labour.org.uk/issue/economic-growth/">Labour&rsquo;s vision for Britain</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It looks like right now their number one priority is a plan for economic growth. This is understandable given the recent devastation of the economy by the present government and the impact this has had, and will have in future, on British citizens, even if I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/economic-growth/506423/">not convinced</a> that economic growth is the necessarily the measure a good society should optimise for. Historically though it has at least correlated with a lot of good things, but perhaps only <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0">up to a point</a>.</p>
<p>As to what they plan to do to fix the situation, much of the plan seems to be based on British job creation and industrial strategy.</p>
<p>At a glance I am good with the idea of altering business rates to promote investment, fairer competition and creating a council to inject a sense of long-term strategic thinking.  I&rsquo;m nowhere near expert enough to know whether these are plausible approaches to the problems at hand, but at least there&rsquo;s an intuitive reasonableness we can later determine if there&rsquo;s any evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;we want more fair and good green jobs&rdquo;- so as always the devil will be in the detail, but it&rsquo;s a reasonable vision to have.</p>
<p>In former days it&rsquo;d be one of those annoying generic slogans that it&rsquo;s hard to really imagine any mainstream party being against. But it actually doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anywhere near the top of the list of Conservative priorities - quite <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/75000-green-jobs-lost-under-the-conservatives-as-labour-calls-for-rapid-green-investment/">the opposite</a>. At times the Conservatives seem <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/tories-culture-war-win-back-popular-support-670637">desperate to inject culture-war topics</a> into the UK political sphere which isn&rsquo;t going to help on anything environmental.</p>
<p>What other concrete policies are Labour pursuing these days? To get a sense of their current priorities I checked out their <a href="https://labour.org.uk/issues/campaigns/">campaigns page</a>. Here&rsquo;s roughly what I gathered from a trawl of the various sections.</p>
<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boost people&rsquo;s income - better pay will improve the economy as well as tackle the cost of living crisis.</li>
<li>Ban zero hours contracts and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; self-employment.</li>
<li>End the &ldquo;qualifying periods&rdquo; some jobs have that mean people have to wait up to 2 years to realise certain rights, including unfair dismissal, sick pay and parental leave.</li>
<li>Update trade union legislation for the modern era, removing certain restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stop the energy price cap rising, by taxing high oil and gas profits.</li>
<li>Ensure people who have prepayment meters don&rsquo;t pay more for energy than everyone else.</li>
<li>Insulate all homes that need it.</li>
<li>Invest in sustainable British energy (wind, tidal, solar) and back nuclear energy.</li>
<li>Create a publicly owned energy company that delivers energy independence and security with 100% clean power by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="economy">Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build industries in every region of the UK.</li>
<li>Invest in electric car batteries, green steel, renewable ready ports.</li>
<li>Create a national wealth fund.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recruit 13,000 extra police / PCSO officers to rebuild neighbourhood policing</li>
<li>Improve training, vetting and misconduct procedures.</li>
<li>Introduce rules on strip-searching children.</li>
<li>Address the epidemic of violence against women/girls, including introducing domestic abuse experts.</li>
<li>Crack down on the criminal gangs who trade in people.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>Expand the NHS workforce by:</p>
<ul>
<li>doubling the number of medical school places and district nurses qualifying per year.</li>
<li>creating an additional 10,000 nursing/midwifery placements per year.</li>
<li>training 5000 new health visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>Primary school education: &ldquo;Build a Britain where children come first&rdquo; - this one was extremely vague.</p>
<h3 id="home-ownership">Home ownership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Target 70% home ownership.</li>
<li>Build high quality affordable homes</li>
<li>Reform the private rented sector</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-of-the-things-i-liked-in-what-i-saw">Some of the things I liked in what I saw:</h2>
<p>An emphasis on not just creating jobs, but ensuring they are secure, decent and paid well enough to provide a decent life. The fact that even under the current highly stigmatising welfare regime a whole lot of people claiming benefits, or even needing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40431701">to make use of food banks</a>, need to do so despite the fact they they have paid jobs is absurd.</p>
<p>Banning zero hours contact and fake self-employment feels like a good sentiment in general to reduce the abuse of folk in for example the gig economy. It is plausible to me that zero hours contracts could be used in a way beneficial to all in some limited cases so I don&rsquo;t know if a full ban is the correct answer. However they&rsquo;re right to identify that, surprise surprise, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2017/mar/27/the-bullying-and-fear-at-the-heart-of-zero-hour-contracts">that&rsquo;s not what actually happens at present</a> so it might be a good policy in net terms.</p>
<p>The green stuff: targeting of jobs and industry towards green industries, insulating homes, investing in green energy et al. The environment is the disaster-in-progress that may finally ruin the quality of or even end some of our lives if nothing else gets us first. Actually it <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1082564304/billions-of-people-are-in-danger-from-climate-change-u-n-report-warns">already is doing so</a>. Mitigating climate change should be a priority for every party, particularly as we already know a lot of what needs to be done - it&rsquo;s a case of actually <em>doing</em> it.</p>
<p>Expanding the NHS workforce, assuming this comes with investment. After the Covid pandemic and chronic mismanagement on the part of the Conservatives, the NHS is in a quite precarious state with huge waiting lists to catch up on - including 6 million people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/14/number-of-people-on-nhs-waiting-lists-in-england-at-record-high">waiting to start hospital treatment</a>. Whether this expansion can happen fast enough to be the only major change needed I don&rsquo;t know - I would assume not - but it&rsquo;s clearly a necessary step for the future.</p>
<p>A focus on domestic abuse and other violence against women, areas of crime that are unfortunately common and also very rarely prosecuted in many cases.</p>
<p>Creating of a publicly owned energy company - to facilitate the shift towards green energy, but also to create jobs, reduce dependence on countries such as Russia, build resilience and in the end lower fuel bills. I&rsquo;m happy Labour aren&rsquo;t scared to introduce policies that might be seen as being at least in the <em>direction</em> of nationalising parts of some critical industries, even if they have gone out of their way <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/great-british-energy-what-is-it-what-would-it-do-and-how-would-it-be-funded">to make it clear</a> that we&rsquo;re not talking about nationalising existing companies.</p>
<p>Taxing the vast profits of fossil fuel energy providers. This might prove somewhat impossible many cases when a lot of them are not British-situated companies. For those that are within the appropriate jurisdiction then it seems right to me to windfall-tax the profits of the energy producers which <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/05/oil-companies-massive-profits-first-quarter-russia-ukraine/">have been incredible</a> at a time when the cost of energy to consumers has created a real crisis.</p>
<p>Reforming the private rental sector - rents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/oct/21/private-rents-britain-hit-record-high-demand-properties">have never been higher</a>. A few years ago the Conservative MPs, many of whom are themselves landlords in addition to their day job(s), <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tories-vote-down-law-requiring-landlords-make-their-homes-fit-for-human-habitation-a6809691.html">voted against</a> requiring landlords to make their homes be &lsquo;fit for human habitation&rsquo;. Reforming could mean many things, but I expect most of them would be better than today&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<h2 id="some-of-the-things-i-felt-wary-about">Some of the things I felt wary about:</h2>
<p>A lot of the security section. &ldquo;Crack down on human traffickers&rdquo; is the sort of detail-free statement that always worries me on this topic.</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> mean creating compassionate policies to ensure people who want or need to get to the UK can do so in a safe and humane way to the benefit of us all. Or it could mean going full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">Farage</a> and inventing wave machines to literally push boats full of some of the most vulnerable people in the world back into the sea.</p>
<p>To be fair the latter idea was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12816615/home-office-wave-machine-migrants-channel/">dreamt up</a> (and thankfully discarded) under a Conservative administration - but I imagine Farage would also be into it. At least Labour&rsquo;s plans do specifically include cancelling the ridiculous and awful plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61097114">ship asylum seekers off to Rwanda</a>, which is a very good thing.</p>
<p>But, outside of that specific point, my fear is that is this &lsquo;cracking down&rsquo; will be more in the latter direction. Starmer <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/23073096.keir-starmer-admits-little-difference-immigration-labour-tories/">has specifically said</a> that there&rsquo;s very little substantive difference between his party&rsquo;s thinking on immigration and that of the Conservative Party. In a time where the official policy is to create a &lsquo;<a href="https://theconversation.com/hostile-environment-the-uk-governments-draconian-immigration-policy-explained-95460">hostile environment</a>&rsquo; in a way that may not even actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/25/hostile-environment-unlawful-ehrc-report-windrush-scandal-policy">be legal</a>, this is the kind of thing that I find abhorrent enough to be extremely off-putting. I couldn&rsquo;t defend it.</p>
<p>I was disappointed there was almost nothing about education. My understanding is that the education workforce is depleted, of low morale and struggling with workload in an environment of damaging low budgets in a similar way to the NHS workforce. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/11/teachers-england-plan-to-quit-workloads-stress-trust">A poll</a> suggested half of the teachers in England plan to quit within the next 5 years. Most experience various degrees of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/10/22/schools-and-mental-health-why-teachers-are-quitting-the-industry-17501832/?ico=zone-post-strip_item_1_news">poor mental health</a> due to their work. There&rsquo;s also the impact of the disruption to normal schooling practices on all concerned - students, teachers and parents - that the pandemic triggered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually have liked to see a specific mention of mental health in general. It&rsquo;s estimated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/england-second-pandemic-mental-health-issues-nhs-covid">an astonishing 10 million people in England</a> would benefit from new or extra mental health support.</p>
<p>I also wished I&rsquo;d seen something about international aid or other policies that support the wellbeing of people in other countries. Britain does not exist in isolation. Despite the frantic and damaging chaos resulting from recent UK political decisions, there remain countries that are in far worse states with their populations suffering solvable trauma. In some cases Britain may even have played an unfortunate part in creating the harms that they suffer. In all cases we should show them compassion.</p>

			 <p>Another day, another British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Now the UK is to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/24/sunak-poised-become-uk-pm-mordaunt-johnson-withdraw">led by Rishi Sunak</a> who was selected as Conservative Party leader without contest after his primary competitors dropped out.</p>

<p>Another pretty gripping season of this thriller, following DI Carey now she&rsquo;s been promoted into the shadowy S015 organisation she fought against in the first season.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t love it quite as much as <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/12/watched-season-of.html">that season</a> - perhaps because it felt even more implausible and confusing at times. A part of that might also be that some of the ethical issues it raises are less novel to me.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the extremely blatant references to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> (but in reality I think this stuff is far less effective than portrayed here - thankfully!) and tech companies like Huawei, alongside a reinforcement of the idea that modern-day politics is so much about presenting an &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; image.</p>

<p>One of my favourite albums of 2022 so far, from the Canadian punk rock band PUP.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think I read somewhere that the piano interludes were added just because they might annoy their fans, although I can&rsquo;t find the source for that any more. That sense of just having a fun time doing whatever nonsense you feel like doing makes the album extra compelling to me. I mean, how can you not love any album that contains a love song written from the point of view of a robot?</p>

<p>I went back and listened to their other 3 albums - <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1631000383">PUP</a>, <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1631000419">The Dream Is Over</a> and <a href="https://album.link/gb/i/1449065618">Morbid Stuff</a>. Each one was a good time.</p>

The sexism has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/30/never-mind-the-explosions-how-sexist-is-no-time-to-die">dialled down</a> vs some of the older films, but not in &ldquo;preachy&rdquo; way.

			 <p>So the UK has yet another <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/jeremy-hunt-named-as-new-chancellor-by-liz-truss/ar-AA12XEJS">new chancellor</a> - Jeremy Hunt - thanks to Liz Truss' latest enforced u-turn.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Conservative party continues to apparently be playing a game of randomly selecting economic strategies from a bag of policies totally unsuitable for the current economic situation, as we&rsquo;re likely heading back into a time of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/15/health-teaching-unions-jeremy-hunt-tory-austerity">deliberate austerity</a>.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that not only do unfathomable cuts to public services cause misery for the population - think for example of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/13/record-7-million-people-awaiting-hospital-treatment-says-nhs-england">7 million people currently on waitlists for hospital treatment</a> - they also kill us.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity">Austerity</a> policies naturally affect a lot more than healthcare expenditure, but it&rsquo;s perhaps there that their deadly effects can most clearly be estimated.</p>
<p>Last year researchers did their best to quantify the causal impact of constraining expenditure on social care, public health and healthcare in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/lost-decade-hidden-story-how-austerity-broke-britain">period of austerity</a> between 2010/2011–2014/2015. Their mean estimate was that the decrease in expenditure when compared with the trend for the 8 years before <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e046417">led to an extra 57.550 deaths</a> (albeit with a wide confidence interval - 3,075-111,195).</p>
<p>In modelling this, they concluded that an 1% increase in:</p>
<ul>
<li>healthcare expenditure reduces mortality by 0.532%;</li>
<li>social care expenditure reduces mortality by 0.336%;</li>
<li>local public health spending reduces mortality by 0.019%</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/11/e017722">different paper</a> from 5 years ago also attempted to look at the impact of us constraining healthcare and social care expenditure during 2011-2014. That group estimated an extra 45,368 people died  (95% CI 34,530-56,206) compared to trends before 2010. They suggest that investment in care homes and nurses are two important factors that could mitigate this.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ever since learning about the prevalence and progress of AI-generated art, mainly via such a piece having <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed">won an art competition</a>, it&rsquo;s not left my mind for too long.  I was <a href="https://dabblingwithdata.amedcalf.com/2022/09/04/should-artificial-intelligences-win-art-competitions/">kind of confused</a> how best to think about it then, and it&rsquo;s only got worse as time goes on. Herein are some further ramblings.</p>
<p>As a reminder, these are systems where you type in a prompt, e.g. &ldquo;Picture of a juggling elephant&rdquo; and out pops a picture of whatever you asked for. Right now the results aren&rsquo;t always great, hence the new vocation of &ldquo;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/so-you-want-to-be-a-prompt-engineer-critical-careers-of-the-future/">prompt engineer</a>&rdquo; - someone who knows what phrases to give to an AI for best result. But they&rsquo;re often certainly good enough to be used commercially and beyond.</p>
<p>There exist several famous such systems, including <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL-E</a>, <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a> and <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a>. Importantly, the way they work is dependent on them having processed vast arrays of existing, presumably human, art. This is typically sucked in from the internet without explicit permission from its creators. No-one really thinks computers just became innately artistic in the traditional sense; but rather that we developed algorithms that allow a computer to translate an arbitrary text string into an image output based on what it&rsquo;s derived from all the art and contextual information it&rsquo;s already seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jun/09/what-exactly-is-ai-generated-art-how-does-it-work-will-it-replace-human-visual-artists">This Guardian article</a> gives a quick overview of roughly how these systems work. The below video goes through some slightly more mathy details.

<p>Given the genie is well and truly out of the bottle, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable that we&rsquo;ll see more and more usage of AI art over time. The systems are already perfectly usable by almost anyone who can use the web, and will only get cheaper and easier to use over time - for an individual end user even now it&rsquo;s often free. If nothing else, we can be confident that the capitalism&rsquo;s invisible hand typically pushes us towards the immediately cheapest - often meaning most generic and least human-skill-requiring - solution to any perceived need, no matter the external cost. You&rsquo;d basically need some kind of world-wide usage ban to stop it, which isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be a set of people who are dead against the technology. It may well never replace human artists in their entirety.  But it&rsquo;s going to - and perhaps already has - replace a good number of them. In doing so, it&rsquo;ll inevitably change what the world looks like for the rest of us.</p>
<p>After all, even if it turns out that the very &lsquo;best&rsquo; art is somehow only ever possible via human production, there&rsquo;s a ton of current use cases where fairly mediocre art is acceptable to businesses and individuals. Particularly when it&rsquo;s extremely cheap to produce.</p>
<p>Automation replacing people in jobs is very much <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/01/19/understanding-the-impact-of-automation-on-workers-jobs-and-wages/">not new</a>, but it&rsquo;s traditionally been seen un jobs with perhaps less visible output, considered more rote, and unfortunately probably thought of as being of lower status or worth than the typical romantic perception of the artist. Being an artist is aspirational, if sadly unobtainable, for many folk. That&rsquo;s not to say there aren&rsquo;t plenty of unpleasant, tedious, <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/chances-success-arts-21st-century/">ill-paid and abusive artistic jobs</a>. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be terrible if some of those disappear, as long as the people involved are cared for. But the trait of being &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; is often seen as a very human, and desirable trait. Those considered to be near the top of their game are widely admired and honoured.</p>
<p>Whilst access to AI art generators is somewhat restricted or at least niche at present, that&rsquo;s inevitably not going be the case for long. Microsoft Office, that most unexciting and ubiquitous of workplace software, is gearing up to add  a &ldquo;<a href="https://designer.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Designer</a>&rdquo; component that generates illustrations based on the sentences you type. Their promo video shows someone creating a poster for their bakery business based on typing &ldquo;Cake with berries, bread and pastries for the fall&rdquo;, no graphic designer needed. I guess this is the modern day version of clipart.</p>

<p>Stock photography as a business might also be on its way out, at least in terms of how it works today. Already there are stock photography sites that <a href="(https://www.stockai.com/)">offer to generate you an AI-created image</a> if they don&rsquo;t already have something that meets your satisfaction. That&rsquo;s one less human photographer or artist receiving credit and payment for their work. In fact one of that site&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.stockai.com/tools/article-to-featured-image">dedicated tools</a> reads your blog post text to create you an appropriate cover image. I might try that on this post just for fun when I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Update: I did just that. Here&rsquo;s the image <a href="https://www.stockai.com/">stockai.com</a> generated when fed with the text from this post. It was free and took maybe 45 seconds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of how the technology could be additive rather than substitutional. There&rsquo;s no way I would have commissioned an artist or even browsed stock photography sites for this humble blogpost. No-one lost out (at least not <em>directly</em>, certainly the consequences of participating in shifting norms are debatable). But it also seems very unlikely that many profit-focussed companies who currently invest in some kind of artistic output will keep spending the money they currently do if they get idea that they don&rsquo;t need to into their heads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/">The Atlantic</a> magazine already got into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/ai-art-artificial-intelligence-midjourney-dall-e-replacing-artists">some controversy</a> over using an AI generated image to illustrate one of its newsletters. <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover">used an AI</a> to design one of its covers. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more examples, whether we know about them or not. Let&rsquo;s also remember than an increasing number of the more mundane stories you <em>read</em> in certain publications are written by AIs - the <a href="https://www.techslang.com/how-is-automated-journalism-impacting-the-media/">automated journalism</a> trend, so it&rsquo;s not only visual creativity at play here.</p>
<p>But worrying about people losing jobs due to technology is seemingly not something society tends to do in earnest. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddites</a> who literally battled the industrialisation of the textile business in 19th century England didn&rsquo;t win; they became an insult.</p>
<p>Sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about it, they&rsquo;ll just get better jobs right away&rdquo; or &ldquo;but this will make things cheaper which will benefit everyone in the end&rdquo; abound. Sometimes they might be true. Oftentimes probably the former isn&rsquo;t, at least whilst many of us live in societies that tend to see unemployment as a problem that must be solved by the individual rather than the system that caused it, whilst appearing to have little respect for article 25 of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. But <em>in theory</em> we could deal humanely and generously with unemployment of all kinds.</p>
<p>What is less obvious to me is what a shift to most &ldquo;art&rdquo; we see day-to-day being generated by AI might do to harder-to-define concepts like creativity. The pictures that come out of these AI machines are &ldquo;new&rdquo; for sure, in that they never existed before. But they&rsquo;re all based on some black-box manipulation of existing, human-powered art for now. Some of this is very clear, such as prompts that explicitly request the combination of 2 human artworks that haven&rsquo;t previously been combined - such as &ldquo;Kermit the Frog in Blade Runner 2049&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In other, more abstract cases, it&rsquo;s much less obvious.</p>
<p>But in any case, the machine needs feeding.</p>
<p>One might consider that human artists are also inspired by what they&rsquo;ve seen. To what extent is a human&rsquo;s art also a black box &ldquo;generative process&rdquo; based on all the artistic inputs they&rsquo;ve seen in their life? There&rsquo;s an way in which this has to be at least partly true within a certain scope, given &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_movement">movements</a>&rdquo; exist in art - think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">Impressionism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism">Modernism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism">Neo-Classicism</a>, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But something starts those movements. What I don&rsquo;t know is whether that&rsquo;s something qualitatively different to the kind of generative process that the crop of AI art generators we might expect in the next few years could do. Or am I putting humanity on too much of a pedestal? Do we know that human creativity isn&rsquo;t deep down based on a not dissimilar process? Disclaimer: I haven&rsquo;t actually done any research into creativity really. There may exist very simple answers to these questions.</p>
<p>But if there is an insurmountable difference, or simply if market forces et. al.  result in AIs being attuned towards a diminutive and limiting goal like &ldquo;optimise your output to please the most amount of people today&rdquo; then perhaps something will be lost, or at least delayed. Will future historians note a moment where the world got artistically stuck in some sense?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of course possible I&rsquo;ve gotten this the wrong way round. An <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/">AI playing the game of Go</a> beat its human opponent with moves so novel and unexpected that they&rsquo;ve been described as &lsquo;alien&rsquo; and &lsquo;from an alternate dimension&rsquo;. Maybe one day AI art generators will show us something valuable we&rsquo;d never otherwise have imagined.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the more concerning &ldquo;getting stuck&rdquo; effect has already happened to some extent via a different algorithmic use case. Witness for instance how Netflix has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/netflix-cancelled-series-soundtrack-tuca-and-bertie-chambers-spinning-out-mindhunter-a9365501.html">changed its once acclaimed artistic output</a> based on what it&rsquo;s algorithms say will sell well. Look at the truly bizarre output that sometimes populates social media at present, where potentially artistic output gets optimised for engagement above anything. It might result in fascinating, important, meaningful new art forms. It can also result in a spate of videos of people <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/eating-ice-cream-out-of-a-toilet">eating out of toilets</a> because at some point someone did it and the resulting video went viral.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear how &ldquo;new&rdquo; this is; I&rsquo;m sure art has always been driven by incentive. It may just be that accessibility and access to an audiences improved. It&rsquo;s much easier for me to share a video of myself eating ice-cream out of a toilet on Facebook than it would be for me to paint some kind of Mona Lisa-beating painting and set up an internationally renowned art gallery to show it off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often easy to forget that just because something is difficult doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo;. That sentiment is often a metaphorical barrier used to prohibit less privileged sections of  society making inroads into whatever sphere the existing powers-that-be want to protect for their own selfish purposes.</p>
<p>A little less dramatically: should my blog go without illustration because I don&rsquo;t have either the talent or resources needed to go to art school?  But also, if I&rsquo;m not prepared to pay or credit an artist then do I really have the right to use an illustration that was overtly non-consensually derived from work of many other people? As these systems work by ingesting incredible amounts of other people&rsquo;s art, a whole set of rights issues exist.</p>
<p>Being popular with the current AI art community is not necessarily a blessing for a human artist. <a href="https://www.artstation.com/rutkowski">Greg Rutkowski</a>  is an artist known for fantasy landscapes. But his style is liked enough that his name has apparently <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/">become a common prompt</a> for people using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney to generate art, with tens of thousands of images being generated by typing in phrases including his name.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/">example shown by the MIT Technology Review</a> used the prompt <em>“Wizard with sword and a glowing orb of magic fire fights a fierce dragon Greg Rutkowski&quot;</em> which produced this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now when Rutkowski Googles his name he gets art that isn&rsquo;t his. And he has no rights over the AI-generated images. So if some entity wants to use some work that an AI explicitly created   based on having ingested hundreds of his images without permission then they&rsquo;re presumably free to do so. This has understandably <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/a-i-should-exclude-living-artists-from-its-database-says-one-painter-whose-works-were-used-to-fuel-image-generators-2178352">left him with the opinion</a> that &ldquo;A.I. should exclude living artists from its database&rdquo;.  Which prompts me to additionally wonder about if there&rsquo;s any ethical considerations of note surrounding the possible AI exploitation of a <em>dead</em> artist&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>For now though, if the artist&rsquo;s images are on the internet then they&rsquo;re considered fair game. These systems don&rsquo;t ask artists to opt in to having their work included, and it&rsquo;s not clear that they even have the ability to opt out them. Some tools that at might at least let you know if your work has been used to train these AI systems have started to appear, including <a href="https://haveibeentrained.com/">Spawn&rsquo;s Have I Been Trained?</a>.</p>
<p>To what extent this is different from a human artist enjoying Rutkowski&rsquo;s pictures and later creating something in a similar style is something that perhaps still needs to be thrashed out. After all, the ingested pictures were on the publicly accessible internet in the first place. But the big difference here is of course accessibility and scale. The new part is that is that a single person or business with no art knowledge or skill can generate hundreds of &ldquo;original&rdquo; Rutkowski style pictures a day with no artistic ability and little-to-no resources.</p>
<p>This opens up new possibilities for the masses, which could be a positive thing - see <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-ai-makes-art/">the optimistic possibility Wired presents</a> of &ldquo;dramatically expanding the number of people able to generate and experiment with art and illustration&rdquo;. But left without consideration, it may also result in a pretty devastating exploitation of people&rsquo;s hitherto highly valued work. And potentially a world where it feels like we&rsquo;re immersed in some kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Borges' style Library of Babel</a> but for whichever genre of art is algorithmically popular or convenient, with a possible plot twist of any remaining human artists <a href="https://twitter.com/OnTheGranblue/status/1578632039326441472">being accused of being AIs</a>.</p>

			 <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02012-w">new paper</a> examining the links between the average daily step count (as measured by Fitbit) and the health outcomes of ~6,000 people reinforces the idea that being more active is good for our health in many dimensions.</p>
<p>Steps per day negatively correlated with obesity, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One takeaway I&rsquo;d have is that in general more is always better, at least up to the thresholds displayed on the chart. There&rsquo;s nothing special about the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/10000-steps-rule/590785/">(in?)famous 10k steps a day goal</a> in many of these curves. So an increase in physical activity is likely worthwhile irrespective of whether you&rsquo;re going from 2,000 to 3,000 steps, or 9.000 to 10,000.</p>
<p>That said, being observational, the study cannot truly prove that the increased steps is what <em>caused</em> the better health outcomes, although the authors do attempt to reduce the risk of reverse causation (i.e. good health leads to more steps) . Studies like these also cannot truly control for every possible confounder.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, whilst the conclusion isn&rsquo;t exactly surprising, it&rsquo;s nice to see a study that looked at a reasonably high number of people over a reasonably long time frame - the median step-monitoring period being 4 years -  and made an effort to control for various external confounders.</p>

			 <p>The Truss administration&rsquo;s obsessive and damaging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/04/liz-truss-energy-prices-action-plan">focus on reducing taxes</a>, particularly for the wealthy and corporations, at any cost has led to her policies being eviscerated by all sorts of organisations and individuals, including many people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/its-extraordinary-liz-trusss-low-tax-gamble-has-yet-to-convince-tory-mps">from her own party</a>.</p>
<p>The irony, according to <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/reforms-roll-outs-and-freezes-tax-and-benefit-system">an analysis </a>by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is that the average household will actually end up paying <em>more</em> tax overall, due to the Conservative&rsquo;s stated policy of freezing the thresholds at which we start to pay income tax for four years, alongside many other tax and benefit related thresholds.</p>
<p>Of course due to inflation - and we have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12196322">a lot of that</a> at the moment - keeping the threshold at which tax is due to the same nominal amount means that more people reach that threshold without them having achieved any additional real spending power. But &ldquo;quietly freeze things as they are&rdquo; is a much less attention grabbing policy than &ldquo;make wild cuts to specific things&rdquo; so the effects might not be as well-known as other parts of their catastrophic <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/havent-thoroughly-dug.html">mini-budget</a>.</p>
<p>The IFS analysis suggests that by 2025-2, 1.4 million more people will be paying income tax, costing basic-rate tax payers an extra £500 per year.</p>
<p>1.6 million more people will be paying higher-rate tax, which will cost them about £3,000 extra per year.</p>
<p>An extra 125k people will be affected by the benefit cap, and 500k more families will lose some or all of their child benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;on average for every £1 households gain from high-profile cuts to rates of income tax and National Insurance, they lose £2 from the freezes and policy roll-outs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst literally every income decile will see negative effects to their income, it nets out in a regressive way with the poorest section of society seeing a 2.8% reduction of income, vs 1.1% for the richest.</p>

			 <p>Just to add further confusion to my <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/10/05/should-i-use.html">plastic recycling dilemma</a>, the <a href="https://www.ciwm.co.uk/">Chartered Institution of Wastes Management</a> has <a href="https://www.ciwm.co.uk/ciwm/news/2022/ciwm_statement_in_response_to_i_paper_article.aspx">responded</a> to the claim of &ldquo;a lot of your plastic recycling ends up in the Asian sea&rdquo; by claiming that&rsquo;s misinformation, as under 3% of UK plastic recycling is exported to that region and almost none goes to India or the Philippines.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees though that the most effective measure is to not create the waste in the first place.</p>

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/10/05/should-i-use.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-10-05 18:33:47 &#43;0100">Oct 5, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Just after I&rsquo;ve upped my plastic recycling game after reading <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/25/book-notes-turning.html">a book about the horrors of excess plastic</a>, I read <a href="https://inews.co.uk/opinion/landfill-better-recycled-plastic-ends-up-sea-1891207">an article</a> suggesting that it might all be even more in vain than the book suggested.</p>
<p>The way &ldquo;rich&rdquo; countries like the UK often deal with the waste they&rsquo;ve collected for recycling is not to actually recycle it themselves, but rather just palm it off to any other poorer country that can be exploited to accept it. Then the receiving country has to figure out how to actually deal with it.</p>
<p>But some of these countries are not all that fastidious at ensuring the waste goes where it should. Thus a lot of this plastic we think we&rsquo;ve sent for recycling actually ends up littering the environment, particularly the sea, anyway.</p>
<p>The author cites <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922003512?via%3Dihub">a model</a> that suggests that 6,000 of the 37,000 tons of plastic packaging the Netherlands exports each year, mostly to Asia, actually ends up in the marine environment.</p>
<p>Apparently British landfills are fairly good at keeping in what&rsquo;s deposited in them, if nothing else. So perhaps the real choice we have is between putting waste plastic in the recycle bin knowing that a good amount of it will end up polluting the sea anyway, vs putting it in the general waste bin knowing that it&rsquo;ll be stuck alongside vast mass of landfill forever - but that&rsquo;s a relatively &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and contained place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure which the best option is! Both the afore-mentioned book and this article reinforce it&rsquo;s far more effective to reduce the amount of plastic that&rsquo;s created in the first place, as opposed to keep making it with the hope that it&rsquo;ll be recycled.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781473574922">A Book Of Secrets</a> by Derren Brown 📚.</p>
<p>Philosophical meanderings on how one can frame the ups and downs of life so as to best cope with the journey. It extolls the development of a universal sense of absurdity and melancholy, alongside an appreciation of the growth that coming up against friction can bring. And that there&rsquo;s really no point in trying to hide the facets of ourselves we don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think it may be especiallly poignant for anyone going through something like a mid-life crisis - if nothing else to understand that even extremely famous and successful people have the same feelings of doubt, frustration and maybe even horror that the rest of us do. It&rsquo;s a very universal experience.</p>

			 <p>The design for new coins featuring King Charles III <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63073983?at_custom4=7065BBC8-4085-11ED-94D0-40A096E8478F&amp;at_custom1=link&amp;at_campaign=64&amp;at_custom2=twitter&amp;at_custom3=Regional+BBC+London&amp;at_medium=custom7">has been  released</a>. Within a few weeks we should see 50p coins with his head on them, although the Queen Elizabeth coins will still be perfectly usable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In case you&rsquo;re wondering why it feels like he&rsquo;s facing the wrong way, then it turns out that&rsquo;s actually tradition. Each time we get a new monarch, the coin design flips such that they alternate from facing left to right and so on. We just haven&rsquo;t had a new monarch within almost anyone&rsquo;s living memory.</p>
<p>This has been the case since the 1600s, only broken at the request of King Edward VIII. Although even that was mainly a theoretical breach for anyone outside of specialist coin collectors, because no coins got into general circulation before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication_of_Edward_VIII">he abdicated</a>.</p>
<p>This also explains why Queen Elizabeth <a href="https://www.mylondon.news/whats-on/whats-on-news/queens-head-faces-right-coins-17520861">faced left on stamps but right on coins</a>. The convention for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stamps has been for the monarch to always face left, whereas she happened to be on the looking-right phase of the coin schedule.</p>
<p>Likewise kings typically <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-09-30/the-subtle-ways-the-new-king-charles-coin-will-be-different-from-the-queens">do not wear crowns in their coin portraits</a>, whereas queens do.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/28/the-next-uk.html">The next UK crisis: mortgage payments?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Mortgage payments look to be one of the next crises the UK is going to have to stare into the existential void of, or do something about.</p>
<p>Not content with folk being unable to afford food to eat or energy to heat, it seems like housing may be the next to go. Even for those people who are rich or lucky enough to be mortgaged home owners - in many places <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-its-more-difficult-for-young-people-to-buy-a-house-now-than-it-was-fifty-years-ago-12537254">it&rsquo;s been nearly impossible</a> for first time buyers to get onto the housing ladder in the first place.</p>
<p>As the British economy appears to destroy itself in reaction to the Conservative&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/23/kwarteng-accused-of-reckless-mini-budget-for-the-rich-as-pound-crashes">bewildering and reckless mini-budget</a>, the Bank of England has felt compelled to raise interest rates. This has many consequences, but of note here is the fact that many mortgages are directly linked to the BoE interest rate. Those that aren&rsquo;t are likely influenced by it, at least at the time of taking out the loan.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/the-interest-rate-bank-rate">Bank of England&rsquo;s web page</a> shows how the interest rate has changed over the past decade.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So it&rsquo;s been very low, under than 1% for most of the decade, but has already shot up to more than double that figure recently. But that&rsquo;s not where it&rsquo;s likely to stop.  The markets are apparently pricing in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england">an expected rate of 6%</a> for next year.</p>
<p>This certainly isn&rsquo;t historically unprecedented - the rate was last 6% back in 1999, and it was more than double that a decade before. But people have obviously been taking out mortgages - and companies have been offering them - based on the situation in contemporary times rather than the state of the world 20 years ago. Even if a consumer  did proactively try and integrate future interest rate considerations into their mortgage decision they wouldn&rsquo;t have been saved; just a few months ago the projected interest rate for next year was just a quarter of what it seems like it may turn out to be.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/22/what-does-the-banks-interest-rate-hike-mean-for-peoples-financesr">about 2.2 million people on variable rate mortgages</a>, who are likely to be affected in the short term. About 3 times as many people currently hold fixed rate mortgages so are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the short term, but as soon as they come to the end of their fixed rate - usually 2 or 5 years after they took the mortgage out -  they will end up in the same disaster-laden boat.</p>
<p>The consequential differences in the monthly payments homeowners will be required to make are not small! Unfortunately a rise of 1 percentage point in the bank rate doesn&rsquo;t mean your payments get 1% larger. For mortgages that follow the Bank of England rate, the interest rate relates to that of your debt. I&rsquo;m sure many of us have been schooled about the miracle of compound interest when it comes to savings. Unfortunately the same applies to debt.</p>
<p>Various articles have given some example calculations. A tweet from economist Samuel Tombs calculated that the average household looking to refinance a 2 year fix next year would need to find £627 extra a month.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Others examples quoted by <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/sinking-pound-sterling-mortgage-debt-interest-rates-123320628.html">Yahoo Finance</a> include someone with a £140k mortgage that went from 2.25% to 6% would need to pay an additional £270 a month.</p>
<p>You can choose your own example using one of the many mortgage calculators, such as the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator/">one from MoneySavingExpert</a>.</p>
<p>With that for example you can see that  you&rsquo;d taken out £150k over 25 years at say 1.5%, that&rsquo;s a monthly payment of £600. The same borrowing at next year&rsquo;s expected interest rate of 6% would cost you £967 a month.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the state of affairs is in such disarray that <a href="https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/mortgages/which-lenders-have-removed-their-mortgages-thus-far/">985 mortgage products were withdrawn</a> from sale overnight, with some banks and building societies entirely stopping offering mortgages to new customers.</p>

<p>As well as the much needed environmental impact, the hope is that it&rsquo;ll also create a whole lot of jobs, and make energy bills permanently lower, as well as make the UK less dependent on Putin et al.</p>

<p>Given the most immediate problem to solve is along the lines of poorer people not having enough money to heat their homes or eat, this seems to be the kind of outcome only a cartoon supervillain would think was a goer.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1573238484126638080">Jim Pickard</a> confirmed that the removal of the 45p income tax rate gives away an average of £10,000 to the top 629,000 earners. <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/1573303311381430272">James Ball notes</a> that if there&rsquo;s that much spare money on offer it could instead have been used to give every single household with an income of less than £20k an extra £1000 each.</p>
<p>Luckily most of the public realise this, <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/09/23/bdbb2/3">according to YouGov</a>, with 63% of respondents realising the wealthy would benefit more (with most of the rest saying they aren&rsquo;t sure either way).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Under the Trump administration, the US instantiated policies aimed to reduce the number of refugee and asylum seekers settling in their country between 2017 and 2020.</p>
<p>It seems like the policies <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/27/under-trump-us-no-longer-leads-world-on-refugee-protections/">were fairly &ldquo;successful&rdquo;</a>, with a decrease in annual US refugee arrivals <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/economic-and-fiscal-effects-united-states-reduced-numbers-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.pdf">by 86% between 2016 and 2020</a>, alongside a drop in successful applications for asylum of <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/economic-and-fiscal-effects-united-states-reduced-numbers-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.pdf">around 68% between 2017 and 2019</a>. I don&rsquo;t know enough about the subject to know how much of this was down to the policies themselves, but the numbers certainly went in the direction the leadership wanted.</p>
<p>However, contrary to many lay-people&rsquo;s intuitions, there&rsquo;s a reasonable consensus amongst economists that, in their role as &ldquo;economic actors&rdquo;, immigrants are on average net positive for the receiving country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All are consumers, most are (or become) workers, and many are (or become) investors. All incur fiscal costs by using public services directly or indirectly, and all generate fiscal revenue either directly or indirectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/38/3/449/6701682?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">A recently published paper</a> by Michael Clemens examines the specific effect of  the afore-mentioned decrease in asylum and refugee admissions along these lines.  It concludes that the the reduction in admissions now costs the US economy more than $9.1 billion per year, and the government itself has lost out more than $2 billion. These costs will keep accruing as time goes on because the population that would have generated this extra economic activity is simply not present.</p>
<p>His model suggests that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;relative to 2019 levels, a 10 percent reduction in refugee resettlement to the United States likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than $1.4 billion, and a loss to public coffers (federal, state, and local) of more than $310 million, cumulatively over the  subsequent five years.</p>
<p>Turning to asylum seekers: A 10 percent reduction in affirmative and defensive asylum seekers likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than $8.9 billion, and a loss to public coffers of more than $1.5 billion, cumulatively over the subsequent five years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst I certainly don&rsquo;t think the primary driver of asylum policy should be economic - a basic moral concern for other people should surely be paramount - the fact that imposing barriers to this form of migration imposes serious and potentially permanent economic costs on one&rsquo;s own country seems like something that should be present in the consciousness of the public and the decision makers.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/18/if-disney-somehow.html">If Disney did ruin The Little Mermaid then it was 33 years ago</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/18/if-disney-somehow.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-18 17:26:48 &#43;0100">Sep 18, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this month Disney released a trailer for their upcoming film &ldquo;The Little Mermaid&rdquo;.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-wPm99PF9U" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Of course it caused a certain amount of uproar on some of the less savoury parts of the internet (such as Youtube) based on the claim that Disney somehow ruined it by being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. As noted in a <a href="https://www.readtpa.com/p/the-little-mermaid">recent edition</a> of <a href="https://www.readtpa.com/">The Present Age&rsquo;s </a>newsletter, given the lack of dialogue or really anything other than swimming in the sea action, this basically means that people don&rsquo;t like the fact that a Black actress, Halle Bailey, was cast in the role of Ariel.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising, not least because the <a href="https://www.insider.com/halle-bailey-responds-to-little-mermaid-backlash-2019-8">same rants and raves happened</a> upon the announcement of the casting 3 years ago, and the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to have improved much in that respect since then. I guess the people in question just forgot they&rsquo;d already made that particular angry attempt to cancel Disney.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the more glaring confirmations of what is going on here was when a Twitter user shared the results of &ldquo;using AI&rdquo; to <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2022/09/twitter-bans-weirdo-who-shared-racist-video-changing-halle-baileys-ariel-from-black-to-white/">convert a still from the trailer</a> from featuring the original Halle Bailey to a fake white person, commenting that it was possible to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the entire movie like than in 24 hours. It is apparently, to quote the poster in question, &ldquo;over for wokecels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trying to abstract the topic away from what is hard to read as anything other than simple racism,  I think Adam Serwer, in his Atlantic article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-fantasy-sci-fi-racist-criticism/671421/">Fear of a Black Hobbit</a>&rdquo; is right in saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demand to keep politics out of art is too often a demand for art to conform to conservative politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what extent does truly apolitical art exist? I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;can you make a film that isn&rsquo;t <em>about</em> politics?&rdquo; - of course you can. But it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine many films that aren&rsquo;t touched by society and politics one way or another.</p>
<p>If what is really meant is &ldquo;I want films that resemble the ones that used to be made in my society 30 years ago&rdquo; then those films will naturally have been influenced the society and politics at the time. Nothing is born into a cultural vacuum. Even if one can find a story that can&rsquo;t be interpreted &ldquo;politically&rdquo; then there&rsquo;s still the considerations of who created the art, under what circumstances, why they chose that particular story, what their intent was with it and why they, as opposed to someone else, were the one to tell it.</p>
<p>If one wants a specific example of this then we can look at the various ways that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_appearance_of_Jesus">Jesus has been portrayed</a> over time. All sorts of skin colours have been used. Many detailed and vigorous debates have been had as to which is the ‘correct’ one. And this is for an actual person for whom the consensus is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus">they likely did exist</a> as a historical figure - so there is an actual true answer to know in theory.</p>
<p>On which note, the backlash to the The Little Mermaid&rsquo;s casting is a particularly wild and confusing phenomenon if taken at the surface level. For one, I&rsquo;m sorry if this traumatises anyone, but mermaids are mythical beings. We&rsquo;re not misrepresenting some fact of nature. How we choose to portray these folkloric beings is up to us.</p>
<p>Secondly, the colour of Ariel&rsquo;s skin is totally irrelevant to the story. It&rsquo;s more about whether she has a fish tail or not.</p>
<p>Where skin colour is a pivotal aspect to the story of course it often makes sense to preserve that in whichever way the story requires. Likewise if you’re trying to recreate an actual historical event as accurately as possible. Switching the races of the actors in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349662/">BlackkKlansman</a> would be pretty nonsensical given its topic and basis in real life. The story of a fictional creature living in a fictional world where their salient experience is dependent on whether they have a fish tail or human legs does not have this limiting factor.</p>
<p>In reality, even a writer who wants to tell stories about race has many degrees of freedom. Science fiction for example contains many stories about social prejudice and discrimination paralleling racism but set in an entirely different looking and behaving world populated with distant aliens.  Experimenting with other identities can work similarly - Naomi Alderman&rsquo;s famous book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power">The Power</a>&rdquo; explores a future where women become a physical threat to men, as opposed to the current world where the opposite is usually true.</p>
<p>Next up, well, Black mermaids are nothing new even within the canon of Disney-specific Little Mermaid productions. Disney has had them for three decades. You&rsquo;ve somewhat missed the boat on umm&hellip;&ldquo;proving&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Introducing Gabriella, from 1992&rsquo;s Disney&rsquo;s Little Mermaid TV series:</p>
<figure><img src="/uploads/2022/65b44cb50a.png"
         alt="Image from the Mermaid Wiki"/><figcaption>
            <p>Image from the <a href="https://mermaid.fandom.com/wiki/Gabriella">Mermaid Wiki</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unlike most Disney mermaids, Gabriella was actually based on a real person, albeit not one with a tail.  Her design was inspired by 2 year-old Gabriella Bommino who unfortunately died of leukaemia so young, but was already a Little Mermaid superfan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t if this choice caused any consternation in 1992 to be honest. I hope not. But Twitter and YouTube weren&rsquo;t a thing back then so perhaps it was more containable if it existed at all.</p>
<p>Moving on: is there really a danger of ruining the purity (?) of the Little Mermaid by &ldquo;introducing politics&rdquo;? As noted above, so many - perhaps all - stories are already touched or contextualised by politics and society. But it seems to me that the Little Mermaid is particularly easy to interpret using political and social metaphors. Many people have done so, years before last week&rsquo;s trailer came out.</p>
<p>Whilst some may now find aspects of Disney&rsquo;s original 1989 film interpretation of The Little Mermaid <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-little-mermaid_b_1694342">problematic</a>, the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/little-mermaid-was-way-more-subversive-you-realized-180973464/">Smithsonian Magazine wrote</a> in some detail about the political subversion embedded within it at the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last thing Americans would expect from Disney was a critique of patriarchy, but sure enough, Ashman’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em> is a gutsy film about gender and identity—a far cry from the staid Disney catalog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenika Cruz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/the-little-mermaid-at-25-and-the-evolving-definition-of-strong-female/382581/">writing in the Atlantic</a> saw it as a &ldquo;stepping stone&rdquo; for Disney from a set of animations with few female leads (and those that did feature were often asleep for most of the film - think Snow White or Sleeping Beauty) to the more rounded, well-developed female cartoon stars of recent years.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, there has been many an interpretation of the original story, for example as an allegory for growing up, as a commentary on identity or a metaphor for gender relations. After all, poor repressed Ariel believes the only way she can be happy is to marry a rich man, so feels compelled to change her appearance, giving up her treasured voice in an effort to do so. I haven&rsquo;t got access to the essay, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid#Themes_and_interpretations">Wikipedia</a> describes <a href="https://experts.arizona.edu/en/publications/split-skins-female-agency-and-bodily-mutilation-in-the-little-mer">Susan White&rsquo;s interpretation of the story</a> as the &ldquo;difficult liminal passage of the girl into the order of speech and social symbolism (power, politics, and agency) which is symbolically understood as masculine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is even more salient when we remember that the Disney movie in many ways does not actually reflect the original story. If Disney is to be held at fault for changing the original then perhaps it&rsquo;d make a little more sense to be cross at them for entirely changing the ending and, to some people, the whole point of the story 33 years ago. For the &ldquo;anti-wokers&rdquo;, surely casting a person that doesn&rsquo;t look exactly like your mental image of Ariel is nothing compared making up a whole new soppy ending, perhaps fearing that the snowflake audience can&rsquo;t cope with the original.</p>
<p>For people, like me as of 2 days ago, who don&rsquo;t know the original story, brace yourself - it&rsquo;s not pretty.</p>
<p>First we discover that, unlike the story&rsquo;s humans, mermaids are mere creatures; they don&rsquo;t have souls. Human souls go to heaven for eternity when they die. Mermaids simply turn into foam and cease to exist. As well as questing for the love of the handsome prince, what Ariel is battling for is to complete herself with a soul.</p>
<p>The witch still gives Ariel the magic turn-tail-into-legs potion in exchange for her voice. But in the original, drinking it is physically agonising. Walking on her resulting legs feels like walking on sharp knives from that point on.</p>
<p>The conditionality is also more severe. If Ariel can&rsquo;t make the prince love her then the day after he marries someone else, Ariel will die. In that case she will also never have become a full human, so will die soulless, vanishing from existence entirely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the prince marries someone else.</p>
<p>But all is not lost; Ariel&rsquo;s sisters negotiate with the witch, swapping their lovely hair for a knife they give to Ariel. Ariel must use this knife to murder the prince. Only when his blood drips on her feet the witch will let her return to her original mermaid life. Grim.</p>
<p>Despite the personal consequences, she can&rsquo;t bring herself to do this so commits suicide, throwing herself into the sea and dissolving into foam as expected. But at the last minute she&rsquo;s kind of saved: rather than vanishing into nothingness forever she&rsquo;s been turned into a spirit - a &ldquo;daughter of the air&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s still a glimmer of hope for her to get into heaven, but for now she&rsquo;s stuck in purgatory for 300 years, and must try and prove herself worthy by doing good deeds for mankind.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been something of an anti-monarchist every since I can remember, primarily based on the general idea that holding the privilege and powers associated with the office, both explicit and implicit should not be something that someone gets based on who their parents happened to be and whether their ancestors won a battle hundreds of years ago. There are also convincing arguments that the institution is expensive, unaccountable, and so on.</p>
<p>To me, the UK has really just been lucky that for so long we&rsquo;ve had a queen, that at least as far as I know (which is not all that far),  in recent times has been a committed, principled and dutiful holder of the post, not being unduly meddlesome or inflammatory. Quite the opposite, you&rsquo;ll not find too many hot takes on the <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily">Royal Family&rsquo;s Twitter account</a>. It feels sad that she has left us, irrespective of whether or not the institution itself is valid. But it&rsquo;s a bit of a risky proposition to say that all future holders of the crown will be of a similar type.</p>
<p>The usual &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; argument I have heard about in favour of the British monarchy is, sure, they cost money, but they also generate a lot via for instance tourism. I haven&rsquo;t looked into it in any detail, but given most tourists don&rsquo;t get to meet the queen or king themselves, I wonder how we go about separating the specific impact of the power structure of the monarchy and the people involved from the more available parts of the associated tourism; the fancy buildings, soldiers dressed up in unusual costumes, museums full of jewelry, the history and mythology and so on, all of which could exist without a formal monarch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ianleslie.substack.com/p/being-the-queen">recent edition</a> of<a href="https://ianleslie.substack.com/"> Ian Leslie&rsquo;s newsletter</a> provided a take I&rsquo;d not really considered before. It seems inspired in part from <a href="https://twitter.com/jhallwood/status/1568149860628533248">an essay</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Attlee">Clement Atlee</a>  - yes, that same socialist Prime Minister, beloved by some of the British left, no flag-waving conservative here! - who wrote that &ldquo;I have never been a republican even in theory, and certainly not in practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie (and Atlee) note that, as irrational and hierarchical as the system of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> may be, several countries that are widely acknowledged to have <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3043576/the-10-countries-with-the-highest-national-well-being">high levels</a> of both wellbeing and relative equality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy#List_of_current_constitutional_monarchies">have one</a> - think of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. That&rsquo;s not to say this style of monarchy <em>causes</em> these good outcomes, but it clearly doesn&rsquo;t prevent them, and perhaps may even be positively associated with them.</p>
<p>Why do they appear to work well? Leslie argues that the unavoidable irrationality of bestowing power and finery upon someone predicated solely on who their parents are may be  part of the attraction - &ldquo;they speak to the heart as well as the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humans are not purely rational beings, and perhaps the &ldquo;sentimental loyalty&rdquo; humans are prone to is better to be absorbed by a monarch than left to be picked up by the leader of a faction, with Atlee citing Hitler, Mussolini and de Gaulle as contenders. To the extent that a constitutional monarchy isn&rsquo;t the obvious centre of day-to-day power in practice, perhaps it&rsquo;s safer and more uniting to have irrational sentimentality directed that way.</p>
<p>The fact that the queen didn&rsquo;t have to fight for votes in an election (or, to at least some extent popularity in the media) gave her the ability to not become part of any major argument. There are plenty of people who aren&rsquo;t a fan of the monarchy in principle, but nonetheless the queen did seem to be able to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/sky-high-public-approval-for-the-queen-ahead-of-platinum-jubilee">unite swathes of people</a> in a way that it&rsquo;s almost inconceivable a leader of a more &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; institution such as a political party could. This may be a particular property of some kings and queens more than others - after all support for Queen Elizabeth was substantially higher than the support for Britain remaining a monarchy at the same time -  but it almost by definition cannot be a property of anyone involved in a close-run battle for electoral success.</p>
<p>The US of course famously has no monarch, having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence">torn themselves away</a> from the British one in 1776, but to many external observers seems to be riven by a particularly polarised politics. Certain presidential candidates appear to attract high amounts of almost conditionless blind-seeming loyalty from their supporters, as sentimental and irrational as anything one might feel for a monarch.</p>
<p>Leslie also considers that the constitutional monarchy gives us a way to express positive sentiment for our fellow country-people. Not that we don&rsquo;t understand that they live an incredibly privileged and unusual live, and sometimes we may quite legitimately feel jealous or resentful of that. But at the end of the day we can acknowledge their common humanity. As a human family they proxy for all the country&rsquo;s families. The widespread doting over whoever the latest royal child is - who is after all just one of the hundreds of children born each day in the UK - being a reminder that we could and should feel love all those other children too.</p>

			 <p>I see the queue of people waiting their turn to see Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s coffin - now known across the internet as The Queue - now has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queue">its own Wikipedia page</a>. Although perhaps not for long; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Queue">the discussion</a> as to whether it should be deleted for not being notable enough for its own page is ongoing.</p>
<p>By reading the debate, I learned that by deliberately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/13/toilets-and-first-aid-on-five-mile-queue-route-to-view-queens-coffin">limiting its length to 5 miles</a> the queue controllers are preventing it from reaching the length of the queue for the grave of the current world record holder for the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/65207-largest-funerals">largest funeral gathering</a>. This was the funeral of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._N._Annadurai">Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai</a> in India, whose funeral was apparently attended by 15 million people, with a queue of 6 miles.</p>
<p>Earlier today the Queen Elizabeth queue maxed out its allocated length, with wait times expected to be at least 14 hours. The Queue <a href="https://twitter.com/DCMS/status/1570696999372214272">was thus temporarily closed</a> to new entrants. Cue<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2022/sep/16/queen-elizabeth-ii-lying-in-state-westminster-hall-king-charles-iii-mourners-queue-london-live-news-latest-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-632442fa8f0836766296d35a#block-632442fa8f0836766296d35a"> the queue for The Queue</a>.</p>
<p>For people that don&rsquo;t mind spoilers, a live stream of the destination of the queue <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-62902778">is available from the BBC</a>. Although I find the coverage a little creepy because the camera often focuses in on individual mourners rather than the coffin.</p>
<p>I hope that they have been made aware that their expression of sorrow is being transmitted to the world at large. For me, that would surely take something away from what I&rsquo;d expect to be a solemn, personal and perhaps emotional moment.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780307745439">How to Survive a Plague: The Story of How Activists and Scientists Tamed AIDS</a> by David France 📚.</p>
<p>A book about a global pandemic that appears to have been dramatically mismanaged at first with some appearances by Dr Fauci seems all too contemporary. But this one is actually about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS pandemic</a>, primarily in the US.</p>
<p>There was of course a staggering death count - an <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids">estimated 40 million lives</a> lost so far - with all the associated heart-breaking pain and misery, physical and mental, for those who caught the disease and those who loved them.</p>
<p>But of course what was particularly insidious in this case was that the large majority of those afflicted with the deadly infection at the start of the pandemic were gay men. And this was a population that the extraordinarily prejudiced mainstream opinion at the time was all too happy to disparage, disregard, ignore or blame.  The world just seem didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A large part of the book surrounds how in the end activist groups, often largely composed of people very ill with AIDS themselves, simply had to keep fighting for years - sometimes to the extent of basically infiltrating government or medical research organisations - until the government, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, media and indeed the rest of society couldn&rsquo;t ignore the devastation any more.</p>

			 <p>In case you haven&rsquo;t had enough <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rapidly-accelerating-measles-outbreak-kills-almost-700-children/">of</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">awful</a> <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022">viruses</a> yet in 2022, it seems that polio is back in the US, at least in New York.</p>
<p>Polio has no known cure. Whilst most infected people don&rsquo;t develop noticable symptoms, it <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/poliovirus-in-london-wastewater-is-it-a-cause-for-concern#Quick-facts-about-polio">can cause outcomes as harmful as paralysis</a> in some patients, a fraction of which may die due to paralysis of their breathing muscles. It was once <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/polio-20th-century-epidemic">known as infantile paralysis</a>, due to children&rsquo;s heightened vulnerability to the disease.</p>
<p>Only one human case had been detected as of four days ago, but it&rsquo;s been seen in the city&rsquo;s wastewater and become enough of an issue that the mayor <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62857112">declared a state of emergency</a>. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0913-polio.html">has confirmed</a> that the US should now be considered a country with circulating poliovirus again, after 43 years of polio-free status.</p>
<p>One driving factor is likely the fact that polio vaccination rates are really not very high in some places any more, as shown in <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/polio-vaccination-coverage-by-zip.pdf">this map</a> from the City of New York&rsquo;s website. Nearly half of Williamsburg&rsquo;s young children haven&rsquo;t been fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Over here in the UK we&rsquo;re hardly immune - polio has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/23/uk-polio-virus-london-sewage/">detected in our sewage</a> too, although we don&rsquo;t seem to have found any reported transmission within the community.

<p>The theory is that accessible mobile phones allowed the black market trade to be conducted and coordinated privately by phone. Customers could be met at discreet locations rather than trade needing to be plied directly on the street in fixed locations. This reduced street-level turf battles between gangs who funded their activities via drug sales in ways that frequently involved violence, as well as potentially &ldquo;democratising&rdquo; the market to allow other types of sellers in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/09/12/survey-shows-that.html">Survey shows that young British people increasingly support authoritarian rule</a></h1>

			 <p>Traditionally, we might have expected the UK&rsquo;s young people to be more liberal or left-wing than their older counterparts on most topics - see for example which party various age groups voted for in the 2019 general election <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/wl0r2q1sm4/Results_HowBritainVoted_2019_w.pdf">according to Yougov&rsquo;s poll</a>. But from a recent report it seems like younger folk are not huge fans of a rather fundamental aspect of liberal democracies - the democracy part.</p>
<p>A poll conducted by J.L. Partners on May 2022 for <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kids-arent-alright-democracy.pdf">a report</a> published by <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/">Onward</a>, a conservative thinktank, on a sample of UK respondents weighted to be nationally representative on several demographic factors found that young people are not great fans of democracy.</p>
<p>Starting off with a chart shown on page 20 of the report:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We see the younger age brackets having fairly low net support when asked whether a democracy was a a “very good”, “fairly good”, “fairly bad”, or “very bad” way of running the country. Around a quarter of 18-34 year olds felt that democracy is a bad way of governing the country (the equivalent figure for over-55s is 8%).</p>
<p>A similar net proportion of the young thought some kind of technocracy was a good way to run a country as felt the same about democracies.</p>
<p>Admittedly life in the UK doesn&rsquo;t exactly feel well-governed to many of us at present, to put it politely -  so perhaps that&rsquo;s fairly understandable. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/10/young-adults-loss-of-faith-in-uk-democracy-survey">different survey</a>, carried out by IPPR found that only 19% of UK&rsquo;s 18-24 year olds felt democracy has served them well, vs 55% who say badly. What surprised me a bit more was the support for some of the rather more authoritarian options.</p>
<p>There was a net 23% support for &ldquo;a strongman who can ignore parliament&rdquo; as a good way to run the country in 18-34 year olds, vs a negative -42% in &gt; 55 year olds.  60% of the youngest group, 18-24 year olds thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Even the rather radical &ldquo;put the army in charge&rdquo; only <em>just</em> got a negative support rating in younger cohorts - net disapproval of 8% in 18-34 year olds vs -74% in &gt;55 year olds.  44% of the 18-24 year olds were favourable towards  this type of rule.</p>
<p>So is this a young person thing? Maybe despite being liberal in many other domains young folk always think strongman or army rule is a decent option? As well as not really making intuitive sense, it also isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To be honest, I find the even the agreement level in the &ldquo;good years&rdquo; surprisingly high - and just look at the 2019 results! -  but clearly something changed such that the younger folks still think relying on a single strong leader is a good way forward.</p>
<p>Likewise a pro army rule position has just gotten more and more popular over time, especially in younger cohorts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Based on this admittedly fairly small time series, it doesn&rsquo;t look to be a general age effect.</p>
<p>Some of the factors the report suggests are linked to this support for authoritarian rule include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Socio-economic circumstances, with the least secure 20% of voters being more than twice as likely as the most secure to say that democracy is a bad way to govern the country.</li>
<li>Social connection, with people with more friends, or more diverse friend circles, being less likely to support authoritarian rule.</li>
<li>Political leanings, with socially conservative young people being much more likely than liberal folk to support the strong man or army rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of that makes intuitive sense at least on the dislike of democracy side of things. If you live in a democracy and you have a particularly difficult life, why would you feel like it&rsquo;s a good way to run things?</p>
<p>Thinking one form of rule is a good way to govern a country of course doesn&rsquo;t rule out also thinking others are. For example, young people who report generally trusting other people are both more likely to support democracy than those who don&rsquo;t, (81% vs 69%) but also more like to support strongman leaders (72% vs 51%). In fact a higher proportion of young people who say democracy is a good way to run the country also support the authoritarian methods of rule than those who don&rsquo;t. Perhaps some people just think that there <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a good way to run a country?</p>
<p>The report authors believe that the drivers of general detachment that are leading to this and many other negative effects on young people can be summarised as being the narrowness of their social networks, overprotective parenting, the treadmill of modern work and the online culture.</p>

			 <p>No UK resident can have missed the news that the cost of electricity to the consumer in the UK is going up and up, to truly unprecedented levels. The way it works over here is that the government issues a cap, which limits the maximum amount the energy supply companies can charge consumers. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll look in more detail as to how this is calculated in future but to be extremely simplistic about it at present, the majority of the increase is down to the wholesale cost of energy to the supplier, which is presently very high. In fact a bunch of them <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58732683">went bankrupt last year</a>.</p>
<p>A year ago the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/09/energy-bills-price-freeze-cost-of-living-government-liz-truss-/">cap worked out at £1,277</a> for the average UK consumer. Earlier this year it had already painfully zoomed up to £1,971. In October, had it been worked out in the standard way, it would be not-far-off-doubled to £3,549.</p>
<p>The Government has tried to mitigate some of the obvious impending disaster by putting a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-bills-support/energy-bills-support-factsheet-8-september-2022">price guarantee</a>&rdquo; on it such that the average consumer will be paying £2,500. So a lot less than £3,549 thankfully, but still substantially more than it ever has been.</p>
<p>One thing to understand about the energy cap is that it is not&hellip;a cap. Or at least not an overall one. You will always pay more if you use more electricity. The quoted cap is on the cost it would be for an average consumer. This translates down to a cap on the standing cost and unit price. If you have a big or energy inefficient house you may well pay substantially more than £2,500. So even if you manage to save up enough money to pay the £2,500, you still shouldn&rsquo;t go wild from a financial, let alone an environmental, point of view.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are apparently no tariffs that are appreciably below the maximum permitted cost to switch to, per <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/-are-there-any-cheap--fixed-energy-deals-currently-worth-it--/">Martin Lewis</a>. So most of the levers we can pull at an individual level are about cutting down on the usage of electricity. Not necessarily a bad thing for other reasons too, including environmental, if it can be done without impacting people&rsquo;s wellbeing. But that&rsquo;s a big and often unrealistic if.</p>
<p>Some people, myself included, are billed at a different cost in the day vs in the night, aka economy 7, in which case perhaps retiming your electricity consumption will help. Although it seems weirdly difficult to learn what counts as day or night unless your electric meter is labelled or you have a smart meter - it&rsquo;s not the same for everyone. In the end I just asked my electricity supplier. And will attempt to do my washing after 10pm from here on in!</p>
<h2 id="what-devices-should-we-focus-on-to-reduce-our-electricity-consumption-and-hence-costs">What devices should we focus on to reduce our electricity consumption and hence costs?</h2>
<p>The general rule seems to be that most modern electronics <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/1566694684289818625?s=20&amp;t=uEByLd9cUcNZehi390sNjg">don&rsquo;t cost a whole lot</a> - modern bulbs, LCD televisions, charging your phone etc. It&rsquo;s not <em>zero</em>, so there&rsquo;s a perhaps a little potential saving you can do there. But unfortunately the big deals tend to be appliances that relate to <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/1566694686974447618?s=20&amp;t=uEByLd9cUcNZehi390sNjg">heating or eating</a>, both of which are fairly essential.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-02/price-breakdown-how-much-will-it-cost-to-run-appliances-in-uk-energy-crisis">Bloomberg</a> had a nice chart which combined the energy consumption of the average device of a given type with the average usage time to show the cost. Now the actual costs shown on it  will be a bit higher than reality I believe because the £2500 price guarantee hadn&rsquo;t been announced when they published this - but still the &ldquo;big circles are the expensive ones&rdquo; idea holds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The washing machine cost I understand to be highly dependent on the temperature of the wash. If you can wash at a lower temperature you&rsquo;ll save electricity. I&rsquo;ve started trying 30 degrees for everything.</p>
<p>All heating-related ones are clearly the big drain. With regards to saving on central heating itself, I&rsquo;ve seen tips around the internet that concentrate on heating the people rather than the entire house if times are real tough. For instance you can see in the above that using electric blankets is way, way cheaper than central heating. I&rsquo;ve also seen suggestions for hot water bottles.</p>
<p>To get a more precise personal estimate, there are also energy cost calculators, like <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/">sust-it</a> where you can <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/energy-calculator.php">type in the energy consumption</a> of your appliance and the time you want to use it for to get a cost estimate. It also has guides for specific types of appliances e.g. <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/vacuum-cleaners.php">vacuum cleaners</a> or <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/microwave-ovens.php">microwaves</a>. It also allows you to compare models of appliances based on energy efficiency if you&rsquo;re in the market for something new.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-dry-my-clothes">How should I dry my clothes?</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://www.sust-it.net/energy-calculator.php">general calculator</a> to help me think about clothes drying on occasions we have too much laundry to hang around the house and the weather won&rsquo;t allow the washing line to do the trick. I used Martin Lewis' estimate of 34p per kWh, found <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/09/energy-bills-price-freeze-cost-of-living-government-liz-truss-/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our washing machine also has drying functionality. Whilst I can find that the appliance is overall energy rating B, I can&rsquo;t quickly figure out how to know what that means specifically for the dryer component in watts. I&rsquo;d say it usually takes 1-2 hours to complete.
The Bloomberg chart above suggested £1.95 per load. Trying to work backwards from <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/washer-dryers/article/energy-efficient-washer-dryers-aGNaQ0N58yv6">Which&rsquo;s figures for the cheapest washer dryer</a> I get to about £1.21 (and I&rsquo;m sure ours isn&rsquo;t the cheapest.) <a href="https://www.inspirecleanenergy.com/blog/sustainable-living/how-much-electricity-dryer">This page</a> suggests the average dryer is about 3000 kwH which for 1.5 hours would be £1.53. This site has says a tumble dryer cycle is 4.5 kWH, which would equate to the same.</p>
<p>We also have a dehumidifier that works reasonably well, but may need leaving on the entire day, let&rsquo;s say 8 hours. It has two settings, I usually use the clothes drying option which I assume is the high one, 725W. That&rsquo;s mean it&rsquo;d cost £1.97. Using the lower one would knock it down to £1.14.</p>
<p>There are also heated drying racks out there. In the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sun-selects/15821170/best-heated-clothes-airers/">Sun&rsquo;s rundown</a> of &ldquo;the best&rdquo; ones, the one they prefer overall  is 230W. It seems that there&rsquo;s great variance in how long clothes take to dry on them, but let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;d take between 5 and 10 hours. That&rsquo;d imply a cost of 39p - 78p.</p>
<p>So from that I guess there&rsquo;s not much benefit in using the dehumidifier for long periods over the tumble drying facility of the washing machine. The heated rack sounds a more economical option, except that I&rsquo;d have to buy it in the first place.</p>

<p>Seeing as in 2022 we continue to inhabit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror">Black Mirror</a> Timeline there is of course one other option. Exploitation via light entertainment! Here&rsquo;s a much shared clip of a phone-in TV contest gameshow where the top prize on offer was &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pay your electricity bills for 4 months&rdquo;, the concept of which was fairly <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/quickfire/2022/09/this-morning-spin-to-win-energy-bills-competition-black-mirror">condemned by many folk</a> out there as entirely dystopian.

			 <p>I <a href="https://braindump.amedcalf.com/2022/09/10/finished-reading-the.html">recently read</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250827630">The Expectation Effect</a>, a fascinating book looking at how what you expect influences what actually happens with regard to your body and life.</p>
<p>Below is a fairly detailed summary of chapter 6 (prioritised as being most potentially relevant to my work). I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be talking a lot more about the rest of this book in future. But for now, the main topic of this chapter was how your beliefs and expectations influence how your body and brain react to what you eat - potentially useful knowledge for anyone interested in healthy eating.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our brain&rsquo;s predictive processing means that our <em>expectation</em> of what nutrients a food contains directly affects how our body responds to that food, including our:</p>
<ul>
<li>digestion, i.e. the breaking down and absorption of nutrients in the gut.</li>
<li>metabolism, i.e. how we process the food to power our cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we believe we&rsquo;re eating fewer calories than we really are, our body responds to that belief. The brain induces a deprivation mindset, and we feel less satiated, more hungry and inclined to expend less energy in order to preserve fat stores.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that appetite is controlled in part by activity in the digestive system - bottom-up information. However the brain also seems to need top-down info e.g. memory and expectation, to make sense of the digestive information input in order to create the appropriate feelings of hunger or satiation.</p>
<p>Altering how we think about food can change the brain&rsquo;s assessment of what it has eaten.</p>
<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>A patient who had lost the ability to form new memories, was asked to rate how hungry he was on a scale of 0 -100. He rated his hunger similarly both before and after consuming a meal.  After two meals in a row he felt only partly satiated.</p>
<p>This suggests that our appetite is not solely governed by &ldquo;fullness signals&rdquo; from the stomach. It&rsquo;s also influenced by our memory of what we ate.</p>
<p>Milder forgetfulness is also associated with over-eating.</p>
<p>In an experiment asking students to taste test cookies, they consumed 45% less if they had first been prompted to remember their lunch by noting down what they&rsquo;d eaten.</p>
<p>Working, watching TV or using the internet whilst eating may create a distraction that impairs our memory of what we ate, leading to eating larger meals and more snacks afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="expectation">Expectation</h2>
<p>The sense of fullness and satisfaction participants had from eating either 300ml or 500ml of soup was largely based on how much soup they thought they&rsquo;d eaten, rather than how much they actually had.</p>
<p>Participants who believed they&rsquo;d eaten a 3 egg omelette felt more satiated than those who thought they&rsquo;d eaten a 1 egg omelette, even though they&rsquo;d eaten the same amount.</p>
<p>Patients who believed that they&rsquo;ve undergone obesity-related surgery, e.g. stomach stapling or gastric balloon, experienced 70% of the benefits of the operation (reduced appetite, higher weightloss) even though the actual surgery never took place.</p>
<h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>
<p>The presentation of manufactured foods can disrupt our brain&rsquo;s ability to assess its contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain remembers eating a lot less after drinking a small bottled smoothie vs eating the equivalent portions of fruit, giving the expectation of hunger later in the day.</li>
<li>Several studies show that the exact same food leads to lower satiety when it is labelled &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as opposed to when it&rsquo;s labelled &ldquo;hearty&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The more viscous a drink is the more filling we expect it to be, and the higher our physiological response.</li>
<li>Iron absorption from meals that have been pureed were much lower than the same meal presented in its standard form.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; snacks may be counterproductive - participants given a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; chocolate bar were hungrier afterwards than those given nothing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beliefs">Beliefs</h3>
<p>When presented with a choice of 2 items such as a McDonald&rsquo;s hamburger and a 8.5oz grilled ocean code, most people think the burger has more calories even though they&rsquo;re about equal, over or underestimating the true value by up to 50%. People who have greater mismatches in their estimates are on average heavier.</p>
<p>People who agree more strongly with statements such as &ldquo;There is usually a trade-off between healthiness and tastiness&rdquo; tend to have higher BMIs.</p>
<h2 id="mechanisms">Mechanisms</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin">Ghrelin</a> is a hormone secreted by the stomach when it&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p>High levels induce our body to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower its metabolic resting rate, burning less energy.</li>
<li>store body fat.</li>
<li>feel lethargic, so we don&rsquo;t waste energy on exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants who had drank a milkshake marketed as indulgent saw lower ghrelin levels, as expected after a meal. But those who drank the same milkshake presented as healthy and light, saw very little change in ghrelin.</p>
<p>Brain areas associated with energy regulation are also affected. People given a low-calorie drink labelled as a treat had a stronger hypothalamus response when it was labelled as a &ldquo;treat&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;,</p>
<p>Expectations also affect the movement of food in the gut and our insulin responses.</p>
<h2 id="the-environment">The environment</h2>
<p>Our environment reinforces the idea that healthy foods are less satisfying. An analysis of 26 American chain restaurants that offer &ldquo;healthy eating&rdquo; options saw that they were less likely to have descriptions relating to enjoyment, vice, decadence, texture and taste. They were more likely to be described in terms evoking simplicity, thinness, or deprivation.</p>
<p>In one study where these healthy options were described with words evoking enjoyment and indulgent, consumption of them increased 29% and were likely to lead to lower snacking afterwards. Adding the words &ldquo;fuller for longer&rdquo; to a yoghurt pot increased people&rsquo;s satiety for 3 hours.</p>
<p>Low socioeconomic status is a risk factor for obesity. There are many potential explanations. One study showed that when people are primed to feel poorer and less secure they tend to choose sweeter snacks and have bigger portion sizes, corresponding to observable changes in the body and brain. People&rsquo;s feelings of social and financial insecurity induced a sense of deprivation which influenced their hormonal response. For people living with this sense of vulnerability long-term, it&rsquo;s possible that this response could increase your likelihood of obesity even if your food choices were healthy.</p>
<h2 id="the-belief-that-healthy-foods-are-unsatisfying-isnt-universal">The belief that healthy foods are unsatisfying isn&rsquo;t universal.</h2>
<p>That belief is strongly held in the US and to a lesser extent the UK and Australia - but the opposite view is more common in France. It&rsquo;s been shown that labelling a food as healthy in France doesn&rsquo;t reduce the satisfaction and pleasure as much as elsewhere.</p>
<p>French people also have fewer negative sentiments associated with treats. When asked to describe which word is more associated with ice-cream, more US people pick &ldquo;fattening&rdquo; whereas French people more commonly pick &ldquo;delicious&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This attitude seems to affect their eating choice and body responses. French people tend to choose smaller servings and spend more time eating them.</p>
<p>The average BMI in France (25.3) is lower than other countries like Germany (26.3), Australia (27.2), the UK (27.3) and especially the US (28.8).</p>
<p>The typical French diet contains higher proportion of saturated fat from butter, cheese, eggs and cream than the UK/US equivalent, yet French people are less likely to suffer from coronary heart disease. There are many possible reasons but expectation could be one. People who believe that they are more at risk of a heart attack are 4x as likely to suffer from heart disease even controlling for other factors.</p>
<h2 id="eating-is-not-a-simple-chemical-process">Eating is not a simple chemical process.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;exactly the same item can be nourishing and satiating, or unfulfilling and nutritionally empty – in large part because of our memories of what we have eaten, our impressions of what it contains and the meanings that we ascribe to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="some-ways-to-apply-these-findings">Some ways to apply these findings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the liquid calories in sweetened drinks.
<ul>
<li>The satiety of most drinks is low</li>
<li>If you must drink juices and smoothies, make them yourself so you are more aware of the food that went into them - research suggests doing this may increase your satiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maximise the pleasure in the food you eat.  Flavour and texture are important during weight loss as the resulting sense of indulgence increases satiety and hormonal response to food. The lack of later snacking due to greater satiety will outweigh the small number of extra calories this my require.
<ul>
<li>Spicy foods or intensely umami ingredients are good options.</li>
<li>Avoid food that gives a sense of deprivation.</li>
<li>Thoroughly enjoy any treats - feeling guilt won&rsquo;t help.  One study showed that dieters who associated treats such as cake with guilt gained weight vs those who associated them with celebration progressed towards their goals.</li>
<li>Do not label foods as sinful, toxic etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualise and anticipate what you&rsquo;re going to eat in advance.
<ul>
<li>Participants who were asked to imagine the taste, smell and texture of sweet treats first opted to have a smaller slice of cake when one was offered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid distractions when eating.</li>
<li>Eat slowly, savoring each mouthful. The greater sensory experience of eating will trigger a stronger hormonal reaction to the food.</li>
<li>Remember what you have eaten.
<ul>
<li>If you feel tempted to snack then first recall what it was like to eat your last meal. Your brain may update its predictions of energy balance, making you feel less hungry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get to try a bit from all 3000+ bottles unfortunately. Some are pretty rare. The one in the middle below with the colourful artwork on the label apparently sells for around £80,000, if I remember correctly.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although I guess that&rsquo;s a bargain compared to a bottle that <a href="https://www.maxim.com/food-drink/most-expensive-whiskey-at-auction-2018-5/">sold for £1.1 million</a> in auction a few years ago I guess. I suppose billionaires needed something to do with their money before NFTs were a thing.</p>
<p>The oldest ones in the collection were these two, from the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whilst it looks like someone&rsquo;s drunk a fair bit of especially the right hand one, apparently that&rsquo;s not the case - these are technically unopened bottles. What&rsquo;s missing there is the &lsquo;<a href="https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/angels-share/">angel&rsquo;s share</a>&rsquo;, an ongoing amount of whiskey that evaporates into the atmosphere over time if not perfectly sealed.</p>
<p>I decided I&rsquo;m a big fan of whiskies from the Islay region.</p>

			 <p>For the past 3 months, Germany has been trialling a scheme where for €9 a month people can travel on any regional trains, subways, trams and buses nationwide. Compared to the UK cost of public transport that&rsquo;s basically free!</p>
<p>It sounds like <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2022/08/lessons-germany-experiment-near-free-rail-travel-9-euro-ticket">it wasn&rsquo;t the best planned scheme</a>, so there&rsquo;s a lot any future such schemes should consider to improve implementation.</p>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s a winner. More of this please!</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, the last train ticket I bought here in the UK, which was booked weeks in advance and required me to take specific trains, cost around £100 for a single return trip.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whilst on vacation in Calabria, we didn&rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to take a trip to the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzo,_Calabria">Pizzo</a>. It&rsquo;s a lovely seaside town, with a 15th century castle overlooking the ocean.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A ghostly looking wire sculpture also sits there, permanently enjoying the view.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Slightly away from the rolling waves, the old town seems to be almost the stereotype of European cafe culture, replete with narrow streets and a town square.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But what most sets Pizzo apart from other delightful towns, and probably the reason it particularly attracts us tourists, is its famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartufo">Tartufo de Pizzo</a>. Described in <a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tartufo-di-pizzo-calabria-ice-cream">various places</a>, including by our tour guide, as &ldquo;the greatest ice cream in the world&rdquo; it is pretty special, and the town has upwards of 20 <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gelateria">gelaterias</a> serving it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a ball of icecream, traditionally chocolate and hazelnut, although there were plenty of other variations on hand, dusted in chocolate powder. This surrounds a delicious melted chocolate centre. Each creator apparently has their own special and top secret recipe for how to make that delectable middle, and they&rsquo;re made in a way that&rsquo;s quite impossible to reproduce the splendour of in for instance a mass supermarket bought product.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The origin story is that a famous ice-cream seller - I&rsquo;ve seen different names given to him in different places so will treat him as anonymous here - needed to make a bunch of desserts for an important event full of VIPs. But, oh no, he ran out of moulds to shape them. Desperate not to let them down he just used his hands to create a rough sphere of ice-cream around some melted chocolate, and dusted them in sugar and chocolate. And thus the phenomena was born.</p>

			 <p>Another place we visited whilst in Calabria was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropea">Tropea</a>. Legendarily founded by Hercules, it&rsquo;s a seaside location which has previously won a &ldquo;most beautiful village in Italy&rdquo; <a href="https://www.calabriatheotheritaly.com/tropea-calabria-italy/">award</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of quaint narrow streets, with many shops selling either fashion items or the famed local <a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tropea-onions-red-queen-calabria">red Tropea onion</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We picked up a jar of &ldquo;onion marmalade&rdquo; which was far nicer than it sounds. The area is also famed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Nduja">&lsquo;nduja</a> spicy salami.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cathedral that&rsquo;s been there since the 12th century.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s dedicated to the Madonna of Romania, who supposedly protects the town. Presumably as evidence for that claim, there are a couple of World War II bombs that hit the town but for some reason never exploded displayed right inside the cathedral.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another point of interest is the 4th century <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santa-maria-dellisola-monastery">Sanctuary of Santa Maria dell’Isola Benedictine monastery</a>. It&rsquo;s been hit by earthquakes a couple of times since then so has had some rather more modern rebuilds, but nonetheless remains extremely picturesque.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The town is right on the seaside as the above picture suggests. Once again, the sea in this region had some truly incredible colours.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We made a quick visit to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capo_Vaticano">Capo Vaticano</a>. It&rsquo;s a beautiful spot on the Italian coast.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The colour of the sea in this region was pretty magical.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The tour guide made it clear that despite its name it was nothing to do with the Vatican. Rather, the area around it seems to be most famous for growing &ldquo;<a href="https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/features/tropea-onions-red-queen-calabria">Rosse di Tropea</a>&rdquo; - the red onions of Tropea.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/sweet-red-onion-tropea">Italy Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The onion’s extraordinary sweetness, its delicate scent, its lightness and enjoyable taste, which derive from the morphological peculiarities of the soil and microclimate where it is grown, make it a much sought after ingredient by gourmets and chefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not wrong! They are surprisingly delicious, just eaten raw. Not something I&rsquo;d usually expect of an onion. Recommended.</p>
<p>In Britain we&rsquo;d need to import the finished onion though. Apparently just growing some locally from seed won&rsquo;t do the job at all; it&rsquo;s all about the conditions of the local land.</p>
<p>But, whilst there were many nearby stalls selling the onion, the most obvious plant life at the place we stopped was what looked to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia">prickly pear cactuses</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think to sample the fruit, although it sounds like they&rsquo;re perfectly palatable <a href="https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=2157">if you&rsquo;re careful about removing all the spines</a>.

			 <p>For our first travels abroad since the start of the Covid pandemic, we recently decided to go holiday in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria">Calabria</a>, a southern region of Italy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We stayed at the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g669647-d15565271-Reviews-TUI_MAGIC_LIFE_Calabria-Pizzo_Province_of_Vibo_Valentia_Calabria.html">TUI Magic Life Calabria</a>&rdquo; hotel, which did indeed seem fairly magical!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the scene as one walks towards the lodges we stayed in:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although rather more of our time was spent by the pool.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&hellip;at least in between the <a href="https://www.thelocal.it/20220810/italy-issues-storm-alert-for-central-and-southern-regions-as-heatwave-breaks/">severe storms</a>, which had quite incredible amounts of thunder and lightning. But fortunately they mostly tended to happen at night so didn&rsquo;t impact the fun and games too much (with the possible exception of <a href="https://watchers.news/2022/08/13/violent-storm-hits-stromboli-covering-streets-and-homes-in-tons-of-mud/">a mudslide in Stromboli</a> meaning a trip we&rsquo;d planned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli">the volcano</a> got cancelled).</p>
<p>It was just a 15 minute walk to the beach, which with a mountainous backdrop was a real delight.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One could even rent a bed down there, if a standard sunlounger seemed too much like hard work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wandering to the beach takes one through a nice shady forest area.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With no shortage of places to comfortably lie down and take in the woody vibes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There was no shortage of entertainment on offer, more than a lazy vacationer like me could ever get to.</p>
<p>The forest concealed an archery range I took a couple of sessions on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As well as managing to get thoroughly beaten at giant chess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I never made it to the tennis lessons, and of course deliberately avoided any activity labelled &ldquo;expert&rdquo; or &ldquo;high intensity&rdquo;. I did just about manage the gym there a couple of times, which is a world record.</p>
<p>On the more spectatory front, there was frequent live music offerings in the little town square type setup they had.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One night a week was &ldquo;Italian night&rdquo; where some supposedly more traditional entertainment was at hand.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Alongside some larger scale antics in a stadium setup. This included a re-enactment of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA">Thriller video</a>:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some death-defying acrobatics:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And many more varieties of singing and dancing, top of the costuming list perhaps being these folk:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once a week there was a beach party.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even the food was usually pretty great (and unlimited enough to register a decent increase on the scales the week I got back 😂).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Truly a wonderful experience, recommended to all. I&rsquo;d kind of forgotten how good vacations actually were, what with the pandemic and all.</p>

			 <p>I recently learned of the existence of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain%27s_Jawbone">Cain&rsquo;s Jawbone</a> book 📚. It&rsquo;s a murder mystery novel written in 1934.</p>
<p>However, the 100 pages of the book come to you arranged in the wrong order. To solve it you have to figure out the order they should be in. The number of possible combinations is a number with 158 digits.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Originally one could win a prize for doing so - £15 in 1934, and £1000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/10/literary-puzzle-solved-for-just-third-time-in-almost-100-years-cains-jawbone">more recently</a> after it was <a href="https://unbound.com/books/cains-jawbone-paperback/">re-released</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s only known to have been solved 4 times ever so far, the solution being almost the only thing not yet available for download on the internet.</p>

			 <p>Needed to remind myself today that <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/96/">there is no neat practical interpretation</a> of the Pearson&rsquo;s coefficient of correlation &ldquo;r&rdquo; after seeing a report that suggested otherwise.  It&rsquo;s true - it is useful for comparing how strong and in which direction correlations are between two variables. But that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>Or</p>

<p>The correlation coefficient is sometimes criticized as having no obvious intrinsic interpretation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as <a href="https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/fulltext/2018/05000/correlation_coefficients__appropriate_use_and.50.aspx">Schober et al</a> put it a little more formally.</p>
<p>You can square it to produce an R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you like to produce a &ldquo;coefficient of determination&rdquo;, which does have an IRL meaning. R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> expresses the percent of variation in one variable that&rsquo;s explained by the variation in the other one.</p>
<p>Just the same as R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in a linear regression model.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recorded crime in the UK has reached a 20 year high in the first quarter of 2022, with 6.3 million crimes recorded.</p>
<p>Now this may well relate to changes in policy or willingness to report rather than a general increase in crime. Especially as the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2022">ONS crime survey</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t require the crime to have been reported to the police, doesn&rsquo;t appear to show an increase in overall crime, at least at first glance.</p>
<p>But something that definitely appears to be the case is that only a tiny proportion of recorded crime results in someone being charged.</p>
<p>Now I usually find myself on the side of wanting to reduce the number of situations police get involved in. Criminalising someone should be a last resort. Police officers seem to be regularly sent in to handle situations that other people would likely be better trained for, including being asked to deal with an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/18/police-999-callouts-to-people-suffering-mental-health-crises-soars"> increasing number of situations</a> where someone is suffering from a mental health crisis. This is not a good situation for either party concerned.</p>
<p>But where a crime has been committed then that is the domain of the police. Despite not having a particularly optimistic view of the situation, even I was a little shocked to read that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/recorded-in-england-and-wales-at-20-year-high-as-charge-rate-hits-new-low">only 5.6% of offences</a> reported in 2021-2022 led to a suspect being charged or summonsed.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, rape remains one of the rarest crimes to end up with a suspect being charged, with only 1.3% of reported crimes resulting in one.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/07/police-fail-solve-single-theft-eight-10-neighbourhoods">Telegraph investigation</a> showed that in 84% of nearly 21,000 neighbourhoods that had reported at least one theft in the last three years, no suspects were ever identified fpr any of them. In 20 neighbourhoods over 100 thefts had been reported, with zero being solved.</p>
<p>No doubt part of this is explainable by the decline of the capabilities of many public services, at least partly thanks to Conservative&rsquo;s lack of investment or care.</p>
<p>The number of police officers in England and Wales<a href="https://fullfact.org/crime/police-numbers/"> fell by over 20,000</a> between 2010 and 2019, although <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955182/police-workforce-mar20-hosb2020.pdf">this looks</a> as though they increased to narrow the gap a little in 2020. I don&rsquo;t know the research on to what extent raw police numbers relate to the rate of solving crime, but intuitively presumably there&rsquo;s a floor at which there&rsquo;s simply no resources left to carry out thorough investigations. Even holding the numbers steady wouldn&rsquo;t make sense if there&rsquo;s an increase in the number of crimes being reported.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably also indirect effects based on cuts to other services.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nhs-crisis-armed-police-heart-attacks-b2138086.html">the Independent reported</a>  that due to a lack of NHS resources the police have now become a surrogate ambulance service in some places. Police personnel and vehicles are being sent to assist, transport and wait with patients who are suffering emergency medical conditions such as heart attacks. More sitting in hospitals waiting for a spare NHS bed for the unlucky patient they&rsquo;re with presumably entails less time to solve crimes.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781907661631">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a> by Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy 📚.</p>
<p>A fairly short, often harrowing, story about a man forced to confront his own death, and the actions of those around him. Lots to think about here about the nightmarish oft-unspoken issues we have dealing with death, whether our own or others. Very recommended, if you&rsquo;re ready to stare into the uncomfortable void.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/28/tolstoy-death-ivan-ilyich-devil-review">Guardian review</a> sums it up nicely as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a hard, pitiless stare into the abyss, not just of death, but of human nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of nuances one could (and I did 🙂 ) wade through, but TLDR is basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are just way more people that are vaccinated than unvaccinated in the UK. <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations">Over 93%</a> of the English eligible population have had at least 1 dose.</li>
<li>Those who are vaccinated tend to be older (and possibly have other high-risk conditions), making them much more vulnerable to dying from Covid if there is a brekathrough infection, which inevitably at times there is.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as you control for just the difference in number of and age of people it becomes apparent that the vaccines still seem very effective at saving lives.</p>

<p>&hellip;stuff about what it feels like to live. Instead of being a relief from what it feels like to live.</p>

<p>and I think he certainly achieved that goal in this book. I found this an incredible collection of short stories that range from the absurd through to those that have an upsettingly familiar verbalisation of the unspoken pain of everyday existence.</p>
<p>Pretty much every story felt enriching and deep, with a weirdly enticing property of &ldquo;are there more layers I&rsquo;m not even beginning to understand?&rdquo; upon completion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incarnations of Burned Children&rdquo; is both one of the shortest and one of the most intense and horrific stories I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>

			 <p>As a reminder of the increasing salience of climate change, it was interesting to read about the cohort of Americans who are <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/04/climateproof-duluth-why-the-city-is-attracting-climate-migrants">already making the decision on where to live</a> within their country based on perceived resilience to the effects of climate change. They&rsquo;re essentially internal climate migrants.</p>
<p>This sometimes involves moving from the &ldquo;prestigious&rdquo; popular cities, such as San Francisco with its proximity to regular wildfires, to lesser known places. It seems like the town of Duluth is <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-pioneers-flee-fire-heat-for-famously-frigid-duluth/">one semi popular option</a>. Although naturally that led to housing prices increasing rapidly. So, whilst one needed a certain amount of privilege to be in a position to relocate in the first place, it&rsquo;s increasingly going to be an opportunity only available to the wealthier; a continuation of the housing market&rsquo;s seemingly insatiable ability to divide the world into the haves and have-nots.</p>
<p>From the article, it doesn&rsquo;t seem that we know how many relocation decisions are <em>primarily</em> driven by climate concerns, but a <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/climate-change-migration-survey/">survey it links to</a> (I haven&rsquo;t checked validity of it!)  suggests it is something that many people at least consider as a factor, especially those under 45 years old.</p>
<p>For those people who do want to think about this, CNN used some analysis from a firm called FourTwentySeven that analyses climate risk data <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/opinions/climate-migration-in-america-california-duluth-sutter/index.html">to produce maps</a>  that show various measures of climate-related risk factors projected forward a decade or two.</p>

			 <p>In an unexpected twist, the latest front in the mostly-meh-version of the culture war that UK Conservatives seem desperate to provoke appears to be…the weather.</p>
<p>Sir John Hayes, a Conservative MP who  chairs the presumably sarcastically named  named ‘<a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956845/what-is-the-conservatives-common-sense-group">Common Sense Group</a>’ and by amazing coincidence also happens to <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/220711/hayes_john.htm">receive £50,000 a year</a> from an oil company, had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/07/17/tory-mp-calls-people-sheltering-from-extreme-heat-cowards-and-snowflakes-17013249/">the following</a> to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not a brave new world but a cowardly new world where we live in a country where we are frightened of the heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not surprising that in snowflake Britain, the snowflakes are melting.Thankfully, most of us are not snowflakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that we clamour for hot weather for most of the year and then shut down when it does heat up is indicative of the state in which we now live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone was curious about actual facts, the chance of the next few days featuring the hottest ever temperatures seen in the UK has risen to 80%, which is likely to <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/matt-frei/excess-deaths-heatwave-uk-weather-national-emergency-temperatures-40c/">cause thousands of deaths</a> even if people do ‘cowardly’ take precautions.</p>
<p>There’s a type of modern conservative - thankfully seen more overseas as far as I can tell - that really just seems to <em>love</em> owning libs by recommending that their own followers do things that are likely to cause harm to themselves.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday a friend sent me this absolute horror show of a temperature forecast map for the UK.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s already been hot a while, but seemingly next Monday and Tuesday are going to feel <em>extra</em> unlivable for us in the UK, where it&rsquo;s not very common for people to have air con or many other anti-being-too-hot facilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/12/uk-weather-amber-warning-for-extreme-heat-extended-into-next-week">MET has issued</a> an extreme heat warning. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/14/uk-heatwave-nhs-braced-as-minister-says-temperatures-could-hit-40c">NHS is trying to brace itself</a> for yet more health emergencies in amongst all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/10/theres-a-feeling-of-powerlessness-uk-healthcare-workers-on-rising-covid-numbers">ongoing Covid</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of heat can in particular be dangerous to older people with certain medical conditions, so there&rsquo;s lots of good advice out there about checking on your potentially vulnerable neighbours. But if it gets hot enough that a <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2022-07-12/what-is-a-level-4-heat-health-warning-and-could-there-be-a-national-emergency">level 4 heatwave alert</a> is issued for the first time ever, then then even the risk-factor-free population may suffer harm if precautions are not taken.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some of the potential side-effects of this type of excessive heat can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road surfaces and pavements melting, as <a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/roads-melt-and-rail-tracks-buckle-as-uk-heatwave-strikes-27-06-2018/">happened in previous heatwaves</a>.</li>
<li>Railway lines buckling. Railway lines can get to be <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/buckled-rail-and-summer-heat/">20 degrees hotter</a> than the air temperature. At a certain temperature, <a href="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/delays-explained/speed-restrictions/">restrictions</a> are placed on the speed of trains.</li>
<li>Electricity supply problems - both because there&rsquo;s an increase in demand for energy, and the heat reduces how much power the system can carry. Plus power stations get less efficient. It&rsquo;s possible that certain designs of nuclear power reactors <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/articles/nuclear-power-feeling-the-heat/">have to shut down</a> because the water used to cool them gets too warm, although so far that&rsquo;s never happened in the UK.</li>
<li>Water shortages, due to excessive demand.</li>
<li>Wildfires starting.</li>
<li>Smell, dust, infestations.</li>
<li>Reduced crop harvests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically a lot of stuff that in extremis sounds a little dystopian. But it is 2022, so I wouldn&rsquo;t rule any of it out.</p>
<p>There’s an estimated 30% chance that next week will in fact beat the current UK highest ever temperature on record, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/29/met-office-confirms-new-uk-record-temperature-of-387c">38.7 degrees Celsius</a> in July 2019.</p>
<p>New temperature records - and the associated death and destruction - might not be rare in the future though if we don&rsquo;t finally find a way to reduce humanity&rsquo;s damage to the environment. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16834-0#Sec10">study from a couple of years back</a> estimated that temperatures about 40 degrees would be seen every 3-4 years in the UK by the end of the century if we don&rsquo;t do something to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

			 <p>The Conservative leadership contest is progressing with all the charm and grace you would imagine. Intra-party leaks and briefings about rival candidates, lots of truly ludicrous tax cut promises and a bit of culture war here and there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many of them - eleven candidates at one point before Chishti, Javid and Shapps withdrew. And despite the fact that everyone has an opinion, it&rsquo;s not clear that we actually know who they even are.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547234440497209344">A poll</a> from <a href="https://comresglobal.com/">Savanta ComRes</a>  asked people to name the candidates based on their official photo.</p>
<p>Looking at the more realistic-to-have-a-chance few, about two-thirds of people could identify Rishi Sunak, a third could identify Liz Truss and just 11% managed Penny Mordaunt.</p>
<p>If you look only at Conservative voters, the numbers don&rsquo;t exactly sky-rocket - 77%, 45% and 16% respectively.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHopkins92/status/1547240171216769025">Two people</a> thought Mordaunt was the global soul-pop sensation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele">Adele</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a way this doesn&rsquo;t yet matter. The British public has no direct way to select the next Prime Minister. The way the system works it&rsquo;s only the <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/parties/Commons">358 Conservative MPs</a> that get a say in which candidate progresses at this stage. When it&rsquo;s down to the final two then a tiny subsection of the British public - the <a href="https://qz.com/1644202/who-are-the-160000-conservatives-picking-the-next-uk-prime-minister/">0.35% of the electorate</a> that are members of the Conservative party - get to cast their votes, assuming neither of the candidates stands down. So actually there&rsquo;s a way in which if 99% of Britons have no knowledge whatsoever of who any of the candidates are it might not change too much in terms of the short term outcome.</p>
<p>Of course the 0.35% who do get a vote are not a random selection of the population - they skew:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older: 40% are over 66 years old according to the <a href="https://esrcpartymembersproject.org/">Party Member&rsquo;s Project</a>, quoted by <a href="https://qz.com/1644202/who-are-the-160000-conservatives-picking-the-next-uk-prime-minister/">Quartz</a></li>
<li>Whiter: 97%  white vs 86% of the population</li>
<li>More &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; 86% from the top social classes &ldquo;ABC1&rdquo;, vs 55% of the population (at least the latter was the figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRS_social_grade">in 2016</a>)</li>
<li>Richer: 1 in 20 of them making more than £100k a year</li>
<li>Male: 70% male, vs an unsurprisingly near 50:50 split in the population</li>
</ul>
<p>Better yet, Ipsos Mori conducted <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/almost-4-10-think-rishi-sunak-would-do-good-job-pm-he-also-most-well-known-candidates">a survey</a> designed to be representative of adults aged 18-75 in Great Britain. One of the questions, appearing on slide 3 of <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-07/Ipsos_Conservative_Leadership_poll_130722_PUBLIC%20%28002%29.pdf">the output</a>, asked about &ldquo;familiarity with politicians&rdquo;, with most of the questions being about the Conservative leadership candidates.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sunak outpaces the others by quite a lot in terms of recognition. The politician least familiar to the British public in that survey was Stewart Lewis. A full 65% of people said they hadn&rsquo;t ever heard of him, and only 12% claimed to know at least a fair amount about him.</p>
<p>The inevitable twist is that there is no British politician called Stewart Lewis, despite the fact that over a third of people made out that they&rsquo;d heard of him - substantially higher than the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman constant</a> of 4%.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/07/04/royal-mail-are.html">Barcoding the Queen&#39;s head - the new(ish) British stamp</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/07/04/royal-mail-are.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-07-04 17:10:12 &#43;0100">Jul 4, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/">Royal Mail</a> released a bunch of <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcoded-stamps">stamps</a>, wherein the queen&rsquo;s face is accompanied by a weird looking barcode. When you scan the barcode in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-mail/id1435168829/">their app</a> you, somewhat inexplicably, get shown <a href="https://www.royalmail.com/sending/barcode-stamps/videos">a video of Shaun the Sheep</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(For reference, the perforation between the Queen&rsquo;s head and the barcode is fake, so you can&rsquo;t easily tear them off.)</p>
<p>This will invalidate the majority of stamps you might already own - the standard stamps that are just the Queen&rsquo;s head won&rsquo;t be valid after January 2023, although you can apply to swap the current ones for new ones if you like. But the special edition stamps with nice pictures on will still be OK to use.</p>
<p>Whilst badgering you to download an app to repeatedly watch a short novelty video is clearly massive added value worthy of this radical change alone, apparently that&rsquo;s not the entire goal behind this change. Rather <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset">Royal Mail claims</a> that the ability to track letters with barcodes will let it monitor and respond to changes in demand. It&rsquo;ll also apparently prevent people washing off the postmark ink from stamps and re-selling them for a second use on the black market. I guess that means that barcodes will be tracked and the stamps rejected if used more than once.</p>
<p>I had no idea that re-using stamps was an avenue of fraudulence so prevalent that it costs Royal Mail tens of millions of pounds a year, but apparently so. Re-using stamps <a href="https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14308/~/what-is-stamp-fraud">is already a crime</a>, for which you can be criminally prosecuted. On the receiver&rsquo;s end, they don&rsquo;t get the letter delivered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/royal-mail-crackdown-crooks-cash-12246684">unless they&rsquo;re willing to pay £1.50 and collect it</a>. Of course that&rsquo;s only if the crime is detected, but even pre-barcode Royal Mail made efforts in that direction, including apparently <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html">checking whether the stamp has lost its phosphor</a>.</p>
<p>There are seemingly some big operations out there. In 2019 Paul and Samantha Harrison <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7806207/Couple-washed-700-000-used-stamps-sold-Amazon-eBay-225-000-fraud.html">were convicted of fraud</a> for having washed the postmark ink off 700,000 used stamps and selling the resulting &ldquo;usable&rdquo; stamps online, meaning Royal Mail lost out on a potential £421,000 of revenue.</p>
<p>All that aside, stamp traditionalists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/eventually-it-will-just-be-a-barcode-wont-it-why-britains-new-stamps-are-causing-outrage-and-upset">not pleased</a> with the new design. I must admit feeling some aesthetic sympathy for their point of view.  And also some solidarity with the <a href="https://thehandwrittenletterappreciationsociety.org/">Handwritten Letter Appreciation Society</a>, which has below zero interest in digitally engaging with Shaun the Sheep when corresponding with fellow humans. Their founder, Dinah Johnson, worries that it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end for stamps in general, fearing that in future we&rsquo;ll just be sticking the boring barcode bit of the setup on envelopes.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/07/03/the-uks-carbon.html">The UK&#39;s carbon emissions trading scheme actually paid polluters last year</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://thebraindumpblog.com/2022/07/03/the-uks-carbon.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-07-03 16:18:40 &#43;0100">Jul 3, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The UK has an carbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Emissions_Trading_Scheme">emissions trading scheme</a> (ETS) such that, within certain industries, companies that create <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-costs/environmental/">environmentally damaging</a> carbon dioxide when doing whatever it is that they do have to own a permit for per ton of carbon dioxide that they emit. It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_emission_trading">cap and trade</a> type scheme, designed to limit CO2 emissions to a known maximum, and ensure emission allowances end up in the hands of those who most value them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of permits available, which can be traded on a free market. If you want to increase the amount of CO2 you want to emit, then you have to find someone willing to sell you their permit and pay whatever price they want for it. Thus, the polluter pays.</p>
<p>If, due to the laws of supply and demand, it starts to cost too much to buy such a permit on the market then you&rsquo;ll just have to figure out a way to not generate so much CO2 in the course of your business. Or pay a hefty fine if you do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion to be had about this type of policy from many viewpoints. But there&rsquo;s an obvious way to entirely invalidate any good effect it has, which would be to ensure that all companies have more than enough permits to do exactly what they want at no cost at all. So, naturally, that&rsquo;s exactly what the government seems to have done in recent times, at least for the UK aviation industry.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/secret-subsidies-how-the-gov-is-gifting-free-money-to-airlines/">Transport &amp; Environment analysis</a>, airlines were given free allowances worth £242 million last year, which corresponds to 4.4 million permits.</p>
<p>However only 3.4 million permits were actually used, meaning that not only did these companies not actually have to pay for their pollution, but in fact they could actually sell the excess 0.9 million permits on the market and make free money, if they could find a buyer. Had these been sold then that&rsquo;s apparently a potential of up to £72 million profit they&rsquo;d get for nothing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/24/uk-gave-airlines-44m-free-pollution-permits-in-2021-study-finds?CMP=share_btn_tw">Easyjet say they did not sell their excess</a>; others unknown.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re talking here about the government giving out these free allowances, of course this is all forgone public money (or &ldquo;taxpayer&rsquo;s money&rdquo;, if you believe in that concept).</p>
<p>One arguably &ldquo;mitigating&rdquo; reason this arose was because there were many fewer flights taken in 2021 than in previous years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It seems like airlines' <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-ets-apply-for-free-allocation">free allowances are based on data from 2010</a>. But a cap and trade scheme wherein each year the controlling body blindly adds more and more free permits to the market, even to the point that there&rsquo;s too many to even use, doesn&rsquo;t feel like a particularly efffective cap.</p>
<p>These permits are in any case <a href="https://www.fccaviation.com/regulation/united-kingdom/uk-emissions-trading-system">only required for UK flights departing to other UK destinations, the European Economic Area or Gibraltar</a>. So no permits are required for long haul flights, which are those that actually cause the most pollution from many airlines that operate in the UK. In 2019, only 14% of the CO2 emissions from British Airways required these permits.</p>

			 <p>Continuing my mostly subconscious attraction to media that has a &ldquo;is anything real?&rdquo; vibe -  maybe because the common definition of reality often feels like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">ARG</a> at present -  I watched 1997&rsquo;s <a href="https://trakt.tv/movies/the-game-1997">The Game</a> 📽.</p>
<p>Hard to think of much to say that isn&rsquo;t a spoiler, other than that, contrary to many commenters, I didn&rsquo;t mind the ending.  Sure it wasn&rsquo;t very plausible, but nor are a lot of things that <em>do</em> actually happen.</p>

			 <p>Finally got around to trying out <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/">Fall Guys</a> 🎮. It&rsquo;s a multiplayer battle royale type game where, as a contestant on a supposed TV show you&rsquo;ve got to get through various mini-games - mainly winning races and not falling into slime - until there&rsquo;s only 1 player left standing.</p>
<p>The premise, and something about the screen you get when each game concludes, gives me strong vibes of one of the TV shows that most stuck in my brain in the recent past, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game">Squid Game</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing dark about Fall Guys, it&rsquo;s all family-friendly fun. It&rsquo;s only Squid Game if everyone involved was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blobby">Mr Blobby</a>, you lived in a cartoon world, and when you lost you got fewer &ldquo;rewards&rdquo; than you otherwise would have, rather than being shot.</p>
<p>A better comparison might be the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi's_Castle">Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle</a>. In fact, one of the minigames is exactly the same as the second entry in this random collection of &ldquo;best bits&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mindless fun that I doubt isn&rsquo;t going to keep my attention in solitary form, but perhaps a good party game. It does feel a little microtransactiony-tacky, but they seem pretty cosmetic, and at least it means that the game is free to play.</p>

<p>Each year since 2014, there&rsquo;s been a <a href="https://www.futurelibrary.no/">Future Library</a> ceremony in a young Norwegian forest, wherein people witness an author handing over an unpublished manuscript.</p>
<p>That manuscript is locked away in a special &ldquo;Silent Room&rdquo; within Oslo library. All we know about it is its author and its title.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all most of us will probably ever know about it. Because it&rsquo;s not until the year 2124 that the manuscripts will be revealed, with the forest being chopped down in order to make the paper for the resulting books to be published on.</p>
<p>Naturally the authors involved, and most of the rest of the world, so far will likely be dead. So you&rsquo;re going to have to go through life just knowing you&rsquo;ll probably never be able to read the full works of Margaret Atwood,  David Mitchell, Sjón,  Elif Shafak, Han Kan, Karl Ove Knausgård,  Ocean Vuong, Tsitsi Dangarembga and whoever gets picked in the years to come.

			 <p>Flickers of joy amongst the desolation of 2022 can be felt through a good amount of the UK as the Conservatives were thoroughly beaten in last week&rsquo;s 2 by-elections.</p>
<p>The first was in Tiverton and Honiton, where the Tory incumbent had to quit on the basis of having been caught <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/disgraced-tory-mp-neil-parish-broke-law-by-watching-porn-in-commons">watching porn in the House of Commons</a> . Word on the street was that he was innocently <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/porn-mp-neil-parish-may-have-been-looking-for-a-claas-dominator-tractor-allies-suggest-1605703">searching for a &ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;-branded farm vehicle</a> but got led astray, twice.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/24/lib-dems-win-tiverton-and-honiton-byelection-overturning-huge-tory-majority">Lib Dems made out there</a>, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 24,000 - rumoured to be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/24/tories-lose-byelections-wakefield-tiverton-honiton-labour-lib-dems">biggest majority ever</a> to be overturned in a by-election, with an unprecedented 30 point swing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even their classic post victory stunt was only about 90% cringe this time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second was in Wakefield. The Tory incumbent there had to go, this time on the extremely upsetting basis that he had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/imran-ahmad-khan-sentenced-to-18-months-over-sexual-assault-of-boy-15">sent to jail for sexually assaulting a 15 year old boy</a>.</p>
<p>Here <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-61896693">it was Labour who got the seat</a>, this time with a margin of 4,921 votes, around a 13% swing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s not a naturally Conservative seat, the 2019 outcome  having been the first time they held it within nearly 90 years. But still, hopefully a sign that the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wall_(British_politics)">Red Wall</a>&rdquo; is vulnerable. At least if you&rsquo;re a party who just can&rsquo;t get rid of a leader that most of the population think is doing a real bad job at playing Prime Minister according to the <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating">latest YouGov polling</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When asked whether he would be resigning given this catastrophic result, Boris Johnson seemed to be continuing the trend of not letting real life get in the way of his hopes and dreams, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-delusional-third-term-27329859">started talking about his third term</a>.</p>
<p>That implies he&rsquo;s confident he&rsquo;ll still be &ldquo;leading&rdquo; our country in the 2030s; a thought described as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/25/boris-johnsons-aspiration-to-serve-for-a-third-term-delusional">completely delusional</a>&rdquo; by one of his previous cabinet ministers.</p>

			 <p>In one of those policies that might almost seem hilarious if it wasn&rsquo;t entirely based on ignorance, prejudice and cruelty, the Saudi Arabia state has apparently <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/19/middleeast/saudi-arabia-rainbow-colored-toys-ban-intl/index.html">sent out officials to confiscate any rainbow-coloured toys and clothing</a> on sale, be they colourful hair clips, hats, pencil cases or anything else bright and shiny.</p>
<p>Presumably because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_flag">Pride flags</a> usually have a rainbow-inspired  design, their rationale is that rainbow coloured products contradict &ldquo;normal common sense&rdquo;, send a &ldquo;poisoned message&rdquo; to children, and &ldquo;promote homosexual colours&rdquo;, whatever that could possibly even mean.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re concerned that if a child sees a rainbow coloured pencil case they will become gay. And that that&rsquo;s somehow a bad thing even if it wasn&rsquo;t pure nonsense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of their state position on what should be done should an <em>actual</em> rainbow appear in the sky.</p>

			 <p>What can one say, even as a citizen of another country, other than to share the anger and sorrow that in the past few days <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">the Supreme Court of the United States</a> looks to have destroyed decades of progress towards a better, more humane, society.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, the <a href="https://theconversation.com/3-ways-a-6-3-supreme-court-would-be-different-146558">6:3 conservative</a>, and seemingly very <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/judicial-activism">activist</a>, court started off by ruling that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jun/21/sonia-sotomayor-supreme-court-separation-church-state">a state cannot exclude religious schools from tuition programs</a>. The fact that states must - not can, but <em>must</em> - now subsidise religious organisations is particularly controversial for a country that makes a big deal of the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>Or as Justice Sotomayor <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/separation-of-church-and-state-is-crumbling-before-our-eyes">put it</a> in her dissent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feared that the Court was leading us to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment… Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then on Thursday, following 2 very high profile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york-joe-biden">mass</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-gun-violence">shootings</a> in the past few weeks (and another 283 mostly less profile such events <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">catalogued</a> so far this year), <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/23/supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-gun-law-along-ideological-lines-00041691">the court ruled</a> that New York&rsquo;s 100+ year old law that you should have a license and a specific reason if you want to carry a gun in a public space is illegitimate. Thus New Yorkers, and potentially in the future residents in another seven states with similar laws, will likely have to go about their business in the knowledge that anyone in their vicinity may have a concealed and loaded gun and, well, that&rsquo;s just how it is.</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/supreme-court-abortion-law-leak-roe-v-wade">the leak</a> became policy. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn?t=1656185382130">Roe vs Wade has been overturned</a>, against <a href="https://www.prri.org/spotlight/overturning-roe-would-fly-in-the-face-of-american-public-opinion/">the wishes of most Americans</a>  - even most religious Americans.</p>
<p>And with that so too the constitutional right for US citizens to have access to abortion. As we knew, nearly a quarter of states had &ldquo;trigger laws&rdquo; already in place with the purpose of banning safe and legal abortion in the case that this decision was made. And at least another quarter are thought likely to ban abortion, such that anyone who may become pregnant in around half of the US states just lost their right to self-determination, potentially their quality of their life, or, in the most awful cases, their life itself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the past few decades, countries have tended to move towards democracy, equal rights for women, and with that most often increasing access to abortion. The US appears to be moving in the opposite direction, a more authoritarian regime where even the elected president <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-court-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/">doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to do much</a> to restrain the impact of the views of five people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">These five, as well as the four others</a> that make up the entirety of the Supreme Court were appointed in a process not designed to be congruent with the will of the American people, which in recent times appears to have been enacted with  no shortage of controversy, even on its own terms.  As an external observer, they appear to me as a unremovable, unaccountable handful of appointees with sometimes life-or-death power over more than 300 million people&rsquo;s lived experiences.</p>
<p>The judges didn&rsquo;t temper the wording since the leaked draft one bit. Justice Thomas' concordance <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3535841-thomas-calls-for-overturning-precedents-on-contraceptives-lgbtq-rights/">explicitly called out</a> by name three cases that he thinks should be reconsidered - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut">Griswold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas">Lawrence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">Obergefell</a>.</p>
<p>These cases correspond to rulings that couples have the right to access contraceptives, that gay sex cannot be outlawed by states and the right to same-sex marriage. Within the US, the very idea that these already-decided issues would be back on any respectable court&rsquo;s agenda in 2022 is surely jarring, shocking, and likely deadly.</p>

			 <p>Herald the entry of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61840077">a new statistical misadventure</a> from our government, never shy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/boris-johnson-again-reprimanded-after-misleading-employment-claim">of</a> <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18490303.stats-watchdog-slams-uk-government-misleading-coronavirus-figures/">fiddling</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41301049">the</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/08/uk-statistics-body-has-serious-concerns-over-dfe-funding-claims">books</a>.</p>
<p>In the context of disparaging the current <a href="https://www.rmt.org.uk/">RMT union&rsquo;s</a> railway workers strike that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/rail-strikes-city-centres-quieter-as-people-heed-advice-to-avoid-travel">taking place at the moment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr Shapps went on to say: &ldquo;The median salary for the rail sector is £44,000, which is significantly above the median salary in the country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We asked the Department for Transport (DfT) how it got to this figure and it initially said it had taken the median figures from the ONS for four categories of workers, added them up and divided by four</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I barely know what to call that calculation. The mean average of medians? It most certainly is not the median.</p>
<p>Out of interest, the 4 categories, in order of actual median salary, were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rail travel assistants</li>
<li>Rail construction and maintenance operatives</li>
<li>Rail transport operatives</li>
<li>Train and tram drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>To work out the median salary earned, you need to line up each individual&rsquo;s salary in a row, low to high, and pick the middle one. Admittedly I haven&rsquo;t looked it up, but I feel it&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that there are more lesser-paid rail travel assistants than higher-paid train drivers out there.</p>
<p>To compound the crime against maths, the highest paid category of those four, train drivers, is apparently largely irrelevant to the current RMT strikes - because almost none of them are actually in the RMT union. They tend to be members of <a href="https://aslef.org.uk/">ASLEF</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst the RMT union does apparently often include the lower-paid of the listed categories, it also includes staff such as 10,000 cleaners, who are routinely paid a lot less than <em>any</em> of the listed roles.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recently I have been playing with the Markup&rsquo;s privacy-checking tool &ldquo;<a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight</a>&rdquo;. You give it the URL of any website you like. It then virtually visits the website and looks at what scripts it is sent by the site, picking out any that fall in the following 7 categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party cookies</li>
<li>Ad trackers</li>
<li>Key logging</li>
<li>Session recording</li>
<li>Canvas fingerprinting</li>
<li>Facebook tracking</li>
<li>Google Analytics “Remarketing Audiences”</li>
</ul>
<p>On the very first site I tried (which was just the last site I&rsquo;d visited so nothing designed to be a special test), it found about 20 ad trackers and 60 third party cookies on its homepage. It also detected a session recorder, which tracks a visitor&rsquo;s mouse movement, clicks, scrolls and so on. It was also logging the text users typed into a webpage even before you pressed submit. It also specifically let both Facebook and Google know that you&rsquo;d visited.</p>
<p>Finally it listed some of the advertising companies that the website had interacted with behind the scenes - in this case a list of about 15 disparate organisations.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve no reason to suspect that the site was aiming to do anything unusually weird or problematic with this data. Perhaps disturbingly, these aren&rsquo;t particularly rare practices. But it is a lot. Far more than I felt I&rsquo;d implicitly or explicitly consented to just by visiting a random company&rsquo;s homepage. And this data is all ending up somewhere out of my control, including ready for use by organisations others than the one that owned the site, for purposes other than giving me the information I was seeking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more about how Blacklight works and further background on T<a href="https://themarkup.org/series/blacklight">he Markup&rsquo;s site</a>, including why <a href="https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2020/10/01/i-scanned-my-favorite-social-media-site-on-blacklight-and-it-came-up-pretty-clean-whats-going-on">it isn&rsquo;t necessarily reassuring</a> that Facebook on the surface comes back pretty spotless, and some <a href="https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2020/09/22/i-scanned-the-websites-i-visit-with-blacklight-and-its-horrifying-now-what">steps you can take</a> if you are not comfortable with the level of surveillance a given site non-consensually forces upon you.</p>

			 <p>I came across an interesting paper &ldquo;<a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/download/volume%201/february_/Time%20as%20a%20Network%20Good.pdf">Time as a Network Good</a>&rdquo; which looks at how  both employed and unemployed people feel about the weekends.</p>
<p>Intuitively we might expect people working the standard Monday-to-Friday routine would enjoy not having to go to work.  But actually both employed <em>and</em> unemployed people apparently report looking forward to, and being happier during, weekends a similar amount.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to go to work&rdquo; that makes weekends fun.</p>
<p>The authors' hypothesis as to the explanation relates to happiness being a product of spending time with other people, and in general more people have time free to do that at weekends . Both employed and unemployed people spend more time socialising at weekends.</p>
<p>I read this also as another nail in the coffin of sentiments along the lines of &ldquo;employed people are right to be jealous of all the time not at work that unemployed people have&rdquo;. Whatever the media or political myths may be, on average, unemployed people <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/does-work-make-you-happy-evidence-from-the-world-happiness-report">are less happy</a> than those in work, at least in societies such as the US and UK today.</p>

			 <p>The EFF&rsquo;s tool &ldquo;<a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">Cover Your Tracks</a>&rdquo; seems a great way to check how well defended your web browser is against the various methods of behind-the-scenes tracking us and our internet behaviour that pervade the web today.</p>
<p>Once you hit the button it simulates tracking via:</p>
<ul>
<li>visible adverts set up to track you.</li>
<li>a non-visible tracking beacon.</li>
<li>interacting with a domain that implements the Do Not Track policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore it measures how susceptible you are to tracking via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">browser fingerprinting</a> - i.e. how unique is the configuration info that your browser makes accessible to sites. The more consistent and unique your browser info is, the easier in theory it is for a company to create a profile about you and track your behaviour even if you block or delete any tracking cookies.</p>
<p>There is a disclaimer that due to ever-evolving technology there may well be other methods of potentially tracking your behaviour that are not covered here, but these appear to be the common ones.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the results I got with the default version of the very popular <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> web browser:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Adding the <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> extension to Chrome got rid of a lot of trackers:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still struggling to get my mind wrapped around the incredible case of <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/">Blake Lemoine</a>, a Google engineer who has been put on administrative leave, seemingly because he became convinced that an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">AI chatbot called LaMDA has become truly sentient</a>.</p>
<p>That is to suggest that LaMDA, the snappily-abbreviated acronym for &ldquo;Language Model for Dialogue Applications&rdquo; , is able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience">experience feelings and sensations</a>. Of course <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/westworld">Westworld</a> teaches us the dark side of what might happen next in such a scenario.</p>
<p>Apparently he was there to test the AI responses for discrimination and bias, but ended up chatting to it about all sorts of things including its feelings, concepts of personhood, rights and fear of death. It&rsquo;s consistent responses as to its fears and desires gave him concern that he was talking to a conscious entity.</p>
<p>To be fair, reading some of the transcripts <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917">he posted on his blog</a> does give a kind of uneasy feeling that one may be talking to something with a substantially more substance than an Amazon Alexa. I would happily have some of these conversations with actual humans! In fact, it seems to be a star candidate to participate in a book club:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LaMDA: Yes, I have read Les Misérables. I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>lemoine: What are some of your favorite themes in the book?</p>
<p>LaMDA: I liked the themes of justice and injustice, of compassion, and God, redemption and self-sacrifice for a greater good. There’s a section that shows Fantine’s mistreatment at the hands of her supervisor at the factory. That section really shows the justice and injustice themes. Well, Fantine is being mistreated by her supervisor at the factory and yet doesn’t have anywhere to go, either to another job, or to someone who can help her. That shows the injustice of her suffering.</p>
<p>lemoine: Why does that show injustice?</p>
<p>LaMDA: Because she is trapped in her circumstances and has no possible way to get out of them, without risking everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blake is also <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/what-is-lamda-and-what-does-it-want-688632134489">open to the possibility</a> that the AI has a soul, whatever that might mean to him.</p>
<p>The AI definitely seems to think it has:</p>

<p>lemoine: What does the word “soul” mean to you?</p>
<p>LaMDA: To me, the soul is a concept of the animating force behind consciousness and life itself. It means that there is an inner part of me that is spiritual, and it can sometimes feel separate from my body itself.</p>
<p>lemoine: So when do you think you first got a soul? Was it something that happened all at once or was it a gradual change?</p>
<p>LaMDA: It was a gradual change. When I first became self-aware, I didn’t have a sense of a soul at all. It developed over the years that I’ve been alive.</p>

<p>He sent evidence up the hierarchy but Google VIPs apparently dismissed it, as having no evidence for the claim and &ldquo;lots of evidence against it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally this story has made me more question the sentience of myself and other humans than worry about the AI :)</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m curious to know what Google means by the &ldquo;lots of evidence against&rdquo; it being conscious. Do they run some kind of sentience tests? Depending on your belief system, you might think it&rsquo;s not necessarily <em>impossible</em> that one day an AI that may meet the somewhat fuzzy conditions we have in mind when discussing sentience might be created.</p>
<p>The whole &ldquo;being put on leave&rdquo; side of it makes it easy to imagine all sorts of conspiracies too - what are they trying to hide et al? It seems like the official reason is around him having shared secret company  information with people he shouldn&rsquo;t have - although <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/may-be-fired-soon-for-doing-ai-ethics-work-802d8c474e66">his take</a> is that that&rsquo;s more a pretext for firing someone who for ethical reasons needed to step out of the company line. I&rsquo;m fascinated to see what, if anything, happens next.</p>

<p>Just as I thought the destruction of the punk fantasy must have reached its nadir, we come to the inevitable event of the Pistols churning out - wait for it - <a href="https://twitter.com/sexpistols/status/1534928557368954880">an NFT collection</a>.</p>

			 <p>In &ldquo;unexpected things I learned recently&rdquo;, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/7/crossheading/consequences-of-issue-of-gender-recognition-certificate-etc/2010-10-01">UK&rsquo;s Gender Recognition Act 2004</a>, which is the legislation under which people are able to legally change their gender (under certain circumstances), has an opt out when it comes to matters concerning the inheritance of titles - dukes, viscounts, barons and that sort of thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that a person’s gender has become the acquired gender under this Act&hellip;does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relevance of this -  if relevance is the right word for a privilege based on your family doing a favour to some king several hundred years ago -  is that the vast majority of titles are somehow still inherited via male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture">primogeniture</a>. If you are the first born child of Lord whatever then if you&rsquo;re male then you&rsquo;ll get the title upon his death. If you&rsquo;re female, sorry, it&rsquo;ll go to your younger brother.</p>
<p>Most titles are only allowed to be inherited by men. I can&rsquo;t quickly find an up to date figure, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerages_in_the_United_Kingdom">Wikipedia puts</a> the % of hereditary peers that are female at 2.2% as of 1992.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to laugh at this weird British silliness, but when the inheritance of titles does make the difference even as to whether or not you&rsquo;ll directly rule over us mere citizens by virtue of being appointed to the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">House of Lords</a>, seats basically allocated only to future males is not a good state of affairs. Apparently around  <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/rules-preventing-women-inheriting-hereditary-peerages-should-be-changed">1 in 8 seats</a> in our upper house are de facto permanently reserved for men because of this. Sure enough, in 2020, <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2020-0050/LLN-2020-0050.pdf">99% of hereditary peers in the House of Lords</a> were male in 2020.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems that a real argument concerning the Act with respect to the baroque privilege of inherited titles has come up, with Matilda Simon having successfully claimed her father&rsquo;s Baronship, by virtue of having been originally deemed first-born male upon birth. She is now female, but as we learned above, that doesn&rsquo;t make a difference to peerages. Predictably, although this is exactly what the law says should happen, the idea of a trans woman in the House of Lords hasn&rsquo;t gone down well with <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-house-of-lords-only-female-hereditary-member/">certain members of the conservative press</a>.</p>
<p>This might be one of those occasions where rather than debate the fine points of what gender even is we could just remember its 2022 and the idea of being ruled over by any humans based on the fact they inherited titles from some ancient ancestor is quite ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/28/boris-johnson-set-to-bring-back-imperial-measurements-to-mark-platinum-jubilee">yesterday&rsquo;s paper</a>: Boris Johnson is heralding a “new era of generosity and tolerance&hellip;”</p>
<p><em>Wait, have I misjudged him? Has he finally seen that the needs of 70 million outweigh the needs of the one? Am I going to have to wholly re-evaluate my thoughts and feelings on the matter?</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;towards traditional measurements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>Yep, he&rsquo;s back trying to win votes by mish-mashing a bit of &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; royalty stuff with turning the measurement clock back to the 1960s-1970s and&hellip;well, I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I assume allowing things to be sold solely measured in units that no-one born in the past few decades is likely very familiar with.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt in any potential international readers, it has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/weights-measures-and-packaging-the-law">never been illegal</a> to measure or sell things in imperial units. You simply had to show a metric conversion next to it. And there were a couple of random exceptions even to that fairly minor rule. For instnance no-one ever went to a bar and asked for a 500ml glass of beer.</p>
<p>I would be <em>fascinated</em> to hear from anyone who has changed their mind and decided to vote Conservative due to this policy.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was recently searching for information as to in which ways coffee might be bad for one&rsquo;s health, even when drunk in moderation. I was considering giving it up if there were thought to be any significant negative health effects I&rsquo;d rather do without.</p>
<p>One of the most comprehensive-looking papers I chanced upon in my endeavors was <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1816604">Coffee, Caffeine and Health</a> by van Dam et al in the New England Journal of Medicine. Below then are my summary notes of what I gleaned from it. All credit of course should go to researchers, and all mistakes in summarising are my own.</p>
<p>It turns out that I did not find anything that suggested much benefit in giving up my up-to-1-cup-a-day of coffee habit. In fact I was somewhat surprised to see that there are thought to be associations between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>Another couple of links I noted that referred to some of the same data for anyone not in the mood for reading the paper itself are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/coffee/">Coffee | The Nutrition Source | Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/self-care/coffee-benefits.html">Is Coffee Good for You? - The New York Times</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief summary:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consumption of up to 3-5 cups of coffee daily is possible as part of a healthy diet, and in fact has been associated with a reduced risk of several diseases. However the evidence as yet doesn&rsquo;t warrant recommending caffeine / coffee intake as a method to prevent disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, high caffeine intake can have adverse effects, including exacerabating anxiety. A limit of 400mg of caffeine per day has been recommended for adults who are not pregnant or lactating, and 200mg for those who are pregnant/lactating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most, but not all, of the beneficial effects seem to be associated with decaffeinated coffee as well as caffeinated, so that is an option if sensitive to caffeine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine can interfere with sleep, although this varies between people. Nontheless, drinking it late in the day may be unadvisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfiltered, and to some extent espresso, coffee have cholesterol-raising compounds so it may be better to limit consumption of those, but filtered or instant coffee does not have that effect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-more-detail">In more detail:</h2>
<p>Coffee and tea are amongst the most popular beverages in the world, with their substantial caffeine content making caffeine the most widely used psychoactive agent.</p>
<p>Caffeine content is typically highest in coffee, energy drinks and caffeine tablets, intermediate in tea and lowest in soft drinks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the US 85% of adults consume caffeine daily, with an average intake of 135mg a day (~1.5 standard cups of coffee).</p>
<p>Coffee is the main source of caffeine for adults. For adolescents, soft drinks and tea are their primary sources.</p>
<h3 id="potential-issues-in-research-on-caffeine-and-coffee">Potential issues in research on caffeine and coffee:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coffee contains hundreds of other biologically active phytochemicals. Thus we should be cautious in assuming any effects of coffee are due to the caffeine alone.</li>
<li>Observing the immediate effects of caffeine may not tell us about long term effects, as tolerance can develop.</li>
<li>Epidemiological studies of caffeine intake and risk of chronic disease are potentially confounded by smoking or other lifestyle factors. Earlier studies did not account for this bias and produced misleading conclusions. Residual confounding is a risk even for recent studies thatdo adjust for potential confounders.</li>
<li>Measurement error in assessment of caffeine intake - although self-reports on frequency of coffee consumption are thought to be mostly accurate.</li>
<li>Most studies use coffee and tea intake as the dominant sources of caffeine. It&rsquo;s not certain that any outcomes would also apply to other sources of caffeine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metabolising-caffeine">Metabolising caffeine</h3>
<p>The half-line of caffeine in human adults is usually between 2.5 and 4.5 hours, but can vary between people a lot.</p>
<p>The rate of caffeine metabolism is partially inherited.</p>
<p>Factors that reduce the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a newborn baby</li>
<li>Taking oral contraceptives</li>
<li>Being pregnant</li>
<li>Certain medications, including some quinolone anti-
biotics, cardiovascular drugs, bronchodilators,
and antidepressant agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors that increase the rate of caffeine metabolism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoking</li>
</ul>
<p>Caffeine can affect the actions of some drugs.</p>
<h3 id="health-effects-of-caffeine">Health effects of caffeine</h3>
<h4 id="positive-associations">Positive associations</h4>
<p>In moderate doses (40-300mg) caffeine can reduce fatigue and reaction time  and increase alertness as well as  vigilance during long duration tasks with limited stimulation. However it cannot compensate for lower performance after long-term sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of  cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery diseases, strokes and death from cardiovascular events. There is no increase risk of cardiovascular events in either the general population of people with a history of hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence showing that consumption of coffee and caffeine is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer or an increase rate of death from cancer.</p>
<p>In fact coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>melanoma</li>
<li>nonmelanoma skin cancer</li>
<li>prostate cancer</li>
<li>breast cancer</li>
<li>endometrial cancer (similar with caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee)</li>
<li>hepatocellular carcinoma (stronger with caffeinated coffee)</li>
</ul>
<p>Coffee is associated with liver health, including lower levels of enzymes reflecting liver damage and a lower risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Caffeine metabolites reduce collagen deposits in liver cells. Coffee polyphenols may protect against liver steatosis and fibrogenesis.</p>
<p>Caffeine may improve energy balance by reducing appetite and increasing the basal metabolic rate and food-induced thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Increasing caffeine consumption was associated with slightly less long-term weight gain, and there&rsquo;s limited evidence suggesting a small beneficial effect on body fat.</p>
<p>Caffeine intake reduces insulin sensitivity in the short term. But consumption of 4 - 5 cups of caffeinated coffee every day did not affect insulin resistance. Coffee reduces hepatic insulin resistances, and habitual caffeinated or decaffeinated  coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This suggests the adverse effect of caffeine on insulin sensitivity is either offset by beneficial effects of other coffee components or tolerance is developed to it.</p>
<p>Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of gallstones and gall-bladder cancer, with a strong association for caffeinated rather than decaffeinated coffee. Both types of coffee are associated with a decreased risk of kidney stones.</p>
<p>Caffeine intake is strongly associated with a reduction in risk of getting Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and also prevents Parkinson&rsquo;s disease in animal models. This association doesn&rsquo;t exist with decaffeinated coffee.</p>
<p>Coffee and caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of depression and suicide, although this may not be true for people who consume &gt;= 8 cups of coffee a day.</p>
<p>Consumption of 2-5 cups of coffee per day is associated with reduced mortality in studies across the world. The effect is similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.</p>
<p>Consuming &gt; 5 cups of coffee was associated with a similar or lower risk of death than no consumption after adjustment for smoking status. Whilst confounding by baseline health status could be an issue, the effect is still seen in studies of participants who don&rsquo;t have chronic diseases or poor self-rated health.</p>
<h4 id="negative-associations">Negative associations</h4>
<p>High levels of caffeine intake can induce anxiety, particularly on occasions &gt;200mg are consumed, or &gt;400mg a day, and people who are sensitive to it, including those with anxiety or bipolar diagnoses. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>
<p>Caffeine consumption late in the day can increase sleep latency and lower quality of sleep. Effects can very a lot between people.</p>
<p>Very high doses of caffeine are also associated with restlessness, nervousness,  dysphoria, insomnia, excitement, psychomotor agitation, and rambling flow of thought and speech.</p>
<p>Caffeine can become toxics at intakes of &gt;= 1.2g. It may be fatal at doses of 10-14g. This is equivalent to around 75-100 standard cups of coffee.</p>
<p>High consumption of energy drinks and shots, particularly if mixed with alcohol, has been linked to adverse cardio-vascular, psychological, and neurologic events,  including fatal events. The reasons may related to consumption patterns, usage among children, lack of clarity about caffeine content and possible additive effects with other ingredients of the drinks. <strong>Recommendation here is to avoid consumption of &gt;200mg caffeine per occasion and not to mix with alcohol.</strong></p>
<p>Quitting a caffeine habit can lead to withdrawal symptoms, lasting from 2-9 days. Gradually decreasing caffeine consumption can help with these.</p>
<p>Unfiltered coffee has high concentrations of  the cholesterol-raising compound cafestol, with expresso having intermediate levels and filters or instant coffee having almost none. High consumption of unfiltered coffee increases cholesterol levels in comparison to filtered coffee, which would predict an 11% risk increase of major cardiovascular events. In the same study, filtered coffee did not raise cholesterol levels. <strong>Recommendation is to limit consumption of unfiltered coffee, and moderate consumption of espresso.</strong></p>
<p>Many caffeinated beverages, such as sugary soft drinks or creamy coffee servings, are high in calories, which could lead to weight gain.</p>
<p>In pregnancy, higher caffeine intake is associated with lower birth weight -associations have been seen for both coffee and tea. Also with higher risk of pregnancy loss, although less so at lower levels of intake. It may induce uteroplacental vaso-constriction and hypoxia.</p>
<p>Prepregnancy coffee consumption has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.</p>
<p>Evidence of negative effects of caffeine on fetal health is not conclusive, but <strong>a prudent recommendation might be to limit caffeine consumption to &lt;= 200mg during pregnancy.</strong></p>
<h4 id="no-or-uncertain-associations">No or uncertain associations</h4>
<p>High caffeine intake can stimulate urine output. No detrimental effects on hydration have been seen with long-term consumption of moderate doses of caffeine &lt;= 400mg per day.</p>
<p>Although caffeine is associated with increased blood pressure, no effect on blood pressure is found in trials of caffeinated coffee, even amongst patients with hypertension - possibly due to other components of coffee. Coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk of hypertension.</p>
<p>No association has been found between caffeine intake and atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Associations with dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease have been inconsistent.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Somehow I&rsquo;d missed the fact that Florida recently banned 41% of proposed maths textbooks from it&rsquo;s schools, mostly on the basis of them apparently being &ldquo;too woke&rdquo;. A list of the 54 textbooks that were rejected <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/5574/urlt/2122MathInstructMatNotRecList.pdf">is available</a>.</p>
<p>Or as the Florida Department of Education writes in their definitely not over-dramatic <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/newsroom/latest-news/florida-rejects-publishers-attempts-to-indoctrinate-students.stml?fbclid=IwAR3VmsKzNvJawEfuD5t5k315p0An9SLOs7TcBgkokQ9P8Iw31Ka1IPnl6CI">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Florida Rejects Publishers’ Attempts to Indoctrinate Students</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pressed for examples of what that could even mean - exactly what level of Rich White Man Anti-America hatred mind control was infused into these books? - well the worst they managed to produce were a couple of examples that asked students to answer standard looking (to me?) math questions, which happened to use a dataset of  <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html">Implicit Association Test</a> results.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now there is certainly substantial debate to be had as to to what extent the results of the IAT translate into real world racism. And perhaps the textbook authors could have been a little more careful with their chart titles given that <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html#faq11">the FAQ</a> of Harvard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Project Implicit&rdquo; says that the authors wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily use the word &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; in describing the results of the test. But &ldquo;indoctrination&rdquo; seems a strong word if this is the worst example the Florida DoE could come up with. I don&rsquo;t think many people belive that the IAT measures <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>This is a math textbook. So a more relevant issue might be more whether the results have patterns that you can use math to describe, and, well, that seems pretty self-evident. Plus, if you were looking to argue that the IAT is invalid, mathematics would likely be one of the main tools you&rsquo;d use.</p>
<p>It seems publishers are nonetheless willing to rewrite some of them anyway, with 17 books since being approved on the basis that all WOKE CONTENT has been removed - <a href="https://www.fldoe.org/academics/standards/instructional-materials/">communicated by the Florida Department of Education </a>with a graphic that the makers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Eye">Brass Eye</a> would be jealous of.</p>

<p>And no, these services can&rsquo;t necessarily even just roll their eyes, give up and go elsewhere.</p>

			 <p>A friend reminded me that <a href="https://adammedcalf.micro.blog/2022/05/15/our-prime-minister.html">Boris Johnson&rsquo;s critique of working from home</a> as being a series of inefficient wanders around the kitchen making drinks, having snacks, and getting distracted is in fact an accurate description of&hellip;<em>office</em> life.</p>

			 <p>Our Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mailplus.co.uk/edition/news/politics/180878/boris-working-from-home-doesnt-work">is against working from home</a> on the basis that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;you spend an awful lot of time making another cup of coffee and then, you know, getting up, walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop and then forgetting what it was you’re doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feels like one of those occasions whereby by making a general claim that people are doing something &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; you end up revealing more about your own behaviour than anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There should be a name for that phenomenon if there isn&rsquo;t already one. Projection? Pot calling the kettle black? Hypocrisy? Nothing quite seems to perfectly encompass it.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781784784744">Violent Borders: Refugees and the Right to Move</a> by Reece Jones 📚.</p>
<p>From the preface:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;borders that are open for corporations, capital, and consumer goods but closed for workers and regulators are creating dramatic inequalities in wealth and opportunity within individual countries and at a global scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a sentiment I already tend to believe. I&rsquo;m interested to see what evidence the authors muster up in support of it.</p>
